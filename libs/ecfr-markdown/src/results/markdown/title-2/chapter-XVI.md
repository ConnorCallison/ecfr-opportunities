  PART 1600—NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

### Part 1600

**Authority:** Authority: Sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); E.O. 12549, 51 FR 6370, 3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189; E.O. 12689, 54 FR 34131, 3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235.

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 34953, May 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1600.137   Who in DFC may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1600.137

      The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of DFC or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the CEO of DFC or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the Governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 1600.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

#### § § 1600.215

      In addition to the nonprocurement transactions which are not covered transactions under 2 CFR 180.215, any nonprocurement transaction entered into under a primary tier nonprocurement transaction that does not require DFC explicit prior consent is not a covered transaction under 2 CFR 180.215(g)(2).

      § 1600.220   What contracts and subcontracts are covered transactions?

#### § § 1600.220

      First-tier procurements ( primary contracts) under a covered nonprocurement transaction are covered transactions. Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (see also optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), DFC does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement under a covered nonprocurement transaction. Moreover, for purposes of determining whether a procurement contract is included as a covered transaction, the threshold in 2 CFR 180.220(b) is increased from $25,000 to the “simplified acquisition threshold” as defined in 48 CFR 2.101.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      § 1600.332   What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 1600.332

      You, as a participant, must include a term or condition in lower-tier transactions that are covered transactions, requiring lower-tier participants to comply with the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, subpart C, as supplemented by this subpart.

    Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions

      § 1600.437   What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements for participating in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1600.437

      To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435, you must include provisions in the contractual documentation of the transaction to ensure compliance with 2 CFR part 180, subpart C, as supplemented by subpart C of this part. The provisions must also require the participant to include similar terms or conditions of compliance in lower-tier covered transactions.

    Subparts E-F [Reserved]

    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 1600.765   How may I request reconsideration of my DFC suspension?

#### § § 1600.765

      (a) If the DFC suspending official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.755 to continue your suspension after you present information in opposition to that suspension under 2 CFR 180.720, you can ask the suspending official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter.

      (b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

      (c) The suspending official must notify you of their decisions under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.

    Subpart H—Debarment

      § 1600.890   How may I request reconsideration of my DFC debarment?

#### § § 1600.890

      (a) If the DFC debarring official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.870 to debar you after you present information in opposition to a proposed debarment under 2 CFR 180.815, you can ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter.

      (b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

      (c) DFC may debar a person or entity for refusing to engage in efforts to remediate identified environmental, social, and human rights harm stemming from their activities, including harm that may be identified through a DFC Office of Accountability complaints process.

      (d) The debarring official must notify you of their decisions under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.

    Subpart I—Definitions

      § 1600.930   Debarring official.

#### § § 1600.930

      The debarring official for DFC is the Vice President & Chief Administrative Officer, Office of Administration, or designee as delegated in Agency policy.

    § 1600.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 1600.10

    This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) regulations for non-procurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for DFC to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189); Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235); and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103-355 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note).

    § 1600.20   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1600.20

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see 2 CFR part 180, subpart B, and the definition of “non-procurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970);

    (b) Respondent in a DFC suspension or debarment action;

    (c) DFC suspending or debarring official; and

    (d) DFC investment, guarantee, insurance or grant official authorized to enter into any type of non-procurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

    § 1600.30   What regulations must I follow?

#### § § 1600.30

    The DFC regulations that you must follow are the regulations specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number or by additional provisions with no corresponding section number. For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, DFC regulations are those in the OMB guidance.
