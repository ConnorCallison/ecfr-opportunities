      (h)  No commodity shipped out of a free port or bonded warehouse is eligible for USAID financing if it was shipped to the free port or bonded warehouse without compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or if it was shipped from the free port or bonded warehouse without compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.

      (i)  The purchase price for the commodity shall satisfy the requirements of subpart G.

      (j)  Commodities procured with funds made available under this part 201 shall be purchased from eligible suppliers. The rules on the nationality of suppliers of commodities are in section 228.14 of this chapter.

      (k)  The commodity shall be approved in writing by USAID for each purchase transaction as eligible for USAID financing. Such approval shall be indicated on the Application for Approval of Commodity Eligibility (Form AID 11) submitted to USAID by the supplier.

      § 201.12   Eligibility of incidental services.

#### § § 201.12

      Incidental services may be financed under the same implementing document which makes funds available for the procurement of equipment only if:

      (a) Such services are specified in the purchase contract relating to the equipment;

      (b) The price satisfies the requirements of § 201.68;

      (c) The portion of the total purchase contract price attributable to such services does not exceed 25 percent; and

      (e) The supplier of such services meets the requirements of § 228.25 of this chapter.

> [55 FR 34232, Aug. 22, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 38027, July 16, 1997]

      § 201.13   Eligibility of delivery services.

#### § § 201.13

      (a)  Delivery of USAID-financed commodities may be financed under the implementing document provided the delivery services meet the requirements of this section and the applicable provisions in part 228, subpart C of this chapter.

      (b)  USAID will not finance transportation costs:

      (1) For shipment beyond the point of entry in the cooperating country except when intermodal transportation service covering the carriage of cargo from point of origin to destination is used, and the point of destination, as stated in the carrier's through bill of lading, is established in the carrier's tariff; or

      (2) On a transportation medium owned, operated or under the control of any country not included in Geographic Code 935; or

      (3) Under any ocean or air charter covering full or part cargo (whether for a single voyage, consecutive voyages, or a time period) which has not received prior approval by USAID/W, Office of Procurement, Transportation Division); or

      (4) Which are attributable to brokerage commissions which exceed the limitations specified in § 201.65(h) or to address commissions, dead freight, demurrage or detention.

      (c)  USAID will finance inspection of USAID-financed commodities when inspection is required by USAID, or in those cases where inspection is required by the importer and such inspection is specified in the purchase contract, performed by independent inspectors and is either customary in export transactions for the commodity involved or is necessary to determine conformity of the commodities to the contract. Section 228.24 of this chapter covers the nationality requirements for suppliers of inspection services.

      (d)  (1) Unless otherwise authorized, USAID will finance premiums for marine insurance including war risk on USAID-financed commodities only if:

      (i) The insurance is placed in a country included in the authorized Geographic Code: Provided, that if the authorized Geographic Code is any other than USAID Geographic Code 000, the cooperating country itself shall be recognized as an eligible source; and

      (ii) Such insurance is placed either in accordance with the terms of the commodity purchase contract or on the written instructions of the importer; and

      (iii) Insurance coverage relates only to the period during which the commodities are in transit to the cooperating country, except that it may include coverage under a warehouse-to-warehouse clause; and

      (iv) The premiums do not exceed the limitations contained in § 201.68; and

      (v) The insurance provides that loss payment proceeds shall be paid in U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currency.

      (2) Within the meaning of § 201.11(e), as well as this paragraph, insurance is placed in a country only if payment of the insurance premium is made to, and the insurance policy is issued by, an insurance company office located in that country.

      (e)  In order to be eligible for USAID financing, the costs of any delivery services must be paid to carriers, insurers, or suppliers of inspection services who, prior to approval of the USAID Commodity Approval Application, have neither been suspended nor debarred under USAID Regulation 8, 22 CFR part 208, nor included on the “Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs” published by the U.S. General Services Administration.

> [55 FR 34232, Aug. 22, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 38027, July 16, 1997]

      § 201.14   Eligibility of bid and performance bonds and guaranties.

#### § § 201.14

      The cost of any bid bond or guaranty posted by a successful bidder or of any performance bond or guaranty posted by a supplier is eligible for financing under the implementing document, provided that the bond or guaranty conforms to the requirements of the invitation for bids or the contract, as applicable, and to the extent that the principal amount of the bond or guaranty does not exceed the amount customary in international trade for the type of transaction and commodity involved. Bonds or guaranties may be payable in U.S. dollars, or a freely convertible currency or local currency, and shall be posted in favor of the purchaser. Nationality requirements for sureties, insurance companies or banks who issue bonds or guaranties under USAID-financed transactions are set forth in § 228.38(b) of this chapter.

> [55 FR 34232, Aug. 22, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 38027, July 16, 1997]

      § 201.15   U.S. flag vessel shipping requirements.

#### § § 201.15

      (a)  Unless USAID determines that privately owned U.S. flag commercial ocean vessels are not available at fair and reasonable rates for such vessels:

      (1) At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross tonnage (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers from each of two geographic areas—the U.S. and all other countries) of all goods financed by USAID which are transported on ocean vessels shall be transported on privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels; and

      (2) At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross freight revenue generated by all shipments of USAID-financed commodities which are transported to the territory of the borrower/grantee on dry cargo liners shall be paid to or for the benefit of privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels.

      (b)  (1) Compliance with these requirements with respect to dry cargo liner vessels shall be achieved for the total of liner shipments made during the term of the loan or grant agreement. If USAID determines at any time during the term of the agreement that compliance may not be achieved, USAID may require that all subsequent shipments be made on U.S. flag liners until compliance is assured.

      (2) Compliance with these requirements with respect to dry bulk carriers and tankers shall be achieved for each quantitative unit of cargo. A quantitative unit of cargo is the total tonnage of a commodity or commodities included in one invitation for bids or other solicitation of offers from ocean carriers for the transportation of cargo which may move in full shipload lots. USAID shall approve a charter or other contract of affreightment for a non-U.S. flag vessel only if USAID has determined that at least 50% of the quantitative unit will move on U.S. flag vessels, to the extent that such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for such vessels. U.S. flag dry cargo liners whose offers are responsive to the terms of the invitation for bids or other solicitation of vessels may be used for achieving compliance for the quantitative unit.

      (c)  Upon application of the borrower/grantee or the supplier, USAID/W, Office of Procurement, Transportation Division, shall determine and advise the applicant whether or not privately owned U.S. flag vessels are available for any specific shipment of commodities at fair and reasonable rates. A determination that U.S. flag vessels are not available does not carry with it the authorization for USAID to finance freight on a vessel not otherwise authorized; this requires a separate waiver approval in accordance with § 201.13(b)(1)(ii).

      (d)  The borrower/grantee is responsible for compliance with the requirements of this section and for imposing upon subborrowers, contractors and importers such requirements regarding shipping arrangements with suppliers as will assure discharge of this responsibility.

      (e)  For purposes of this section the term “privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels” shall not include any vessel which, subsequent to September 21, 1961, shall have been either built outside the U.S., rebuilt outside the U.S. or documented under any foreign registry until such vessel shall have been documented under the laws of the U.S. for a period of 3 years.

    Subpart C—Procurement Procedures; Responsibilities of Importers

      § 201.20   Purpose.

#### § § 201.20

      This subpart prescribes procurement procedures which shall apply to an importer whenever a commodity procurement is to be financed by USAID subject to this part 201.

      § 201.21   Notice to supplier.

#### § § 201.21

      The importer is responsible for providing the supplier with the following information (either through the invitation for bids, the request for quotations or otherwise):

      (a) Notice that the transaction is to be financed by USAID under this part 201;

      (b) The identification number of the implementing document;

      (c) All additional information prerequisite to USAID financing and contained in the instructions from the borrower/grantee to the importer (for example, eligible source of commodity, periods during which deliveries must be made, shipping provisions, and documentation requirements); and, where appropriate,

      (d) Notice of the marking requirements in § 201.31(d), when the importer is the government of the cooperating country or any if its subdivisions or instrumentalities.

      § 201.22   Procurement under public sector procedures.

#### § § 201.22

      (a)  When the importer is the government of the cooperating country or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, all purchase contracts for commodities shall be awarded under public sector procedures in this section unless otherwise authorized by USAID. Such contracts shall be awarded on a competitive basis unless otherwise authorized by USAID under paragraph (g) of this section.

      (b)  Formal competitive bidding procedures shall be used for all procurements estimated to exceed $100,000 or the equivalent, exclusive of ocean or air transportation costs, except when other procedures are authorized in accordance with this section. Formal competitive bidding procedures may also be used for procurements under $100,000 at the option of the importer. Formal competitive bidding procedures include advertising the availability of an invitation for bids in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, issuance of the invitation for bids, public opening of sealed bids, evaluation of bids, and award of the contract, except as provided in § 201.22(b)(3), to the lowest responsive bid by a responsible bidder.

      (1)  The invitation for bids and every attachment and amendment thereto shall be in the English language and shall be available to prospective suppliers free of charge unless otherwise authorized by USAID. The following minimum requirements are applicable:

      (i)  The invitation for bids shall state specifically that the formal competitive bidding procedures set forth in this § 201.22 apply. The terms and conditions of the procurement shall be clearly indicated, including any factors other than price to be used in the evaluation. Commodity specifications shall be stated in a non-restrictive manner and in sufficient detail to permit maximum response from prospective suppliers. The metric system of measurements shall be used for specifications unless USAID determines in writing that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets to U.S. firms.

      (ii)  The invitation for bids shall be appropriately numbered and state the complete physical address, as well as any post office box number, to which bids or offers are to be sent, the closing hour and date for submission and the date, hour and place of the public opening of the bids. If additional drawings, details, regulations or forms are necessary for submitting a bid, the invitation shall state where such material may be obtained.

      (iii)  The invitation for bids shall expressly indicate the extent to which any resulting contract is subject to the requirements of this part 201.

      (iv)  The invitation for bids shall state that no bid received at the address designated in the invitation after the closing hour and date for submission will be considered for award unless its late arrival at that address is attributable solely to mishandling of the bid documents by the importer or any of its agents directly associated with receiving or processing the bids. In no case will the importer consider a bid which was not received at the place of public opening before the award was made.

      (2)  Bids received shall be held intact and sealed and shall be safeguarded against disclosure of contents prior to bid opening. The bids shall be opened publicly as specified in the bid invitation, and all properly submitted bids shall be considered. Direct submission of a bid by a prospective supplier, rather than through an agent or other representative of the supplier in the cooperating country, shall not be cause for rejection.

      (3)  Every award shall be made to that responsible bidder whose responsive bid is lowest in price. If any factor other than price is used in evaluating bids, each such factor shall be computed in accordance with the formula in the invitation for bids.

      (c)  Subject to the approval of USAID, two-stage formal competitive bidding may be used in the procurement of specialized equipment, where requirements are stated in performance-type specifications. Two-stage bidding involves a request for technical proposals for the equipment being purchased, submission of proposals without price information, discussions with the offerors as necessary to clarify proposals, followed by a request for priced bids for those proposals found to be fully acceptable following discussions between the offerors and the purchaser. The priced bids shall be publicly opened. Handling and award of the bids shall comply with paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.

      (d)  (1) If approved by USAID based on a written record of the reasons therefor, a competitive negotiation procedure may be used. Competitive negotiation procedures include advertising the availability of a request for quotations in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, issuance of the request for quotations, receipt and evaluation of offers, negotiation (when appropriate), and award of the contract to the offeror submitting the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered. Competitive negotiation procedures may be approved in the following circumstances:

      (i) When it is impossible to develop adequate commodity specifications for use in an invitation for bids;

      (ii) When price alone would not be an effective means of determining an award (, when criteria, such as time of delivery or service capability need to be evaluated);

      (iii) When emergency procurement is justified by a demonstration that the time required for formal competitive bid procedures would result in an unacceptable delay in delivering the commodities;

      (iv) When proprietary procurement is justified; or

      (v) When adherence to formal competitive procedures would impair program objectives.

      (2) When formal competitive bidding procedures have failed, all bids have been rejected, and further use of such procedures would clearly not be productive, the Mission Director may authorize the use of competitive negotiation procedures. Further advertising is not required. The request for quotations may be prepared as a new document or may incorporate appropriate provisions of the invitation for bids. It shall be submitted to those potential suppliers who originally submitted bids in response to the invitation for bids.

      (e)  When the estimated value of the contract does not exceed $100,000 or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), the purchaser may award a contract by advertising the procurement in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section and soliciting quotations from a reasonable number of sources, including, where feasible, producers of the commodity, taking into consideration:

      (1) The nature of the commodities to be purchased;

      (2) The number of sources which can supply the commodities;

      (3) The value of the procurement; and

      (4) The administrative cost of procuring the commodities.

      (f)  Purchasing by brand or trade name or by a restrictive specification (proprietary procurement) may be justified for reasons such as:

      (1) Substantial benefits, such as economies in maintenance of spare parts inventories, stronger local dealer organization, better repair facilities, or greater familiarity by operating personnel, can be achieved through standardizing on a particular brand;

      (2) Compatibility with equipment on hand is required; or

      (3) Special design or operational characteristics are required.

      (g) —(1)  Competition may be waived and negotiation with a single source authorized by USAID under one of the following circumstances:

      (i) the purchaser can demonstrate the existence of an emergency situation in which the requirement for competition would result in an unacceptable delay in the procurement of the commodities;

      (ii) proprietary procurement is justified and the necessary commodities or spare parts are available from only one source, taking into account any special requirements such as the need for in-country service capability; or

      (iii) adherence to competitive procedures would result in the impairment of the objectives of the United States foreign assistance program or would not be in the best interest of the United States.

      (2)  Negotiation with a single source to amend an existing contract outside the scope of the contract must be justified under one or more of the criteria in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and formally approved by USAID.

      (h) —(1)  (i) For each procurement estimated to exceed $25,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), notice of the availability of the invitation for bids, request for quotations or specific information about procurements under $100,000 shall be published by the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Minority Resource Center in the appropriate USAID Bulletin. The purchaser shall submit three copies of each invitation for bids or request for quotations (if any) to the USAID Mission with its request for advertising. The Mission will forward the request for advertising and the procurement documents to USAID/W. The request for advertising should arrive in the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Minority Resource Center at least 45 days prior to the final date for receiving bids or quotations. The purchaser may, in addition, advertise in appropriate local, regional, and international journals, newspapers, etc., and otherwise, in accordance with local practice.

      (ii) Additionally, if the estimated value of the contract is more than $100,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), the notice of availability of the invitation for bids or request for quotations shall be published in the “Commerce Business Daily” of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

      (2)  (i) When negotiation with a single source has been authorized, advertising is not required.

      (ii) When formal competitive bid procedures have failed to result in an award pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section and a determination is made to follow competitive negotiation procedures, no further advertising is required.

      (iii) The requirements for advertising as set forth above may be waived by USAID to avoid serious procurement delays in certain circumstances, provided, however, that efforts shall be made to secure bids or offers from a reasonable number of potential suppliers.

      (i)  (1) Each invitation for bids or request for quotations for an USAID-financed procurement which is estimated to exceed $100,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), must be approved by USAID prior to issuance.

      § 201.23   Procurement under private sector procedures.

#### § § 201.23

      (a)  Procurements under private sector procedures will normally be carried out by importers using negotiated procurement procedures, unless the importer chooses to follow the procedures in § 201.22. Procurement on a negotiated basis shall be in accordance with good commercial practice. Solicitations by the importer for quotations or offers shall be made uniformly to a reasonable number of prospective suppliers, including, where feasible, producers of a commodity, and all quotations or offers received, whether or not specifically solicited, shall be given consideration before making an award.

      (b)  To provide suppliers in the United States with an opportunity to participate in furnishing commodities which may be purchased on a negotiated basis under USAID financing, USAID will periodically publish for each cooperating country a list of commodities which may be expected to be imported and the names and contact information for the importers which have traditionally purchased those commodities. Interested suppliers may then make offers or furnish quotations on the products they desire to sell directly to the importers of those products. USAID will not publicize specific proposed purchases which are to be undertaken by private sector importers on a negotiated basis unless specifically requested to do so by the importer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

      (c)  If the importer elects to solicit quotations and offers for specific proposed purchases through publication by USAID, USAID will notify prospective suppliers of the export opportunity through the appropriate USAID bulletin. Requests for such notification shall be submitted to the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Minority Resource Center, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7700, and shall contain the name and contact information for the importer, a full description of the commodities and any commodity related services required, applicable price and delivery terms and other relevant procurement data, in the English language. The metric system of measurements shall be used for specifications unless USAID determines in writing that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets to U.S. firms.

      (d)  USAID may require that the importer furnish an abstract in the English language and identify thereon all offers or quotations received, the offer accepted or order placed, the price, the quantity, the name and address of all persons submitting offers or quotations and of their principals, if any (including manufacturers or processors of the commodity).

      (e) —(1) Solicitation of offers from more than one supplier is not required if:

      (i) The importer is purchasing for resale or processing, as the supplier's regularly authorized distributor or dealer, a commodity which, under the terms of the distributorship or dealer agreement, the importer is precluded from buying from another supplier; or

      (ii) The importer is purchasing for resale a registered brand-name commodity from a supplier who is the exclusive distributor of that commodity to the area of the importer.

      (2) USAID may require the importer to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to USAID documentary evidence of the existence of the relationships described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (i) By the commodity supplier whenever USAID-finances any portion of the dollar price of a commodity sale under c.&f. or c.i.f. delivery terms, or

      (ii) By the supplier of ocean transportation whenever USAID-finances the freight under any freight reimbursement arrangement.

      (4)  (i) A copy (or photostat) of the bill(s) of lading (ocean, charter party, air, rail, barge, or truck) or parcel post receipt evidencing shipment from the point of export in the source country or free port or bonded warehouse.

      (ii) When the commodity is transported to the cooperating country under its own power (e.g., a fishing vessel), USAID will require a certificate signed by the importer or its authorized agent, certifying that the commodity has been received by the importer, to be submitted instead of a bill of lading.

      (iii) When the supplier is not responsible under the terms of its agreement with the importer for assuring that the commodities are loaded on board the vessel, such as when delivery terms are f.a.s. port of shipment, the importer may request and the Commodity Support Division, Office of Procurement, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7900 may authorize the following documents, instead of a bill of lading, to be submitted with a claim for reimbursement or payment for the commodities:

    Subpart G—Price Provisions

      § 201.60   Purpose and applicability of this subpart.

#### § § 201.60

      This subpart prescribes rules relating to prices, discounts, commissions, credits, allowances, and other payments. These rules shall be observed in the procurement of commodities and commodity-related services financed under this part. The rules implement and supplement the requirements of the Act relating to prices in such procurement. The general purpose of these rules is to assure the prudent use of USAID funds.

      (a)  (1) Section 604(a) of the Act provides  that funds made available under this Act may be used for procurement outside the United States only if the price of any commodity procured in bulk is lower than the market price prevailing in the United States at the time of procurement adjusted for differences in the cost of transportation to destination, quality, and terms of payment.

      (2) Section 604(b) of the Act provides that no funds made available under this Act shall be used for the purchase in bulk of any commodities at prices higher than the market price prevailing in the United States at the time of purchase, adjusted for differences in the cost of transportation to destination, quality, and terms of payment.

      (b)  The rules and conditions prescribed by this subpart apply to all USAID-financed transactions subject to this regulation, whether or not the commodities are purchased in bulk.

      (c)  Compliance with this subpart G and with any additional price requirement contained in the implementing document shall be a condition to the financing by USAID of procurement transactions under this part. Post-audit of transactions will be made by USAID to determine whether there has been such compliance.

      § 201.61   Meaning of terms in this subpart.

#### § § 201.61

      (a)  means any group of purchasers which is separately identifiable and which is distinguishable from other purchasers on the basis of quantity purchased, distribution function or established trade practice.

      (b)  See § 201.01(h).

      (c)  means any comparable sale not in export transactions.

      (d)  means any comparable sale in export transactions.

      (e)  means any sale of or bona fide offer to sell the same commodity, or (in the absence of such a sale or offer to sell) any sale of or offer to sell a similar commodity which, with respect to the quantity, quality, grade, period of delivery, supply area, terms of sale, or class of purchaser, either:

      (1) Is not sufficiently different from the sale being tested to result customarily in a price different from the price in the sale being tested; or

      (2) Can be related to the sale being tested through application of a customary price differential. A sale which is otherwise comparable to another sale is not rendered noncomparable by virtue of its being made out of a free port or bonded warehouse. The fact that a sale is made out of a free port or bonded warehouse shall not cause that sale to differ from otherwise comparable sales with respect to terms of sale, supply area, or period of delivery.

      (f) The  means the date on which the parties agree on the price. If, however, the parties establish the price as of any other date which is subsequent to the date of such agreement and not later than the date of delivery, the term means such other date regardless of whether it precedes, coincides with or follows the legally effective date of the purchase contract.

      (g)  means the customary difference in price, if any, between domestic sales and otherwise comparable export sales.

      (h)  means the length of time between the date the purchase price is fixed or the date of the purchase contract, whichever is later, and the date by which delivery is to be completed.

      (i)  means any person who grows, mines, manufactures, processes, or assembles a commodity in the form in which it is exported.

      (j)  means the total amount which the purchaser agrees to pay or make available to or for the benefit of the supplier (including any person or organization designated by the supplier to receive such payment) for any commodity or commodity-related service which is wholly or partly financed by USAID.

      (k)  means any entity affiliated with the importer by ownership or management ties, and any office or employee of such entity.

      (l)  means a commodity which is functionally interchangeable with the commodity in the sale being tested, and affords the purchaser substantially equivalent serviceability.

      (m)  means the source country, or if the commodity is customarily sold at different prices (exclusive of transportation costs) from different geographic areas within a source country, the specific geographic area within the source country from which the commodity is shipped to the cooperating country.

      (n)  means that period encompassing the date the purchase price is fixed during which prices in comparable sales remain substantially constant.

      (o)  means the cost of all transportation by land, sea, or air from the port of export to the destination in the cooperating country, plus the cost of marine insurance, if any, covering such transaction. Such costs are financed by USAID only to the extent provided in § 201.13.

      § 201.62   Responsibilities of borrower/grantee and of supplier.

#### § § 201.62

      (a)  The borrower/grantee shall:

      (1) When required by USAID, develop and periodically update, or cooperate with USAID in the development and updating of, lists of importers who have traditionally imported the commodities which may be purchased under the loan or grant. Such listings shall be by commodity groupings selected by USAID, cover all commodities eligible for financing, and, to the extent such information is available, show the names and addresses of all importers, regardless of the source from which their imports originated.

      (2) Insure that the importer

      (i) Procures in accordance with the conditions set forth in subpart C as applicable, and

      (ii) Except as provided otherwise in § 201.22, pays no more than the lowest available competitive price, including transportation cost, for the commodity.

      (b)  In accordance with the provisions contained in the Supplier's Certificate, which the supplier must execute in order to receive payment, the supplier is responsible for compliance with the provisions of this subpart G, other than paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 201.63   Maximum prices for commodities.

#### § § 201.63

      (a)  The purchase price for a commodity, the source of which is the United States, shall not exceed the market price prevailing in comparable export sales in the United States at the time of purchase, adjusted for differences in the transportation cost:  That if there are no such comparable export sales, then the purchase price, excluding transportation cost, may not exceed the market price prevailing in comparable domestic sales in the United States at the time of purchase, adjusted upward or downward by the appropriate export differential.

      (b)  The purchase price, including transportation cost, for a commodity the source of which is not the United States shall be lower than the market price prevailing in comparable export sales in the United States at the time of purchase including transportation cost:  That if there are no such comparable export sales in the United States, then the purchase price from the source outside the United States, including transportation cost, must be lower than the market price prevailing in comparable domestic sales in the United States at the time of purchase, adjusted upward or downward by the appropriate export differential and transportation cost.

      (c)  (1) The purchase price excluding transportation cost, shall not exceed prices generally charged by the supplier in comparable export sales from the source country at the time of purchase.

      (2) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to the purchase price:

      (i) In any sale under formal competitive bid procedures; or

      (ii) In any sale of a commodity generally traded on an organized commodity exchange.

      (3)  for the purpose of paragraph (c) of this section shall not include sales:

      (i) Under formal competitive bid procedures; or

      (ii) Of a commodity by a supplier to affiliates if the supplier demonstrates an established practice of selling the commodity to affiliates at prices lower than the prices it charges to nonaffiliates.

      (d)  The purchase price, excluding transportation cost, shall not exceed the market price prevailing in the source country in comparable export sales at the time of purchase:  That, if there are no such comparable export sales, then the purchase price, excluding transportation cost, shall not exceed the market price prevailing in comparable domestic sales in the source country at the time of purchase, adjusted upward or downward by the appropriate export differential.

      (e) —(1)  The purchase price shall not exceed the sum of:

      (i) The lower of the following: The price paid by the supplier for the commodity or the price charged by the producer in the original sale of that specific commodity; and

      (ii) A markup over the amount allowed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section which may not exceed the lower of the following: The markup over direct cost that is usual and customary in sales by the supplier of the same commodity, if any, or the most similar commodity, or, the markup over direct cost that is usual and customary in such sales by the competitors of the supplier; and

      (iii) To the extent not included in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section an amount not to exceed the cost at prevailing rates of those expenses recognized in § 201.64(a) and actually incurred in moving the commodities supplied from the point of purchase to a position alongside or on board the vessel or other export conveyance at point of export.

      (2)  The purchase price shall not exceed a price established in accordance with the customary pricing practices of the supplier for other products of the same general class as the commodity sold.

      (f)  (1) The purchase price, including transportation costs to a cooperating country, of a commodity which has passed through a free port or bonded warehouse shall not exceed:

      (i) The maximum price f.o.b. or f.a.s. source country eligible for USAID-financing under the foregoing provisions of this § 201.63: plus

      (ii) Transportation cost calculated on the basis of the prevailing ocean freight rate for shipments using the most direct route from the source country to the cooperating country on the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity actually moved from the free port or bonded warehouse to the cooperating country.

      (2) The purchase price of a commodity f.o.b. or f.a.s. a free port or bonded warehouse shall not exceed the maximum price established in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, minus transportation costs from the free port or bonded warehouse to the cooperating country, calculated on the basis of the prevailing ocean freight rate from the free port or bonded warehouse to the cooperating country for the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity actually moved between those points.

      (g)  If a purchase contract contains a price escalation clause, USAID will finance:

      (1) The purchase price of the commodity before the operation of the escalation clause to the extent that it does not exceed the applicable price limitations contained in this subpart; and

      (2) That portion of the commodity price attributable to the operation of the price escalation clause if such clause:

      (i) Uses a formula based on variations in a cost factor which is reasonably related to the price of the commodity subject to escalation and is readily determinable;

      (ii) Provides for downward as well as upward adjustment of the price; and

      (iii) Accords with recognized trade practices.

      § 201.64   Application of the price rules to commodities.

#### § § 201.64

      (a)  In testing whether the purchase price of a commodity exceeds the price in comparable export sales or in comparable domestic sales, as applicable under § 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), it is necessary to insure that the price being tested as well as the prices being used as a test or measurement are calculated on the basis of delivery alongside or on board the vessel or other export conveyance. Such prices will include, therefore, in addition to the price of the commodity at an internal point in the source country, transportation from that point to the port of export in the source country, and to the extent not already included in the price at the internal point, inspection, export packing, forwarder's fees at customary rates, the cost of placing the commodities on board the vessel or export conveyance (unless this cost is covered in the export freight), and other necessary costs customary in the trade.

      (b)  (1) In testing the purchase price which includes transportation cost (customarily known as a c. & f. or c.i.f. price) for compliance with the requirements of § 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), USAID will subtract transportation cost as calculated by reference to the freight rate, for the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity was shipped, prevailing on the date the purchase price is fixed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the actual transportation cost paid by the supplier shall be presumed to be the transportation cost calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the foregoing sentence.

      (2) In testing a purchase price involving transportation cost for compliance with § 201.62 and § 201.63(b), the test or measurement prices shall be:

      (i) Prices based upon transportation by a U.S.-flag vessel if the price tested involves transportation by such vessel; or

      (ii) Prices based upon transportation by either a U.S.-flag or a foreign-flag vessel, whichever is lower, if the price tested involves transportation by a foreign-flag vessel.

      (c)  (1) When a shipment to a cooperating country has passed through a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following:

      (i) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1), or

      (ii) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of § 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D), and any transportation costs out of the free port or bonded warehouse on a vessel flying the flag of a country included in the authorized geographic code.

      (2) When a shipment is f.o.b. or f.a.s. a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following:

      (i) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(2), or

      (ii) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of § 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D).

      (d)  In the determination of any prevailing market price of any commodity or any prevailing price or maximum eligible freight rate for a commodity related service, relevant published and unpublished price information will be considered.

      § 201.65   Commissions, discounts and other payments, credits, benefits and allowances.

#### § § 201.65

      (a)  This section sets forth the rules which govern the eligibility of commissions, discounts and certain other payments, credits, benefits and allowances for USAID-financing.

      (b)  Unless otherwise provided in the implementing document, a commission paid, or to be paid, to a bona fide agent of the supplier is eligible for financing under this part, if such agent either has made a direct and substantial contribution toward securing the purchase contract for the supplier or is engaged on a continuing basis in securing similar contracts for the supplier. Such commissions are eligible to the extent they comply with § 201.65(f).

      (c)  Unless otherwise authorized by USAID, no commission or other payment, credit, benefit or allowance of any kind shall be paid, made, or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, in connection with any sale subject to this part by the supplier or its agent:

      (1) To or for the benefit of the importer;

      (2) To or for the benefit of a purchasing agent or other agent or representative of an importer, even though such agent or representative may also have an agreement with a supplier to represent the supplier; or

      (3) To any third party in connection with a sale by the supplier to its dealer, distributor, or established agent in the cooperating country.

      (d)  To arrive at the net amount eligible for USAID-financing, all trade discounts, whether in the form of payments, credits, or allowances, to which the importer is entitled shall be deducted from the gross amount of the supplier's invoice submitted under § 201.52(a)(2)(i)(D).

      (e)  Every commission or other payment, credit, benefit, or allowance of any kind paid, made or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, in connection with the sale of commodities financed under this part to any person described in § 201.65(c) (1), (2) or (3) shall be presumed conclusively to have been paid from USAID funds and shall thereby be subject to the requirements of this part 201.

      (f)  A commission shall not exceed the lesser of the amount which the supplier customarily pays in connection with similar transactions or the amount which is customary in the trade.

      (g)  All commissions and other payments, credits, benefits or allowances of any kind paid, made or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, by the supplier in connection with USAID-financed sales of commodities and commodity-related services shall be fully reported on the Invoice-and-Contract Abstract of the Supplier's Certificate required under § 201.52(a)(6). Any such amounts not reported shall be ineligible for USAID-financing.

      (h)  In connection with ocean freight services, USAID will finance a brokerage commission only if:

      (1) Such commission does not exceed 2  percent of the ocean freight charge (exclusive of deadfreight, demurrage and detention);

      (2) Such commission is payable to an individual resident in a country included in the authorized source code; a non-resident citizen of a country included in the authorized source code; or a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of a country included in the authorized source code; and

      (3) The names of all persons receiving such commissions appear on the face of the charter party.

      (i)  An address commission to or for the benefit of a charterer shall be deemed a discount on the stated freight rate or freight charge which the supplier of transportation services shall deduct from the cost of transportation financed by USAID. If the supplier of the commodity is the charterer, it shall refund to USAID any address commission received by it. If the supplier of the commodity is not the charterer, the borrower/grantee shall be responsible for making a refund to USAID of any such commissions received by the charterer.

      § 201.66   Side payments.

#### § § 201.66

      Any payment which an importer makes to a supplier, whether or not indicated on the supplier's invoice and whether or not financed by USAID, in connection with an USAID-financed transaction, shall be disclosed by the supplier on the Supplier's Certificate and shall be considered as part of the actual purchase price in applying the rules of this subpart G.

      § 201.67   Maximum freight charges.

#### § § 201.67

      (a) —(1)  means shipments which are similar with respect to type of commodity, commodity rate classification, quantity, vessel flag category (U.S.-or foreign-flag), choice of ports, and other pertinent factors. In determining whether shipments are similar, no effect shall be given to the identity of the shipper or the circumstance that the shipment is or is not financed by the Government of the United States.

      (2)  (i) USAID will not finance ocean freight under any charter which has not been submitted to and received prior approval by USAID/W. USAID will not approve a charter if the freight rate exceeds:

      (A) The rate prevailing for similar shipments; or

      (B) The lowest rate charged by the vessel for similar shipments on the same voyage.

      (ii) In determining the rate prevailing for similar shipments, recognized sources of charter market rate information will be consulted and, if necessary, will be supplemented by other information which contributes to a realistic determination of the prevailing charter rate.

      (3)  USAID prior approval of a charter shall be confirmed by USAID in writing and shall then be final except in cases where the freight rate exceeds the lowest rate charged by the vessel for similar shipments on the same voyage or where USAID's prior approval is based on false or misleading representations made to USAID by the charterer or vessel owner(s).

      (4)  USAID will not finance ocean freight for a cargo liner shipment at a rate which exceeds the lowest of the following:

      (i) The conference contract rate or the conference noncontract rate, whichever is lower;

      (ii) The rate named in any tariff or other rate listing for the same destination and commodities on file at the Federal Maritime Commission; or

      (iii) The lowest rate charged by the VOCC for similar shipments on the same voyage.

      (5)  (i) The borrower/grantee, or the supplier with respect to despatch earned by the supplier, shall be responsible for refunding to USAID all despatch earned:

      (A) At the port of unloading on c.i.f. or c. & f. shipments, or

      (B) At the port of loading or unloading on f.o.b. or f.a.s. shipments, to the extent that despatch exceeds demurrage incurred on the same voyage.

      (ii) Refunds of despatch, supported by the vessel's signed laytime statement(s), must be transmitted to the Office of Financial Management, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7702, within 90 days after date of discharge of cargo on which the despatch was earned.

      (b)  USAID will not finance airfreight which exceeds the following:

      (2)  The documents submitted in connection with the claim for reimbursement on commodities may not indicate that the source of the commodities is inconsistent with the USAID geographic code designation contained in the letter of commitment.

      (3)  The documents submitted shall indicate that the destination of the commodities, by shipment, transshipment, or reshipment, is the cooperating country named in the letter of commitment.

      (4)  The documents shall describe and identify the commodities or services in a manner which, according to good commercial practice, is not inconsistent with the description contained in the letter of credit or payment instructions issued under a letter of commitment. The bank shall not be required to determine whether the supplier's invoice meets the detailed requirements of § 201.52(a)(2)(i).

      (5)  If the documents disclose that the invoice price includes either discounts or commissions payable to purchasing agents, the bank shall not make payment of such discounts and commissions. In the absence of such information, however, the bank shall not be required to make independent inquiry as to whether the invoice price includes such items.

      (6)  Each supplier's invoice presented for payment shall contain such other certifications as may be required in the letter of commitment. The bank shall accept only certifications which, to the best of its knowledge and belief, have been signed by hand.

      (7)  The documents submitted shall contain such other information as required by the letter of commitment, except that the bank shall have responsibility in this regard only to the extent specifically indicated in the letter of commitment.

      (c)  A bank shall not accept for submission to USAID the original of the Supplier's Certificate, or the Commodity Approval Application, unless, to the best knowledge and belief of the bank, each such original has been signed by hand by the supplier and the Commodity Approval Application has been countersigned by USAID.

      § 201.73   Limitations on the responsibilities of banks.

#### § § 201.73

      The following general limitations on the responsibilities of banks issuing, advising, or confirming letters of credit and making payments under letters of credit or otherwise shall apply.

      (a)  Any document, including the Supplier's Certificate and the Commodity Approval Application, submitted by a bank to USAID in support of a claim for reimbursement, shall be sufficient if it purports to be the sort required to be delivered and if it has been accepted by the bank in the ordinary course of business in good faith. Except as may be required in the discharge of its responsibilities under § 201.72 (b) and (c), the bank's right of reimbursement shall not be affected by the fact that any document required to be submitted by it is incomplete or may indicate noncompliance with any provision of this part.

      (b)  A bank's right to reimbursement from USAID for payments which the bank has made will not be affected by the fact that the Commodity Approval Application or the Invoice-and-Contract Abstract on the reverse of the Supplier's Certificate may be incomplete, or may indicate noncompliance with any provision of this part 201, the letter of commitment, or any other implementing document, or may be inconsistent with other documents required for reimbursement.

      (c)  The bank shall not be responsible for the truth or accuracy of any information or statement contained in any Supplier's Certificate or any other document certification to be submitted by it to USAID, notwithstanding any knowledge or information in the actual or constructive possession of the bank to the contrary. The bank shall not be obligated to look beyond the documents, including any certifications endorsed thereon, to be submitted by it or to make any independent investigation as to the truth or accuracy of any information or statement contained therein.

      (d)  Acceptance by the bank of any document in the ordinary course of business in good faith as being a genuine and valid document and sufficient in the premises, and the delivery thereof to USAID, shall constitute full compliance by the bank with any provision of this part, the letter of commitment requiring delivery of a document of the sort that the document actually so delivered purports to be. The bank shall be entitled to receive and retain reimbursement of the amount of all payments made by it against documents so accepted, notwithstanding that such payments may be made in connection with a purchase in excess of the price calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions of subpart G.

      (e)  The bank's right of reimbursement shall not be affected by the fact that payment is made to the approved applicant or at the request of the approved applicant or such beneficiary to a person other than the supplier under the contract to which such payment relates, if the bank has complied with all other requirements of the letter of commitment and has satisfied itself in good faith that the person to whom it makes payment has, in turn, made payment to the supplier.

      (f)  In the event a bank receives written advice from USAID concerning special conditions which are applicable to transactions of particular suppliers, such bank will use reasonable care to maintain procedures designed to ensure that accommodations thereafter furnished by it with respect to such suppliers by means of the issuance, confirmation, advising or transfer of letters of credit, or the making of payments not under letters of credit shall reflect such special conditions. While banks are expected to comply with the foregoing obligation, a bank which has used reasonable care to establish and maintain such procedures will not be responsible for any inadvertent furnishing of any such accommodation not containing applicable special conditions or the making of payment thereunder. For the purpose of ascertaining whether the supplier is a person or organization subject to an USAID advice concerning special conditions applicable to its transactions under this paragraph, a bank, in making payment under a letter of credit or otherwise, may consider as supplier the person or organization issuing the invoice.

      (g)  A bank shall not be responsible for compliance with any provision of an implementing document other than a letter of commitment.

      § 201.74   Additional documents for USAID.

#### § § 201.74

      In addition to the documents required for reimbursement, a bank shall retain in its files for a period of at least 3 years and shall make available to USAID promptly upon request a copy of any of the following documents which may pertain to an USAID-financed transaction:

      (a) Each letter of credit issued, confirmed, or advised by it, together with any extension or modification thereof;

      (b) Payment instructions received from the approved applicant;

      (c) Each application and agreement relating to such letter of credit or instructions for payment, together with any extension or modification thereof;

      (d) A detailed advice of the interest, commissions, expenses, or other items charged by it in connection with each such letter of credit or payment instructions.

      § 201.75   Termination or modification.

#### § § 201.75

      If USAID directs that the delivery of commodities be terminated, orders that title to commodities be vested in it, or modifies any implementing document concerning the disposition of documents, USAID shall give written notice thereof to the banks holding applicable letters of commitment and shall instruct each bank with regard to the disposition of documents. Each such bank shall be relieved of any liability whatsoever to the approved applicant for anything done or omitted to be done under instruction of USAID. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a bank shall comply with the instructions of USAID only to the extent that it may do so without impairing or affecting any irrevocable obligation to any person or organization except an approved applicant, and in the event the bank shall incur any costs, expenses, or liabilities, including any liability to the approved applicant, it shall be repaid and reimbursed by USAID in respect thereof.

    Subpart I—Rights and Remedies of USAID, and Waiver Authority

      § 201.80   Purpose.

#### § § 201.80

      This subpart sets forth certain USAID rights and remedies against borrower/grantees and suppliers, and prescribes certain general provisions relating to the waiver by USAID of this part.

      § 201.81   Rights of USAID against borrower/grantees.

#### § § 201.81

      If any transaction financed hereunder violates the requirements of this part or any U.S. statute or any rule or regulation of USAID promulgated under any such statute, USAID may require the borrower/grantee to refund the amounts USAID determines are attributable to such violation and may exercise any right of acceleration or termination contained in the implementing document. The borrower/grantee shall be deemed to have agreed to make such refund or accelerated payment promptly upon request by USAID and shall be deemed to have consented to any modification of the implementing document determined by USAID to be necessary to reflect any such refund or acceleration.

      § 201.82   Rights of USAID against suppliers.

#### § § 201.82

      Without limiting the responsibility of the borrower/grantee or other parties, USAID may require an appropriate refund to it by a supplier under any transaction which violates the requirements of this part, whenever in USAID's opinion the failure of the supplier to comply with the rules and other requirements of this part has contributed to such violation. Any refund requested will include interest from the time of payment to the supplier. Interest will be charged at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6621(b).

      § 201.83   No waiver of alternative rights or remedies by USAID.

#### § § 201.83

      No right reserved to USAID in this subpart to seek a refund from a borrower/grantee, and no exercise of such right, whether or not successful, shall in any way limit or affect, under the doctrine of the election of remedies or otherwise, USAID's rights against a supplier under this subpart I or under the laws of the United States, or of any other country or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any right or remedy herein reserved to USAID against a supplier in any way derogate from or otherwise limit any other rights or remedies which may accrue to USAID under such laws.

      § 201.84   Limitation on period for making refund requests.

#### § § 201.84

      USAID will endeavor, but shall not be bound, to make any requests for refunds from a borrower/grantee within three years from the date of the last disbursement of USAID funds for the transaction to which such request relates.

      § 201.85   Legal effect of USAID approvals and decisions.

#### § § 201.85

      In any transaction subject to this part 201, USAID may reserve certain rights to approve the transaction for USAID-financing. USAID, in reserving any approval rights, acts solely as a financing entity to assure the proper use of United States Government funds. Any decision by USAID to exercise or refrain from exercising these approval rights shall be made as a financier and shall not be construed as making USAID a party to the contract or incurring any liability to the parties jointly or to any of them.

      § 201.86   Waiver and amendment authority.

#### § § 201.86

      USAID may waive, withdraw, or amend at any time any or all of the provisions of this part.

  PART 205—PARTICIPATION BY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN USAID PROGRAMS

### Part 205

**Authority:** Authority: 22 U.S.C. 2381(a).

    § 205.1   Grants and cooperative agreements.

#### § § 205.1

    (a) As used in this section, the term “award” has the definition in 2 CFR 700.1 and the term “Federal financial assistance” has the definition in Executive Order 13279 (signed by President Bush on December 12, 2002). As used in this section, the following terms have the definitions in 2 CFR 200.1: “pass-through entity,” “recipient,” “subaward,” and “subrecipient” as modified by 2 CFR 700.3 to apply to both nonprofit and for-profit entities.

    (b) Faith-based organizations are eligible on the same basis as any other organization to receive any U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) award for which they are otherwise eligible. In the selection of recipients by USAID and subrecipients by pass-through entities, neither USAID nor pass-through entities shall discriminate for, or against, an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization. Notices or announcements of award opportunities shall include language to indicate that faith-based organizations are eligible on the same basis as any other organization and subject to the protections and requirements of Federal law.

    (c) Nothing in this part shall be construed to preclude USAID from making an accommodation, including for religious exercise, with respect to one or more award requirements on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States.

    (d) USAID shall not disqualify an organization from participating in any USAID award for which it is eligible on the basis of the organization's indication that it may request an accommodation with respect to one or more award requirements, unless the organization has made clear that the accommodation is necessary to its participation and USAID has determined that it would deny the accommodation.

    (e) Organizations that receive direct Federal financial assistance from USAID under any USAID award or subaward may not engage in explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) as part of the programs or services directly funded with direct Federal financial assistance from USAID. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded with direct Federal financial assistance from USAID, and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services funded with such assistance. Nothing in this part restricts USAID's authority under applicable Federal law to fund activities, such as the provision of chaplaincy services, that can be directly funded by the Government consistent with the Establishment Clause.

    (f) A faith-based organization that applies for, or participates in, USAID-funded awards or subawards will retain its autonomy, religious character, and independence, and may continue to carry out its mission consistent with religious freedom protections in Federal law, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct Federal financial assistance from USAID to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), or in any other manner prohibited by law. Among other things, a faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from USAID may use space in its facilities, without concealing, altering, or removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from USAID retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statement and other governing documents.

    (g) USAID must implement its awards in accordance with the Establishment Clause. Nothing in this part shall be construed as authorizing the use of USAID funds for activities that are not permitted by Establishment Clause jurisprudence or otherwise by law. USAID will consult with the U.S. Department of Justice if, in implementing a specific program involving overseas acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of structures used for explicitly religious activities, there is any question about whether such funding is consistent with the Establishment Clause. USAID will describe any program implemented after such consultation on its website.

    (h) An organization that receives a USAID-funded award or subaward shall not, in providing services or outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or potential program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.

    (i) No grant document, contract, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation used by USAID shall require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices where the Agency does not require them of secular organizations. Any restrictions on the use of award or subaward funds shall apply equally to faith-based and secular organizations. All organizations that receive USAID awards and subawards, including faith-based organizations, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all award requirements and other applicable requirements that govern the conduct of USAID-funded activities, including those that prohibit the use of direct Federal financial assistance from USAID to engage in explicitly religious activities. No grant document, contract, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation used by USAID shall disqualify faith-based organizations from receiving USAID awards on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof.

    (j) A religious organization does not forfeit its exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, when the organization receives Federal financial assistance from USAID.

    (k) If a USAID award requires an organization to be a “nonprofit organization” in order to be eligible for funding, the individual solicitation will specifically indicate the requirement for nonprofit status in the eligibility section of the solicitation. Potential applicants should consult with the appropriate USAID program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In USAID awards in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit organization, other than programs which are limited to registered Private and Voluntary Organizations, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:

    (1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;

    (2) A statement from a state taxing body or the State secretary of state certifying that:

    (i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within the State; and

    (ii) No part of its net earnings may lawfully benefit any private shareholder or individual;

    (3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the applicant; or

    (4) Any item described in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, together with a statement by the State or national parent organization that the applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.

    (l) Decisions about awards of USAID Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief, or lack thereof.

    (m) Nothing in this part shall be construed as authorizing the use of USAID funds for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of religious structures inside the United States.

    (n) The Secretary of State may waive the requirements of this section in whole or in part, on a case-by-case basis, where the Secretary determines that such waiver is necessary to further the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.

    (o) Nothing in this section shall be construed in such a way as to advantage, or disadvantage, faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

    § 209.5   Assurance required.

#### § § 209.5

    (a)  (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The head of the bureau or office administering the Federal financial assistance shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.

    (2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired withFederal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved withFederal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Agency to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Agency official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposed to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Administrator may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

    (3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).

    (b)  (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for a special training project, for student assistance, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.

    (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.

    § 209.6   Compliance information.

#### § § 209.6

    (a)  The Administrator shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

    (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the Administrator timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the Administrator may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

    (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by the Administrator during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

    (d)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the Administrator finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

    § 209.7   Conduct of investigations.

#### § § 209.7

    (a)  The Administrator shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.

    (b)  Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the Administrator a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Administrator.

    (c)  The Administrator will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.

    (d)  (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the Administrator will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 209.8.

    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the Administrator will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

    (e)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainant shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

    § 209.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 209.8

    (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

    (b)  If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 209.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Agency for International Development shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Agency shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.

    (c)  No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the head of the bureau or office administering the Federal financial assistance has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e) of § 209.10 and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Administrator has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

    (d)  No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be approprie.

    § 209.9   Hearings.

#### § § 209.9

    (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 209.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Administrator that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this section or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 209.8(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

    (b)  Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Agency for International Development in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the Administrator unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Agency requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the Administrator or before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act).

    (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient, and the Agency for International Development shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

    (d)  (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Agency for International Development and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

    (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Administrator may, by agreements with such other department or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 209.10.

> [30 FR 317, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17949, July 5, 1973]

    § 209.10   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 209.10

    (a)  If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Administrator for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and the complainant. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the Administrator his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Administrator may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the Administrator shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. The decision of the Administrator shall be mailed promptly to the applicant or recipient and the complainant, if any. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the Administrator.

    (b)  Wherever a record is certified to the Administrator for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the Administrator conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Administrator shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and the complainant, if any.

    (c)  Wherever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 209.9(a) a decision shall be made by the Administrator on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

    (d)  Each decision of a hearing officer or the Administrator shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

    (e)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Administrator that it will fully comply with this part.

    (f)  (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.

    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section may at any time request the responsible Agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the responsible Agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.

    (3) If the responsible Agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (e) of this section shall remain in effect.

    § 209.12   Effect on other regulations; supervision and coordination.

#### § § 209.12

    (a) All regulations, orders or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Agency for International Development which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendment thereof): (1) Executive Order 11246, and regulations issued thereunder, or (2) any other regulation or instruction insofar as it prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibits discrimination on any other ground.

    (b)  The Administrator may from time to time assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the government (with the consent of such department or agency) responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 209.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Agency for International Development and within the Executive branch of the Government in the application of title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations.

    Responsibility for administration and enforcement of this part, with respect to Federal financial assistance administered by another Federal department or agency pursuant to delegation, transfer interagency service agreement, or other arrangement is vested in the head of such department or agency, or his delegate, and subject to such delegations or redelegations as he may make or authorize.

  PART 211—TRANSFER OF FOOD COMMODITIES FOR FOOD USE IN DISASTER RELIEF, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ASSISTANCE

### Part 211

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1726a(c).

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 19766, May 7, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

    § 211.1   General purpose and scope; legislation.

#### § § 211.1

    (a)  The Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (Pub. L. 480), was further revised by the Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1990, Public Law 101-624, 104 Stat. 3632-65 (1990). The legislation implemented by the regulation in this part (as of the date of issuance of this part) includes sections of Public Law 480, as follows: Sections 1, 2, 3, 201, 202, 203, 207, 401, 402, 403, 404, 406, 407, 408, 409, 413 and 414. Pursuant to title II of Public Law 480, A.I.D. may transfer agricultural commodities to address famine or other urgent or extraordinary relief requirements; combat malnutrition, especially in children and mothers; carry out activities that attempt to alleviate the causes of hunger, mortality and morbidity; promote economic and community development; promote sound environmental practices; and carry out feeding programs. Agricultural commodities may be provided to meet emergency food needs through foreign governments and private or public organizations, including intergovernmental organizations. Section 202(a) of Public Law 480 authorizes A.I.D., notwithstanding any other provision of law, to provide agricultural commodities for emergency food needs in such manner and on such terms and conditions as A.I.D. determines appropriate to respond to the emergency. Agricultural commodities also may be provided for non-emergency assistance through private voluntary organizations or cooperatives which are, to the extent practicable, registered with A.I.D., and through intergovernmental organizations.

    (b)  This part 211, also known as A.I.D. Regulation 11, provides the standard terms and conditions applicable to title II programs, except those conducted by agencies of the United Nations and the World Food Program. The Operational Plan submitted by a cooperating sponsor may propose, and justify, the waiver of any section of this Regulation that is not required by statute. If A.I.D. approves a waiver, the specific section or subsection waived will be identified in the Transfer Authorization signed by the cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. or in an attachment, prepared by A.I.D., that is appended to the Operational Plan.

    § 211.2   Definitions.

#### § § 211.2

    (b)  or  (Form A.I.D. 1550-3, Exhibit E, A.I.D. Handbook 9) is a statistical update of the Operational Plan which is signed by the cooperating sponsor requesting commodities under title II estimating the quantities required. When signed by AID/W, the _AER_ together with the Food for Peace Program Agreement between A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor, the approved Operational Plan, and this Regulation 11 form a donation agreement between A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor with respect to the commodities included in the AER.

    (c)  means the Commodity Credit Corporation, a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (d)(1)  means an entity, within or without the United States, governmental or not, such as the foreign government, the American Red Cross, the intergovernmental organization, or the private voluntary organization or cooperative, which enters into an agreement with the U.S. Government for the use of agricultural commodities or funds.

    (2)  means a foreign government which has signed a Transfer Authorization under which agricultural commodities are donated for emergency purposes only. _Governmental cooperating sponsor_s are treated here as a group separate from other cooperating sponsors since they are eligible only for emergency programs and their circumstances are different in such matters as rules governing shipping and in certain other aspects of agreements.

    (3)  means a cooperating sponsor which is a private voluntary organization, a cooperative, the American Red Cross, or other private or public agency. An intergovernmental organization also is treated as a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor in this Regulation 11 unless the text or context indicates otherwise.

    (e)  means a private sector organization whose members own and control the organization and share in its services and its profits and that provides business services and outreach in cooperative development for its membership.

    (f)  means the offices of the Department of State located in foreign countries and may include Embassies, Legations, and Consular offices. Since A.I.D. is responsible for title II programs, references in this Regulation to _Diplomatic Posts_ apply only with respect to those countries where there is no USAID.

    (g)  means organizations which are authorized by AID/W, USAID or a Diplomatic Post to assist disaster victims.

    (h)  means persons who, because of flood, drought, fire, earthquake, other natural or man-made disasters, or extraordinary relief requirements, are in need of food, feed, or other assistance.

    (i)  means exempt from all customs duties, toll charges, taxes or governmental impositions levied on the act of importation.

    (j)(1)  establishes a nongovernmental organization as a cooperating sponsor for which A.I.D. agrees to authorize future transfers of commodities in accordance with title II of Public Law 480 and Regulation 11 and the cooperating sponsor agrees to accept transfer of commodities in accordance with approved programs under title II and A.I.D. Regulation 11 and related procedures.

    (2)  means an agreement between the cooperating sponsor and the foreign government of each cooperating country which authorizes the cooperating sponsor to conduct activities there in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions set forth within this Regulation 11.

    (3)  means a written agreement between the cooperating sponsor and a recipient agency prior to the transfer to the recipient agency of commodities, monetized proceeds, or other program income for distribution or implementation of an approved program.

    (k)  (f.a.s.) includes all costs of transportation and delivery of the goods to the dock. “Free on board” (f.o.b.) includes costs for delivering the goods and loading them aboard the carrier at a specific location.

    (l)  means nonpenal, public or nonprofit private establishments that operate for charitable or welfare purposes where needy persons reside and receive meals including, but not limited to, homes for the aged, mentally and physically handicapped, refugee camps, and leprosy asylums.

    (m)  means agencies sponsored and supported by two or more nations, one of which is the United States.

    (n)  means the compensation made to those by whose assistance a vessel or its cargo has been saved from impending peril or recovered from actual loss.

    (o)  means funds generated from the sale of title II commodities in approved monetization programs. _Monetized proceeds_ should be deposited in a special interest-bearing account for control and monitoring.

    (p)  means that the residue of income over operating expenses accruing in any activity, project, or program is used solely for the operation of such activity, project, or program.

    (q)  is a plan submitted by the cooperating sponsor or potential cooperating sponsor describing the proposed use of commodity and/or monetized proceeds and/or program income. All references in this Regulation to the _Operational Plan_ shall include the AER that relates to such Operational Plan.

    (r)  means a not-for-profit, nongovernmental organization (in the case of a United States organization, an organization that is exempt from Federal Income Taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) that receives funds from private sources, voluntary contributions of money, staff time, or in-kind support from the public, and that is engaged or is planning to engage in voluntary, charitable or development assistance activities (other than religious activities).

    (s)  means gross income earned by the cooperating sponsor or recipient agencies from activities supported under the approved program during the program period, including, but not limited to, interest earned on deposits of monetized proceeds, revenue from income generating activities, funds accruing from the sale of containers and nominal voluntary contributions by recipients made on the basis of ability to pay.

    (t)  means schools, institutions, welfare agencies, disaster relief organizations, and public or private agencies whose food distribution functions or project activities are sponsored by the cooperating sponsor and which receive for distribution to eligible recipients commodities or monetized proceeds or program income for approved project activities. A cooperating sponsor may be a recipient agency.

    (u)  means persons who receive food assistance or the benefit of monetized proceeds or program income because of their economic or nutritional condition or who are otherwise eligible to receive commodities for their own use or other assistance in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved Operational Plan or Transfer Authorization.

    (v)  means a nonprofit private voluntary organization or cooperative registered with, and approved by, A.I.D. The term includes foreign as well as U.S. registered nonprofit voluntary organizations and cooperatives. For discussion of registration, see 22 CFR part 203, A.I.D. Regulation 3, Registration of Agencies for Voluntary Foreign Aid. In reviewing and approving proposals, A.I.D., at its discretion, may give preference to registered private voluntary organizations and cooperatives over those that are not and to U.S. private voluntary organizations and cooperatives over those that are foreign.

    (w)  or  means the document signed by the cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. which describes commodities and the program in which they will be used. The _TA_ incorporates A.I.D. Regulation 11 and authorizes CCC to ship the commodities.

    (x)  means the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (y)  means public or private voluntary organizations that provide care, including food assistance, to needy persons who are not residents of institutions.

    § 211.3   Cooperating sponsor agreements; program procedure.

#### § § 211.3

    (a)  A nongovernmental organization is eligible to be a cooperating sponsor for regular programs under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section only after it has entered into a Food For Peace Program Agreement with A.I.D. that incorporates the terms and conditions set forth in Regulation 11.

    (b)  Nongovernmental and intergovernmental cooperating sponsors shall, in addition to the Food for Peace Program Agreement, enter into a separate written Host Country Food for Peace Agreement with the foreign government of each country for which title II commodities are transferred to the cooperating sponsor. This agreement shall establish the terms and conditions needed by a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to conduct a title II program in the country in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part. The cooperating sponsor shall provide USAID or the Diplomatic Post a copy of each executed Host Country Food for Peace Agreement.

    Where such written agreement is not appropriate or feasible, USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall assure AID/W, in writing, that the program can be effectively implemented in compliance with this Regulation without such an agreement.

    (c)  Prior to the transfer of commodities, monetized proceeds, or program income to a recipient agency for distribution or implementation of an approved program, the cooperating sponsor shall execute with such agency a written agreement which shall:

    (1) Describe the approved uses of commodities, monetized proceeds and program income in a manner consistent with the approved Operational Plan or TA;

    (2) Require the recipient agency to pay the cooperating sponsor the value of any commodities, monetized proceeds or program income that are used for purposes not permitted under the Recipient Agency Agreement or that are lost, damaged or misused as a result of the recipient agency's failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to such commodities, monetized proceeds or program income; and

    (3) Incorporate by reference or otherwise the terms and conditions set forth in this Regulation 11.

    (d) —(1)  A program may be requested by any cooperating sponsor, including private voluntary organizations, cooperatives, foreign governments (for emergencies only), and international organizations.

    (2)  There are two basic patterns of decision typically employed in approving a request for title II assistance:

    (i)  The cooperating sponsor submits to A.I.D. an Operational Plan or multi-year Operational Plan (see appendix I), describing the program proposed. Also, an AER will be submitted to A.I.D. along with the Operational Plan, estimating the quantities of commodities required for each program proposed. AID/W's approval of and signature on the AER completes this decision process.

    (ii)  The other basic pattern of decision making results in a Transfer Authorization. The TA is used for all emergency government-to-government programs, and for nongovernmental cooperating sponsor programs which do not fit within the Program Agreement/AER framework. The TA will include by reference Regulation 11.

    (3)  A.I.D.'s agreement to transfer commodities is subject to the availability of appropriations and agricultural commodities during each United States Government fiscal year to which it applies.

    (4)  Under Public Law 480, section 207(a), within 45 days of its submission to AID/W, a decision must be made on a proposal submitted by a private voluntary organization or cooperative, concurred in by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. The decision shall detail the reasons for approval or denial, and if denied, conditions to be met for approval. In addition, a USAID or Diplomatic Post must decide whether or not to concur in the proposal within 45 days of receiving it or provide a written explanation to the private voluntary organization or cooperative and AID/W of the reasons USAID or the Diplomatic Post needs more time to consider the proposal.

    § 211.4   Availability and shipment of commodities.

#### § § 211.4

    (a)  Commodities shall be available for shipment, distribution and use in accordance with the provisions of the approved Operational Plan and AER, or TA and this Regulation 11.

    (b)  (1) Unless the approved Operational Plan or TA provides otherwise, title to the commodity shall pass—

    (i) For nongovernmental cooperating sponsors, at the point in the United States at which the ocean carrier or its agents take possession of the cargo (generally f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel U.S. port); or

    (ii) For governmental cooperating sponsors, at the destination port of entry, upon completion of discharge by the ocean carrier (non-landlocked countries), or at the destination point of entry, upon completion of delivery by the inland carrier (landlocked countries).

    (2) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall make the necessary arrangements to accept commodities at the points of availability designated by CCC.

    (c)  (1) Except as othervise provided in the Operational Plan or TA, the United States will pay in accordance with this paragraph (c) processing, handling, transportation, and other incidental costs incurred in making commodities available to cooperating sponsors at U.S. ports or U.S. inland destinations, up to the point at which the ocean carrier takes possession of the cargo.

    (2) The United States will finance the transfer of commodities at the lowest combination inland and ocean transportation costs as determined by the United States and in sizes and types of packages announced as applicable. If a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor requests changes to these standards which are made by the United States as an accommodation to the cooperating sponsor and these changes result in costs over those the United States otherwise would have incurred, the cooperating sponsor shall reimburse the United States for these increased costs promptly upon request.

    (3) All costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the transfer of title to cooperating sponsors shall be borne by them except as otherwise provided herein. Upon the determination that it is in the interests of the program to do so, the United States may pay or reimburse the following additional costs:

    (i) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to the designated ports of entry abroad; or

    (ii) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to designated points of entry abroad in the case—

    (A) Of landlocked countries,

    (B) Where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances,

    (C) Where carriers to a specific country are unavailable, or

    (D) Where a substantial savings in cost or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports; or

    (iii) In the case of commodities for urgent and extraordinary relief requirements, including prepositioned commodities, transportation costs from designated points of entry or ports of entry abroad to storage and distribution centers and associated storage and distribution costs.

    (d)  When A.I.D. contracts for ocean carriage, carriers shall be paid by A.I.D., as provided in their contracts of affreightment, upon presentation of Standard Form 1034 and three copies of 1034A (Public Voucher for purchases and services other than personal), together with three copies of the related on-board ocean bill of lading, one copy of which must contain the following certification signed by an authorized representative of the steamship company:

    (e) —(1)  Requests for shipment of commodities shall originate with the cooperating sponsor and shall be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for clearance and transmittal to AID/W. AID/W shall, through cables or letters to USAID or the Diplomatic Post, provide cooperating sponsors (and, where applicable, private voluntary organization or cooperative headquarters) with names of vessels, expected times of arrival (ETAs), and other pertinent information on shipments booked by A.I.D. As soon as possible but not later than 7 days from the time of exportation of commodities, A.I.D.'s freight forwarding contractor shall send applicable ocean bills of lading by airmail, or by the fastest means available, to USDA (Chief, Processed Commodities Division, Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205), to USAID or the Diplomatic Post (and where applicable to the USAID Controller and nongovernmental cooperating sponsor headquarters and field representative), to AID/W, FA/OP/TRANS (see § 211.4(d)), and to the consignee in sufficient time to advise of the arrival of the shipment.

    (2)  Requests for shipment of commodities shall originate with the cooperating sponsor and shall be cleared by USAID or the Diplomatic Post before transmittal to the cooperating sponsor's headquarters for concurrence and issuance. USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall promptly clear such requests for shipment of commodities or, if there is reason for delay or disapproval, advise the cooperating sponsor and AID/W within seven (7) days of receipt of requests for shipment. After the cooperating sponsor headquarters concurs in the request and issues the order, the original will be sent promptly to AID/W which will forward it to CCC for procurement action with a copy to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Headquarters of cooperating sponsors which book their own shipments shall provide their representatives and USAID or the Diplomatic Post with the names of vessels, ETAs and other pertinent information on shipments booked. At the time of exportation of commodities, the booking agent representing the cooperating sponsor shall send applicable ocean bills of lading by airmail or by the fastest means available to USDA (Chief, Processed Commodities Division, Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205), to USAID or the Diplomatic Post (and where applicable to the USAID Controller and the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor representative), to AID/W, FA/OP/TRANS (see § 211.4(d)), and to the consignee in the country of destination in sufficient time to advise of the arrival of the shipment. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors also will forward cable advice of actual exportation to their program directors in countries within the Caribbean area in view of the short transit time from U.S. port to destination.

    (3) Cooperating sponsors awarding USAID-financed ocean transportation bookings of food aid under the Public Law 480, title II program shall follow consistent, transparent, fair and effective procedures. In order to promote these objectives, USAID may formulate, and from time-to-time amend, uniform standard booking guidelines relating to such bookings. Guidelines will be finalized only after consultation with affected cooperating sponsors, freight forwarders and carriers as required by the Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1990 or other applicable legislation. Copies of the guidelines and any proposed amendments may be obtained from the Transportation Division, Office of Procurement, Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523.

    (f)  Delivery by the United States to the cooperating sponsor at point of transfer of title within a tolerance of 5 percent (2 percent in the case of quantities over 10,000 metric tons) plus or minus, of the quantity ordered for shipment shall be regarded as completion of delivery. There shall be no tolerance with respect to the ocean carrier's responsibility to deliver the entire cargo shipped and the United States assumes no obligation for failure by an ocean carrier to complete delivery to port of discharge.

    (g)  (1) Pursuant to section 407(c)(4) of Public Law 480, a person may not be an agent, broker, consultant, or other representative of the U.S. Government, an importer, or an importing country in connection with agricultural commodities provided under Public Law 480 during a fiscal year in which such person acts as an agent, broker, consultant or other representative of a person engaged in providing ocean transportation or ocean transportation-related services for such commodities.

    (i) For purposes of section 407(c)(4), the term “transportation-related services” means lightening, stevedoring, bagging or inland transportation to the destination point.

    (ii) The prohibition does not preclude payment by ocean carriers of compensation or brokerage fees on a shipment-by-shipment basis as provided in governing tariffs or charter parties to persons performing freight forwarding or charter broking services under contract to the U.S. Government.

    (2) Pursuant to section 407(d)(3) of Public Law 480, freight agents employed by A.I.D. under title I, II or III of Public Law 480 shall not represent any other foreign government during the period of their contract with the United States Government. This restriction applies both to charter brokers and freight forwarders whether they are prime contractors or subcontractors of A.I.D.

    (3) This paragraph (g) does not apply to shipments booked by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors or their agents.

    § 211.5   Obligations of cooperating sponsor.

#### § § 211.5

    (a)  Each cooperating sponsor shall submit a description of the programs it is sponsoring or proposes to sponsor to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for its approval. AID/W will prescribe the format and timing for submittals and provide final approval of the Operational Plan. This Operational Plan will include program purposes and goals; criteria for measuring program effectiveness; a description of the activities for which commodities, monetized proceeds, or program income will be provided or used; and other specific provisions in addition to those set forth in this Regulation. Further, this description will include information from which it may be determined that the distribution of commodities in the recipient country will not result in a substantial disincentive to domestic production and that adequate storage facilities will be available in the recipient country at the time of arrival of the commodity to prevent spoilage or waste of the commodity. For preparation of the Operational Plan, see appendix I to this regulation. If a cooperating sponsor submits a multi-year Operational Plan that is approved by A.I.D., the Operational Plan provided with an AER each subsequent year should cover only those components or features which require updating or the cooperating sponsor proposes to change. A.I.D. will issue guidance each year regarding Operational Plans that must be submitted by cooperating sponsors. Within the limits of the total amount of commodities, monetized proceeds and program income approved by A.I.D. in the Operational Plan, the cooperating sponsor may increase or decrease by not to exceed 10 percent the amount of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income allocated to approved program categories or components of the Operational Plan. Such adjustments must be identified specifically in the annual report submitted by a cooperating sponsor under § 211.10(b) of the Regulation. A cooperating sponsor may not otherwise deviate from the Operational Plan without the prior written approval of A.I.D.

    (b)  Cooperating sponsors shall provide adequate supervisory personnel for the efficient operation of the program, including personnel to:

    (1) Plan, organize, implement, control, and evaluate programs involving distribution of commodities or use of monetized proceeds and program income,

    (2) Make warehouse inspections, physical inventories, and end-use checks of food or funds, and

    (3) Review of books and records maintained by recipient agencies that receive monetized proceeds and/or program income.

    (c) —(1)  A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall arrange for periodic audits to be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, including the OMB Compliance Supplement and the Statement of Position Regarding Circular A-133 developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Nongovernmental recipient agencies shall be treated as subrecipients under OMB Circular A-133, and governmental recipient agencies shall furnish the cooperating sponsor audits in accordance with the standard in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The cooperating sponsor may satisfy these audit responsibilities with respect to recipient agencies by relying on independent audits performed of recipient agencies or on appropriate procedures performed by the cooperating sponsor's internal audit or program staff, by expanding the scope of the independent financial and compliance audit of the cooperating sponsor to encompass testing of recipient agency charges, or by a combination of these procedures. The Generally Accepted Commodity Accounting Principles issued by Food Aid Management, an association of cooperating sponsors, may be used for commodity accounting.

    (2)  A governmental cooperating sponsor shall ensure that an audit satisfactory to A.I.D. is conducted annually with respect to donated commodities and monetized proceeds, if commodity sales are authorized under the agreement with A.I.D., including commodities and monetized proceeds transferred to or used by recipient agencies. The audit shall be a financial audit performed by the country's principal government audit agency or another audit agency or firm acceptable to A.I.D. This audit should be conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office, or auditing standards that have been prescribed by the laws of the country or adopted by public accountants or an association of public accountants in the country, or Auditing Standards promulgated by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions or International Auditing Practices Committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Both the auditor and the auditing standards to be used by the cooperating sponsor must be acceptable to A.I.D. The cooperating sponsor may satisfy its audit responsibility with respect to recipient agencies by relying on independent audits of the recipient agency or on appropriate procedures performed by internal audit or program staff of the cooperating sponsor, by expanding the scope of the independent financial audit of the cooperating sponsor to encompass testing of recipient agency charges or actions, or by a combination of these procedures. Recipient agencies that receive less than $25,000 of donated commodities and/or monetized proceeds are excluded from the cooperating sponsor's audit responsibility.

    (d)  Each cooperating sponsor shall submit to USAID or the Diplomatic Post, within such times and on the AER form prescribed by AID/W, estimates of requirements showing the quantities of commodities required for each program proposed.

    (e)  Except as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing, agricultural commodities donated by A.I.D. shall not be distributed, handled or allocated by any military forces.

    (f)  Cooperating sponsors shall be responsible for determining that the recipients and recipient agencies to whom they distribute commodities are eligible in accordance with the Operational Plan or TA and this Regulation. Cooperating sponsors shall impose upon recipient agencies responsibility for determining that the recipients to whom they distribute commodities or provide assistance with monetized proceeds or program income are eligible. Commodities shall be distributed free of charge except as provided in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section or as otherwise authorized by AID/W, but in no case will recipients be excluded from receiving commodities because of inability to make a contribution to the cooperating sponsor for any purpose.

    (g)  Cooperating sponsors shall distribute commodities to and conduct operations (with food, monetized proceeds, or program income) only with eligible recipient agencies and eligible recipients without regard to political affiliation, geographic location, ethnic, tribal or religious identity or other factors extraneous to need and the eligibility criteria set forth in the approved Operational Plan or TA, and shall impose similar conditions upon recipient agencies.

    (h)  To the maximum extent practicable, and with the cooperation of the host government, adequate public recognition shall be given in the press, by radio, and other media that the commodities or assistance financed by monetized proceeds or program income have been provided through the friendship of the American people as food for peace. At distribution and feeding centers or other project sites the cooperating sponsor shall, to the extent feasible, display banners, posters, or similar media which shall contain information similar to that prescribed for containers in paragraph (i) of this section. Recipients' individual identification cards shall, insofar as practicable, be imprinted to contain such information.

    (i) —(1)  Unless otherwise specified in the Operational Plan or TA, when commodities are packaged for shipment from the United States, bags and other containers shall be marked with the CCC contract number or other identification, the A.I.D. emblem and the following information stated in English:

    (i) Name of commodity;

    (ii) Provided through the friendship of the American people as food for peace;

    (iii) Not to be sold or exchanged (where applicable).

    (2)  Cooperating sponsors may dispose of containers, other than containers provided by carriers, in which commodities are received in countries having approved title II programs, by sale or exchange, or may distribute the containers free of charge to eligible food or fiber recipients for their personal use. If the containers are to be used commercially, the cooperating sponsor must arrange for the removal, obliteration, or cross out of the U.S. Government markings from the containers prior to such use.

    (j)  Provisions of this Regulation that prohibit or restrict the sale of commodities or require marking or labeling of containers do not apply to the extent the sale of commodities is approved by A.I.D. Cooperating sponsors are not required to monitor, manage, report on or account for the distribution or use of commodities after title to the commodities has passed to buyers or other third parties pursuant to a sale under a monetization program and all sales proceeds have been fully deposited in the special interest-bearing account established by the cooperating sponsor for monetized proceeds. However, the receipt and use of sales proceeds must be monitored, managed, reported and accounted for as provided in this Regulation, with special reference to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, and § 211.10. It is not mandatory that commodities approved for monetization be imported and sold free from all duties and taxes, but nongovernmental cooperating sponsors may negotiate agreements with the host government permitting the tax-free import and sale of such commodities. Even where the cooperating sponsor negotiates tax-exempt status, the prices at which the cooperating sponsor sells the commodities to the purchaser should reflect prices that would be obtained in a commercial transaction, , the prices would include the cost of duties and taxes, except as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing. Thus, the amounts normally paid for duties and taxes would accrue for the benefit of the cooperating sponsor's approved program. Cooperating sponsors should refer to the “Monetization Field Manual” for more comprehensive guidance on setting the sales price. A copy of the Monetization Manual may be obtained from AID/W-FHA/PPE, Washington, DC 20523.

    (k)  (1) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors and recipient agencies may use monetized proceeds and program income to:

    (i) Transport, store, distribute and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of donated commodities and products thereof, including construction or improvement of storage facilities or warehouses, handling, insect and rodent control, payment of personnel employed or used by the cooperating sponsor or recipient agencies in support of approved programs;

    (ii) Implement income generating, community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural and other developmental activities agreed upon by A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor;

    (iii) Make investments, with the approval of A.I.D., and any interest earned on such investments may be used for purposes described in paragraphs (k)(l) (i) and (ii) of this section;

    (iv) Improve their financial and other management systems; and

    (v) Pay indirect costs of the cooperating sponsor that are allocable to the monetization program at the indirect cost rate approved by A.I.D. for the cooperating sponsor, the direct and indirect costs of an office maintained by the cooperating sponsor in the country where the monetization program is conducted that are allocable to the title II program there, and the costs of a regional office maintained by a cooperating sponsor that are allocable to the cooperating sponsor's effort to enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities provided by A.I.D. under title II.

    (2) Monetized proceeds and program income may be used by the cooperating sponsor and recipient agencies only for the purposes described in the Operational Plan or TA, or otherwise approved by A.I.D., in writing, and only for such costs as would be allowable under OMB Circular A-122, as amended, “Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations”. A recipient agency may use not to exceed $500 per year of voluntary contributions for institutional, community or social development or other humanitarian purposes without regard to the Operational Plan or TA or OMB Circular A-122.

    (3) Governmental cooperating sponsors shall use monetized proceeds and program income only for emergency purposes as described in the TA with respect to such programs.

    (4) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.

    (5) Except as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing, monetized proceeds may not be used to finance the production for export of agricultural commodities, or products thereof, that would compete in the world market with similar agricultural commodities, or products thereof, produced in the United States, if such competition would cause substantial injury to the United States producers, as determined by A.I.D.

    (6)(i) The cooperating sponsor shall use commercially reasonable practices in construction activities and in purchasing goods and services with monetized proceeds or program income; maintain a code of standards of conduct regarding conflicts of interest; carry out procurement transactions in a manner to provide open and free competition to the maximum extent practicable; and maintain and make available to A.I.D. in accordance with § 211.10 records and documents regarding the procurement of goods and services with monetized proceeds and program income. Cooperating sponsors shall follow their own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds and payment bonds when program income or monetized proceeds are used to finance construction or the improvement of facilities, but shall consult with USAID or the Diplomatic Post regarding such requirements when the estimated cost of such construction or improvements exceeds $100,000. Title to real and personal property shall be vested in the cooperating sponsor, except as provided in the Operational Plan or TA or as A.I.D. may otherwise agree in writing, subject to the requirements of § 211.11 upon termination of the program.

    (ii) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to acquire, construct, alter or upgrade land, buildings or other real property improvements that are used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes or which are owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious activity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, monetized proceeds or program income may be used to finance repair or rehabilitation of an existing structure owned or managed by a church or organization engaged exclusively in religious activity to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated commodities, provided that the structure is not used in whole or in part for any sectarian purpose while donated commodities are stored in it. The use of monetized proceeds or program income to finance construction of such a structure may be approved in the Operational Plan or TA or by USAID or the Diplomatic Post if the structure is needed and will be used for the storage of donated commodities for a sufficient period of time to warrant the expenditure of monetized proceeds or program income and the structure will not be used for any sectarian purpose during this period.

    (l)  The cooperating sponsor (headquarters, if there is more than one office) shall annually provide AID/W a report on the receipt and disbursement of all monetized proceeds and program income by cooperating sponsors and recipient agencies. This report should include the source of the funds, by country, and how the funds were used. This annual report should be submitted to AID/W by December 31 of each calendar year for the fiscal year ending September 30 of that calendar year.

    (m)  Except in the case of emergency or disaster situations, the donation of commodities furnished for these programs shall not result in increased availability for export by the recipient country of the same or like commodities and shall not interfere with or displace sales in the recipient country which might otherwise take place. A country may be exempt from this proviso if circumstances warrant. USAIDs should seek AID/W guidance on this matter.

    (n)  After the date of the program approval by AID/W, but before arrival at the distribution point of the commodities authorized, the cooperating sponsor may, with prior approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post, borrow the same or similar commodities from available sources to meet program requirements provided that:

    (1) Borrowed commodities which are used in accordance with the terms of the Operational Plan or TA will be replaced with commodities transferred by A.I.D. The amount of commodities transferred to replace borrowed commodities shall be established by mutual agreement between the cooperating sponsor and USAID or the Diplomatic Post and will be determined on the basis of equivalent value at the time and place of transfer or on some other justifiable basis proposed by the cooperating sponsor and acceptable to USAID or the Diplomatic Post;

    (2) Packaged commodities which are borrowed shall be appropriately identified insofar as practicable in the language of the country of distribution as having been provided through the friendship of the American people as food for peace; and

    (3) Suitable publicity shall be given to the exchange of commodities as provided in paragraph (h) of this section and containers for borrowed commodities shall be marked to the extent practicable in accordance with § 211.6(c).

    (o)  After the date of program approval by AID/W, but before distribution of the commodities, USAID or the Diplomatic Post (or the cooperating sponsor with prior approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post) may transfer commodities between approved title II programs to meet emergency disaster requirements or to improve efficiency of operation, such as to meet temporary shortages due to delays in ocean transportation or provide for rapid distribution of stocks in danger of deterioration. Transfers also may be made to disaster organizations for use in meeting exceptional circumstances. Commodity transfers shall be made at no cost to the U.S. Government and with the concurrence of the cooperating sponsor and disaster relief organization concerned. A USAID or Diplomatic Post with funds available, however, may pay the costs of transfers to meet extraordinary relief requirements, and AID/W shall be advised promptly of the details of the transfer. Commodities transferred between programs shall not be replaced by the U.S. Government unless AID/W authorizes such replacement.

    (p)  If commodities are on hand which cannot be utilized in accordance with the approved Operational Plan or the TA, the cooperating sponsor shall promptly advise USAID or the Diplomatic Post of the quantities, location and condition of such commodities, and where possible, shall propose an alternate use of the excess stocks; USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall determine the most appropriate use of the excess stocks, and with prior AID/W concurrence, shall issue instructions for disposition. Transportation costs and other charges attributable to transferring commodities from one program to another within the country shall be the responsibility of the cooperating sponsor, except that in case of disaster or emergency, AID/W may authorize the use of disaster or emergency funds to pay for the costs of such transfers. (For discussion of unfit commodity disposal, see § 211.8.)

    (q)  The restrictions in this Regulation regarding the distribution, use or labeling of commodities shall not apply to commodities furnished by CCC in exchange for other commodities obtained from third parties (“exchanged commodities”) to be distributed in a recipient country under a trilateral exchange program. Except as A.I.D. and the cooperating sponsor may otherwise agree in writing, title to the exchanged commodities will pass to the cooperating sponsor upon delivery to and acceptance by the cooperating sponsor at the point of delivery specified in the Operational Plan or TA. After title passes to the cooperating sponsor the exchanged commodities shall be deemed “commodities” covered by this Regulation with respect to all post-delivery obligations of the cooperating sponsor contained in this Regulation, including obligations regarding labeling to the extent practicable, distribution, monitoring, reporting, accounting and use of commodities or monetized proceeds resulting from their sale. In the event of difficulty in satisfying the labeling requirement, the cooperating sponsor will consult with USAID or the Diplomatic Post for guidance.

    (r)  Governmental cooperating sponsors shall permit donated commodities to be discharged notwithstanding any dispute or question concerning quality, quantity, or other matters relating to the commodity itself. Any such dispute or question shall be resolved in accordance with procedures stated in this Regulation or in the relevant shipping or other contracts, as applicable.

    § 211.6   Processing, repackaging, and labeling commodities.

#### § § 211.6

    (a)  Cooperating sponsors or their designees may arrange for processing commodities into different end products and for packaging or repackaging commodities prior to distribution. Commodities may be bartered, or monetized proceeds or program income may be used, to offset such costs if provided for in the Operational Plan or TA or approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. When commercial facilities are used for processing, packaging or repackaging, cooperating sponsors or their designees shall enter into written agreements for such services and copies of the agreements must be provided to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Except as AID/W otherwise agrees, the executed agreements shall provide as a minimum that the party providing such services shall:

    (1) Fully account to the cooperating sponsor for all commodities delivered to the processor's possession and shall maintain adequate records and submit periodic reports pertaining to the performance of the agreement;

    (2) Be liable for the value of all commodities not accounted for as provided in § 211.9(e);

    (3) Return or dispose of the containers in which the commodity is received from the cooperating sponsor according to instructions from the cooperating sponsor; and

    (4) Plainly label carton, sacks, or other containers containing the end product in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

    (b)  When cooperating sponsors utilize their own facilities to process, package, or repackage commodities into different end products, and when such products are distributed for consumption off the premises of the cooperating sponsor, the cooperating sponsor shall plainly label the containers as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and banners, posters, or similar media which shall contain information similar to that prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be displayed at the distribution center. Recipients' individual identification cards shall to the maximum extent practicable be imprinted to contain such information.

    (c)  If, prior to distribution, the cooperating sponsor arranges for packaging or repackaging donated commodities, the cartons, sacks, or other containers in which the commodities are packed shall be plainly labeled with the A.I.D. emblem, and insofar as practicable, with the following information in the language of the country in which the commodities are to be distributed:

    (1) Name of commodity;

    (2) Provided through the friendship of the American people as food for peace; and

    (3) Not to be sold or exchanged (where applicable).

    (d)  When the usual practice in a country is not to enclose the end product in a container, wrapper, sack, etc., the cooperating sponsor shall, to the extent practicable, display banners, posters, or other media, and imprint on individual recipient identification cards information similar to that prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

    § 211.7   Arrangements for entry and handling in foreign country.

#### § § 211.7

    (a)  Except as otherwise agreed upon by AID/W and provided in the applicable shipping contract or in paragraph (d) and (e) of this section, the cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for all costs, other than those assessed by the delivering carrier either in accordance with its applicable tariff for delivery to the discharge port or the applicable charter or booking contract. The cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for all costs related to

    (1) Distributing the commodity to end users, as provided in the approved Operational Plan or TA;

    (2) Demurrage, detention, and overtime;

    (3) Obtaining independent discharge survey reports as provided in § 211.9 under which the cooperating sponsor will be reimbursed for the costs of obtaining independent survey reports as provided in § 211.9(c)(1)(iv); and

    (4) Wharfage, taxes, dues, and port charges assessed and collected by local authorities from the consignee, lighterage (when not a custom of the port), and lightening costs when assessed as a charge separate from the freight rate.

    (b)  Except for commodities which are to be monetized (sold) under an approved Operational Plan or TA, commodities shall be admitted duty free and exempt from all taxes. Consular or legalization invoices shall not be required unless specific provision is made in the Operational Plan or TA. If required, they shall be issued without cost to the cooperating sponsor or to the Government of the United States. The cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for ensuring prompt entry and transit in the foreign country(ies) and for obtaining all necessary import permits, licenses or other appropriate approvals for entry and transit, including phytosanitary, health and inspection certificates.

    (c)  The cooperating sponsors shall provide assurance to USAID or the Diplomatic Post that all necessary arrangements for receiving the commodities have been made, and shall assume full responsibility for storage and maintenance of the commodities from time of delivery at port of entry abroad or, when authorized, at other designated points of entry abroad agreed upon between the cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. Before recommending approval of a program to AID/W, USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall obtain, from the cooperating sponsor, assurance that provision has been made for internal transportation, and for storage and handling which are adequate by local commercial standards. The cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for the maintenance of the commodities in such manner as to assure distribution of the commodities in good condition to recipient agencies or eligible recipients.

    (d)  In the case of landlocked countries, transportation in the intermediate country to a designated inland point of entry in the recipient country shall be arranged by the cooperating sponsor unless otherwise provided in the Operational Plan or TA. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall handle claims arising from loss or damage in the intermediate country, in accordance with § 211.9(e). Governmental cooperating sponsors shall assign any rights that they may have to any claims that arise in the intermediate country to USAID or the Diplomatic Post which shall pursue and retain the proceeds of such claims.

    (e)  If, because of packaging damage, a cooperating sponsor determines that commodities must be repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution point in a wholesome condition, the cooperating sponsor may incur expenses for such repackaging up to $500 and such costs will be reimbursed by CCC. If costs will exceed $500, the authority to repackage and incur the costs must be approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post in advance of repackaging unless such prior approval is specifically waived, in writing, by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. For losses in transit, the $500 limitation shall apply to all commodities which are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port of destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier. For other losses, the $500 limitation shall apply to each loss situation, e.g., if 700 bags are damaged in a warehouse due to an earthquake, the $500 limitation applies to the total cost of repackaging the 700 bags. Shipments may not be artificially divided in order to avoid the limitation of $500 or for obtaining prior approval to incur repackaging costs.

    (f)  (1) Costs of repackaging required because of damage occurring prior to or during discharge from the ocean carrier should be included, as a separate item, in claims filed against the ocean carrier. (See § 211.9(c).) Full reimbursement of such costs up to $500 will be made by CCC upon receipt of invoices or other documents to support such costs. For amounts expended in excess of $500, reimbursement will be made upon receipt of supporting invoices or other documents establishing the costs of repackaging and showing the prior approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post to incur the costs, unless approval is waived under § 211.7(e).

    (2) Costs of repackaging required because of damage caused after discharge of the cargo from the ocean carrier will be reimbursed to the cooperating sponsor by CCC (USDA-ASCS Fiscal Division, 14th & Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250) upon receipt of supporting invoices or other documentation.

    § 211.8   Disposition of commodities unfit for authorized use.

#### § § 211.8

    (a)  If the commodity is damaged prior to delivery to a governmental cooperating sponsor at discharge port or point of entry overseas, USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall immediately arrange for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall arrange for such an inspection under these circumstances. Commodity that is determined to be unfit for authorized use shall be disposed of in accordance with the priority set forth in paragraph (b). Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged commodity shall be paid by USAID or the Diplomatic Post from the sales proceeds, from CCC Account No. 20FT401 or from the special title II, Public Law 480 Agricultural Commodity Account. The net proceeds of sales shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer American Embassy, for the credit of CCC Account No. 20FT401.

    (b)  (1) If after arrival in a foreign country it appears that all or part of the commodities, may be unfit for the use authorized in the Operational Plan or TA, the cooperating sponsor shall immediately arrange for inspection of the commodity by a public health official or other competent authority approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. If no competent local authority is available, USAID or the Diplomatic Post may determine whether the commodities are unfit, and if so, may direct disposal in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section. The cooperating sponsor shall arrange for the recovery for authorized use of that part designated during the inspection as suitable for program use. If, after inspection, the commodity (or any part thereof) is determined to be unfit for authorized use the cooperating sponsor shall notify USAID or the Diplomatic Post of the circumstances pertaining to the loss or damage as prescribed in § 211.9(f).

    (2) A cooperating sponsor shall dispose of commodities determined to be unfit for authorized use in the order of priority described in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section. The concurrence of USAID or the Diplomatic Post should be requested for disposition of commodities valued at $500 or more. If the USAID or Diplomatic Post does not respond to the cooperating sponsor's request for concurrence within 15 days, the cooperating sponsor may dispose of the commodities in the manner described in its request and inform the USAID or Diplomatic Post of its action taken in accordance with this section.

    (i) Sale for the most appropriate use, , animal feed, fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable price. When the commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated, removed or crossed out.

    (ii) Transfer to an approved Food for Peace program for use as livestock feed. AID/W shall be advised promptly of any such transfer so that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program can be reduced by an equivalent amount.

    (iii) Donation to a governmental or charitable organization for use as animal feed or for other nonfood use.

    (iv) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section is not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose. Commodities valued at $500 or more shall be destroyed under the observation of a representative of the USAID or Diplomatic Post if practicable. When the cooperating sponsor informs the USAID or Diplomatic Post of its intention to destroy commodities, the cooperating sponsor shall indicate the kind and amount of commodities that will be destroyed, the manner of destruction, the representative(s) of local authorities who will witness the destruction, and the date when the commodities will be destroyed. The date shall be established on the basis of programmatic need, but an effort should be made to provide a reasonable opportunity for a representative of the USAID or Diplomatic Post to attend. The commodities may be destroyed on the date indicated even if there is no representative of the USAID or Diplomatic Post to observe this action.

    (3) Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged commodity shall be paid by the cooperating sponsor unless it is determined by USAID or the Diplomatic Post that the damage could not have been prevented by the proper exercise of the cooperating sponsor's responsibility under the terms of the Operational Plan or TA. Actual expenses incurred, including third party costs, in selling the commodities may be deducted from the sales proceeds and, except for monetization programs, the net proceeds shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to CCC Account No. 20FT401. In monetization programs, net proceeds shall be deposited in the special account used for the approved program.

    (4) The cooperating sponsor shall furnish USAID or the Diplomatic Post a written report in accordance with § 211.9(f), and the report shall enclose a certification by a public health official or other competent authority of

    (i) The exact quantity of the damaged commodity disposed of because it was determined to be unfit for any use and

    (ii) The manner in which the commodities were destroyed.

    § 211.9   Liability for loss damage or improper distribution of commodities.

#### § § 211.9

    (Where the instructions in this § 211.9 state that the cooperating sponsor should contact USDA or CCC, the contact office is: Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205. For Section 211.9 (a) and (b) contact: KCCO, Chief, Processed Commodities Division. For § 211.9(c) contact: KCCO, Chief, Claims and Collections Division, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6105.)

    (a)  A cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. shall agree on a schedule for shipping commodities. A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor that books cargo for ocean transportation must notify USDA immediately if the vessel does not arrive at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed shipping schedule. USDA will determine whether the commodity shall be

    (1) Moved to another available outlet;

    (2) Stored at the port for delivery to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor when a vessel is available for loading; or

    (3) Disposed of as USDA may deem proper.

    (b)  A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall immediately notify CCC if there is a loss of or damage to commodities, between the time title is transferred to the cooperating sponsor and the time the commodities are loaded on board the vessel, that is caused by the act or omission of a third party, such as a warehouseman or carrier, who is or may be legally liable for the loss or damage. The cooperating sponsor also shall promptly assign to CCC any claim it has against the third party and forward to CCC all documents relating to the loss or damage and the claim. CCC shall have the right to initiate, prosecute, and retain the proceeds all claims for such loss or damage.

    (c) —(1)  (i) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall arrange for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo and to count or weigh the cargo and examine its condition, unless USAID or the Diplomatic Post determines that such examination is not feasible, or if CCC has made other provision for such examinations and reports. The surveyor shall prepare a report of its findings showing the quantity and condition of the commodities discharged. The report also shall show the probable cause of any damage noted, and set forth the time and place when the examination was made. If practicable, the examination of the cargo shall be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report shall be signed by all parties. Customs receipts, port authority reports, shortlanding certificates, cargo boat notes, stevedore's tallies, etc., where applicable, shall be obtained and furnished with the report of the surveyor. Whenever a damaged commodity appears unfit for its intended use, the cooperating sponsor shall obtain

    (A) A certification by a public health official or similar competent authority regarding the condition of the commodity; and

    (B) A certificate of disposition if the commodity is determined to be unfit for its intended use. These certificates shall be obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. If the cooperating sponsor can provide a narrative chronology or other commentary to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims, this information should be forwarded as follows: cooperating sponsors shall prepare such a statement in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000; all documentation shall be in English or supported by an English translation and shall be forwarded as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section; and the cost of an English translation shall be incorporated into the survey fee. The cooperating sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs or port areas to the cooperating sponsor or its agent and to issue delivery survey reports thereon.

    (ii) In the event of cargo loss or damage, a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall provide the names and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. In the case of bulk grain shipments, the cooperating sponsor shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:

    (A) Observe discharge of the cargo;

    (B) Report on discharging method (including whether a scale was used, its type and calibration and other factors affecting its accuracy, or an explanation of why a scale was not used and how weight was determined);

    (C) Furnish information as to whether cargo was discharged in accordance with port customs;

    (D) Provide actual or estimated (if scales not used) quantity of cargo lost during discharge and specify how such losses occurred;

    (E) Obtain copies of port and/or ship records including scale weights, where applicable, to show quantity discharged;

    (F) Verify that upon conclusion of discharge, cargo holds are empty;

    (G) Provide to USDA information as to quantity, type and cause of lost or damaged cargo;

    (H) Furnish daily tally totals and any other pertinent information about the bagging of the bulk cargo when cargo is bagged or stacked by vessel interests; and

    (I) Notify the cooperating sponsor immediately if additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged.

    (iii) Cooperating sponsors shall send to USDA copies of all reports and documents pertaining to the discharge of commodities. For those surveys arranged by CCC, the cooperating sponsors may obtain a copy of the report from the local USAID Food for Peace Officer.

    (iv) CCC will reimburse a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor for the costs incurred by it in obtaining the services of an independent surveyor to conduct examinations of the cargo and render the report set forth above. Reimbursement by CCC will be made upon receipt by CCC of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. However, CCC will not reimburse a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor for the costs of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation from the documentation requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is justified to the satisfaction of CCC.

    (v) CCC normally will contract for the survey of cargo on shipments furnished under Transfer Authorizations, including shipments for which A.I.D. contracts for the ocean transportation services. Survey contracts normally will be let on a competitive bid basis. However, if a USAID or Diplomatic Post desires that CCC limit its consideration to only certain selected surveyors, USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall furnish AID/W a list of eligible surveyors for forwarding to CCC. Surveyors may be omitted from the list, for instance, based on foreign relations considerations, conflicts of interest, and/or lack of demonstrated capability to carry out surveying responsibilities properly as set forth in the requirements of CCC. Upon receipt of written justification for removal of a particular survey firm, CCC will consider removal of such firm and advise the USAID via AID/W of the final determination. AID/W will furnish CCC's surveying requirements to a USAID or Diplomatic Post upon request. If CCC is unable to find a surveyor at a port to which a shipment has been consigned, CCC may request AID/W to contact USAID or the Diplomatic Post to arrange for a survey. The surveyor's bill for such services shall be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for review. After the billing has been approved, USAID or the Diplomatic Post either may pay the bill using funds in CCC account 20FT401, if available, or forward the bill to AID/W for transmittal to CCC for payment. If USAID or the Diplomatic Post pays the bill, AID/W shall be advised of the amount paid, and CCC will reimburse USAID or the Diplomatic Post.

    (2)  (i) Whether or not title to commodities has transferred from CCC to the cooperating sponsor, if A.I.D. contracted for the ocean transportation, CCC shall have the right to initiate, prosecute, and retain the proceeds of all claims against ocean carriers for cargo loss and/or damage arising out of shipments of commodities transferred or delivered by CCC hereunder.

    (ii)(A) Unless otherwise provided in the Operational Plan or TA, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall file notice of any cargo loss and/or damage with the ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any such loss and/or damage, promptly initiate claims against the ocean carrier for cargo loss and/or damage, take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses within any applicable periods of limitations, and transmit to CCC copies of all such claims. However, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor need not file a claim when the cargo loss and/or damage is not in excess of $100, or in any case when the loss and/or damage is between $100 and $300 and it is determined by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall transmit to CCC copies of all claims filed with the ocean carriers for cargo loss and/or damage, as well as information and/or documentation on shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, no action will be taken by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to file or collect claims for loss or damage to commodities. (See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.)

    (B) The value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall be determined on the basis of the domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage occurred, or, in case it is not feasible to obtain or determine such market price, the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to the cooperating sponsor. When value is determined on a cost basis, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors may add to the value any provable costs they have incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred by the U.S. Government. With respect to claims other than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, at the request of the cooperating sponsor or upon the recommendation of USAID or the Diplomatic Post, AID/W may determine that such value may be established on some other justifiable basis. When replacement is made, the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall be their value at the time and place the misuse, loss, or damage occurred and the value of the replacement commodities shall be their value at the time and place replacement is made.

    (C) Amounts collected by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors on claims against ocean carriers not in excess of $200 may be retained by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor. On claims involving loss and/or damage having a value in excess of $200, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors may retain from collections received by them, the larger of:

    () The amount of $200 plus _1_0 percent of the difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up to a maximum of $500, or

    () Actual administrative expenses incurred in collection of the claim if approved by CCC.

    (D) A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may redetermine claims on the basis of additional documentation or information, not considered when the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be furnished to CCC.

    (E) A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may negotiate compromise settlements of claims regardless of the amount thereof, except that proposed compromise settlements of claims having a value in excess of $5,000 shall not be accepted until such action has been approved in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may retain from the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special charges described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) as the compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is not in excess of $600, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may terminate collection activity on the claim according to the standards set forth in the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR 104.3. Approval of such termination by CCC is not required, but the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall notify CCC when collection activity on a claim is terminated.

    (F) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized herein to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of determining the amount to be retained by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the word “claim” shall refer to the loss and/or damage to commodities which are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier. If a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor is unable to collect a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof granted in writing by the liable party or parties, the rights of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to the claim shall be assigned to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall promptly assign their claim rights to CCC upon request. In the event CCC collects or settles the claim after the rights of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to the claim have been assigned CCC, CCC shall, except as shown below, pay to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor the amount the agency or organization would have been entitled to retain had they collected the same amount. However, the additional 10 percent on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable only if CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim prior to the assignment, or if payment is deemed to be commensurate with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting claims. In addition, if CCC determines that the documentation requirements of paragraph (c)(1) have not been fulfilled and the lack of such documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC reserves the right to deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor.

    (G) When nongovernmental cooperating sponsors fail to file claims, or permit claims to become time-barred, or fail to provide for the right of CCC to assert such claims, as provided in this § 211.9, and it is determined by CCC that such failure was due to the fault or negligence of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor, the agency or organization shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight (C&F) value of the commodities lost to the program.

    (iii) If a cargo loss has been incurred on a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shipment, and general average has been declared, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall furnish to CCC with a duplicate copy to AID/W—

    (A) Copies of booking confirmations and the applicable on-board bill(s) of lading,

    (B) The related outturn or survey report(s),

    (C) Evidence showing the amount of ocean transportation charges paid to the carrier(s), and

    (D) An assignment to CCC of the cooperating sponsor's right to the claim(s) for such loss.

    (iv) A.I.D. will initiate and prosecute claims against ocean carriers and defend claims by such carriers, arising from or relating to affreightment contracts booked by A.I.D. where the claims involve entitlement to freight and related costs from the U.S. Government. Proceeds of such claims received by A.I.D. shall be returned to CCC pursuant to agreed procedures.

    (d)  If a commodity, monetized proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not permitted under the Operational Plan or TA or this Regulation, or if a cooperating sponsor causes loss or damage to a commodity, monetized proceeds or program income through any act or omission or failure to provide proper storage, care and handling, the cooperating sponsor shall pay to the United States the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income, lost, damaged, or misused, unless A.I.D. determines that such improper distribution or use, or such loss or damage, could not have been prevented by proper exercise of the cooperating sponsor's responsibility under the Operational Plan or TA and this Regulation. In determining whether there was a proper exercise of the cooperating sponsor's responsibility, A.I.D. shall consider normal commercial practices in the country of distribution and the problems associated with carrying out programs in developing countries. Payment by the cooperating sponsor shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, except that the USAID or Diplomatic Post may agree to permit a cooperating sponsor to replace commodities lost, damaged, or misused with similar commodities of equal value.

    (e)  (1) In addition to survey and/or outturn reports to determine ocean carrier loss and damage, the cooperating sponsor shall, in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of entry into the recipient country and to make a report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the cooperating sponsor for the costs of a survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iv).

    (2) If a cooperating sponsor acquires any right against a person or governmental or nongovernmental organization based on an event for which the person or organization is responsible that resulted in the damage, loss or misuse of any commodity, monetized proceeds or program income, the cooperating sponsor shall file a claim against the liable party or parties for the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income lost damaged or misused and shall make every reasonable effort to collect the claim. A copy of the claim and related documents shall be provided to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Cooperating sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable to A.I.D. for the value of the commodities or monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused: Provided, however, that the cooperating sponsor may elect not to file a claim if the loss is less than $500 and such action is not detrimental to the program. Cooperating sponsors may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In addition, cooperating sponsors may, with the written approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post, retain either special costs such as reasonable legal fees that they have incurred in the collection of a claim, or pay such legal fees with monetized proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the full amount of the claim must be approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post prior to acceptance. When the cooperating sponsor has exhausted all reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request USAID or the Diplomatic Post to provide further instructions in accordance with paragraph (e)(4).

    (3)  A claim is the right a cooperating sponsor has against a third party as a result of an event for which the third party is responsible that caused the loss, damage or misuse of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. The amount of the claim is based on the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged or misused as a result of the event. An individual claim may not be broken down artificially to enlarge the amount the cooperating sponsor may retain as an administrative allowance on collection of the claim. For example, if a cooperating sponsor has a contract with a carrier to transport commodities, and losses occur during a single shipment of commodities from points A to B, the cooperating sponsor has one claim against the carrier, and the amount of the claim will be based on the total value of the commodities lost during the shipment from A to B even though some of the loss might have occurred on each of several trucks or by subcontractors used by the carrier to satisfy its contract responsibility to transport the commodities.

    (4) Reasonable attempts to collect the claim shall not be less than the follow-up of initial billings with three progressively stronger demands at not more than 30-day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal action in the judicial system of the cooperating country should be pursued unless:

    (i) Liability of the third party is not provable,

    (ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim,

    (iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating sponsor,

    (iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the cooperating sponsor's ability to conduct an effective program in the country, or

    (v) It is inappropriate for reasons relating to the judiciary or judicial system of the country.

    (5) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government of the cooperating country, the cooperating sponsor and the cooperating country may agree to settle disputed claims by an appropriate administrative procedure and/or arbitration. This alternative may be established in the Host Country Food for Peace Program Agreement required under § 211.3(b), or by a separate formal understanding, and must be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for review and approval. Resolution of disputed claims by any administrative procedure or arbitration agreed to by the cooperating sponsor and the cooperating country should be final and binding on the parties.

    (f)  (1) The cooperating sponsor shall provide the USAID or Diplomatic Post a quarterly report regarding any loss, damage or misuse of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. The report must be provided within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter and shall contain the following information except for commodity losses less than $500: who had possession of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income; who, if anyone, might be responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantity of commodities; the size and type of containers; the time and place of loss, damage or misuse; the current location of the commodities; the program number; CCC contract number, if known, and if not known, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the loss, damage or misuse. If any of this information is not available, the cooperating sponsor shall explain why it is not. The report simply may identify separately commodity losses valued at less than $500 and indicate the estimated value of the commodities lost damaged or misused and the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal, except that the cooperating sponsor shall inform the USAID or Diplomatic Post if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the loss, damage or misuse of such commodities and provide the information described above for losses of $500 or more together with such other information available to it. USAID or the Diplomatic Post may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused. Information in the quarterly report may be provided in tabular form to the extent possible, and the report shall enclose a copy of any claim made by the cooperating sponsor during the reporting period.

    (2) If any commodity, monetized proceeds or program income is lost or misused under circumstances which give a cooperating sponsor reason to believe that the loss or misuse has occurred as a result of criminal activity, the cooperating sponsor shall promptly report these circumstances to the A.I.D. Inspector General through AID/W, USAID or the Diplomatic Post, and subsequently to the appropriate authorities of the cooperating country unless instructed not to do so by A.I.D. The cooperating sponsor also shall cooperate fully with any subsequent investigation by the Inspector General and/or authorities of the cooperating country.

    (g)  Claims against ocean carriers shall be collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid, or a pro rata share of each) and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors to CCC. With respect to commodities, claims against nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall be paid to CCC or AID/W in U.S. dollars; amounts paid by other cooperating sponsors and third parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with instructions to credit the deposit to CCC Account No. 12X4336, or in local currency with instructions to credit the deposit to Treasury sales account 20FT401. Any conversion required for these deposits shall be at the highest rate of exchange legally obtainable on the date of deposit unless A.I.D. agrees otherwise in writing. With respect to monetized proceeds and program income, amounts recovered should be deposited into the special interest-bearing account established for the monetized proceeds and may be used for purposes of the approved program.

    (h)  CCC shall—

    (1) Be responsible for settling general average and marine salvage claims;

    (2) Retain the authority to make or authorize any disposition of commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean transit is interrupted, and receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting from such disposition;

    (3) In the event of a declaration of general average, initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo loss and damage claims against ocean carriers; and

    (4) Receive and retain any allowance in general average. CCC will pay any general average or marine salvage claims determined to be due.

    § 211.10   Records and reporting requirements.

#### § § 211.10

    (a)  Cooperating sponsors and recipient agencies shall maintain records and documents in a manner which accurately reflects the operation of the program and all transactions pertaining to the receipt, storage, distribution, sale, inspection and use of commodities and to receipt and disbursement of any monetized proceeds and program income. Such records shall be retained for a period of 3 years from the close of the U.S. fiscal year to which they pertain, or longer, upon request by A.I.D. for cause, such as in the case of litigation of a claim or an audit concerning such records. The cooperating sponsor shall transfer to A.I.D. any records, or copies thereof, requested by A.I.D.

    (b)  Cooperating sponsors shall submit two copies of audits performed in accordance to § 211.5(c). In addition, cooperating sponsors shall submit to USAID or the Diplomatic Post, and to AID/W such reports as A.I.D. may reasonably request. The following is a list of the principal types of reports that are to be submitted at least annually:

    (1) Periodic summary reports showing receipt, distribution, and inventory of commodities and proposed schedules of shipments or calls forward.

    (2) Reports relating to the generation of monetized proceeds and program income and the use of such funds for purposes specified in the Operational Plan or TA. See § 211.5(l).

    (3) Reports relating to progress and problems in the implementation of the program.

    (4) Reports shall be submitted in sufficient detail to enable USAID or the Diplomatic Post to assess and to make recommendations as to the ability of the cooperating sponsors to effectively plan, manage, control and evaluate the Food for Peace programs under their administration.

    (5) At the time that an emergency program under Public Law 480, title II is initiated, whether by a governmental or nongovernmental cooperating sponsor, USAID or the Diplomatic Post should

    (i) Make a determination regarding the ability of the cooperating sponsor to perform the record-keeping required by this § 211.10, and

    (ii) In those instances in which those specific record-keeping requirements cannot be followed, due to emergency circumstances, specify exactly which essential information will be recorded in order to account fully for title II commodities and monetized proceeds.

    (c)  Cooperating sponsors and recipient agencies shall cooperate with and assist U.S. Government representatives to enable them at any reasonable time to:

    (1) Examine activities and records of the cooperating sponsor, recipient agencies, processors, or others, pertaining to the receipt, storage, distribution, processing, repackaging, sale and use of commodities by recipients;

    (2) Inspect commodities in storage, or the facilities used in the handling or storage of commodities;

    (3) Examine and audit books and records, including financial books and records and reports pertaining to storage, transportation, processing, repackaging, distribution, sale and use of commodities and pertaining to the deposit and use of any monetized proceeds and program income;

    (4) Review the overall effectiveness of the program as it relates to the objectives set forth in the Operational Plan or TA; and

    (5) Examine or audit the procedure and methods used in carrying out the requirements of this Regulation.

    § 211.11   Suspension, termination, and expiration of program.

#### § § 211.11

    (a)  All or any part of the assistance provided under the program, including commodities in transit, may be terminated or suspended by A.I.D. at its discretion if AID/W determines that a cooperating sponsor has failed to comply with the provisions of the approved Operational Plan or TA, or of this Regulation, or that the continuation of such assistance is no longer necessary or desirable. If AID/W believes that circumstances permit, AID/W will provide a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor written notice of A.I.D.'s intention to terminate or suspend the cooperating sponsor's program, together with an explanation of the reason(s) for A.I.D.'s action, at least 30 days prior to the date indicated in the notice that the program will be terminated or suspended. Comments provided by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor prior to the effective date of the termination or suspension shall be considered by AID/W in determining whether to rescind the notice. When a program is terminated or suspended, title to commodities which have been transferred to the cooperating sponsor, or monetized proceeds, program income and real or personal property procured with monetized proceeds or program income shall, at the written request of USAID, the Diplomatic Post or AID/W, be transferred to the U.S. Government by the cooperating sponsor or shall otherwise be transferred by the cooperating sponsor as directed by A.I.D.

  PART 212—PUBLIC INFORMATION

### Part 212

**Authority:** Authority: Pub. L. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538.

**Source:** Source: 87 FR 70721, Nov. 21, 2022.

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 212.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 212.1

      This subpart contains the rules that the United States Agency for International Development (hereinafter “USAID” or “the Agency”) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this subpart should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, are processed under Subpart O. Definitions of FOIA terms are referenced in subpart L of this part.

      § 212.2   Policy.

#### § § 212.2

      (a) As a general policy, USAID follows a balanced approach in administering the FOIA. USAID recognizes the right of the public to access information in the possession of the Agency. USAID also recognizes the legitimate interests of organizations or persons who have submitted records to the Agency or who would otherwise be affected by release of records. USAID has no discretion to release certain records, such as trade secrets and confidential commercial information, prohibited from release by law. USAID's policy calls for the fullest responsible disclosure consistent with those requirements of administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized under the FOIA.

      (b) For purposes of subparts A through K, M, and O of this part,  means information regardless of its physical form or characteristics including information created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means that is created or obtained by the Agency and under the control of the Agency at the time of the request, including information maintained for the Agency by an entity under Government contract for _record_s management purposes. It does not include records that are not already in existence and that would have to be created specifically to respond to a request. Information available in electronic form shall be searched and compiled in response to a request unless such search and compilation would significantly interfere with the operation of the Agency's automated information systems.

      § 212.3   Records available on the Agency's website.

#### § § 212.3

      Information that is required to be published in the  under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) is regularly updated by the Agency and found on its public website,  or for records of the Office of the USAID Inspector General (OIG), on the FOIA page of OIG's public website,  Records required by FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) are available on the Agency's and OIG's public websites.

    Subpart B—Proactive Disclosures of Agency Records

      § 212.4   Materials available for public inspection and in electronic format.

#### § § 212.4

      (a) In accordance with this subpart, the Agency shall make the following materials available for public inspection in an electronic format:

      (1) Operational policy in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) which have been adopted by the Agency and are not published in the ;

      (2) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect any member of the public; and

      (3) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released pursuant to a FOIA request, and which have been requested three (3) or more times, or because of the nature of their subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. The Agency shall decide on a case by case basis whether records fall into this category, based on the following factors:

      (i) Previous experience with similar records;

      (ii) The particular characteristics of the records involved, including their nature and the type of information contained in them; and

      (iii) The identity and number of requesters and whether there is widespread media, historical, academic, or commercial interest in the records.

      (b) [Reserved]

    Subpart C—Requirements for Making Requests

      § 212.5   How to make a request for records.

#### § § 212.5

      (a) USAID has a de-centralized system for responding to FOIA requests for all USAID records. The USAID FOIA operations are broken down into two component FOIA Offices: The Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services, Information and Records Division (M/MS/IRD) and the Office of the USAID Inspector General (OIG).

      (b) The Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services, Information and Records Division (M/MS/IRD) is the central processing point for requests for USAID records contained in Washington, DC and its overseas missions. All FOIA requests for USAID records (other than OIG records) must be submitted to this office. To make a request for the Agency's records, a requester may send request via one of the following mediums:

      (1)  Please include your mailing address, email address, phone number, and fee category with your request. While our FOIA Specialists are happy to answer questions about the FOIA Program and/or help you formulate your request over the phone, please be advised that FOIA requests cannot be accepted by phone.

      (2)  To submit your request online, please click the subsequent link:

      (3)  United States Agency for International Development Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services Services, Information and Records Division USAID Annex, Room 2.4.0A, Washington, DC 20523.

      (4) By Telephone: (202) 916-4661.

      (5) By Fax: (202) 916-4990.

      (c) The Inspector General has received delegated authority from USAID's Administrator to process requests and issue determinations with respect to requests, and appeals of initial denials of requests, for the OIG's records. To make a request for OIG records, a requester may send a request via one of the following mediums:

      (1)   Please include your mailing address, email address, phone number, and fee category with your request.

      (2)  Please submit a request online via the OIG website at

      (3)  United States Agency of International Development Office of Inspector General, Office of General Counsel 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 6.06-D, Washington, DC 20523.

      (4)  (202) 712-1150.

      (d) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized consent form signed by the person who is the subject of the records, or a signed declaration by that person, made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). In addition, requesters may present an argument that there exists an overriding public interest in disclosure of the information related to official misconduct by producing evidence that alleged Government impropriety occurred. As an exercise of administrative discretion, the component's FOIA office can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

      (e) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable the component's FOIA office personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component FOIA office's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If, after receiving a request, the component's FOIA office determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component's FOIA office shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component FOIA office's designated FOIA Specialist or its FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component FOIA office's response to the request may be delayed or denied.

    Subpart D—Responsibility for Responding to Requests

      § 212.6   Designation of authorized officials.

#### § § 212.6

      (a) The Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Management(M) serves as the USAID Chief FOIA Officer. The Chief FOIA Officer has overall responsibility for USAID compliance with the FOIA. The Chief FOIA Officer provides high level oversight and support to USAID's FOIA programs, and recommends adjustments to agency practices, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to improve FOIA administration, including through an annual Chief FOIA Officers Report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. The Chief FOIA Officer is responsible for offering training to agency staff regarding their FOIA responsibilities; serves as the primary liaison with the Office of Government Information Services and the Office of Information Policy; and reviews, not less frequently than annually, all aspects of the Agency's administration of the FOIA to ensure compliance with the FOIA's requirements.

      (b) The Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services, Information and Records Division (M/MS/IRD) is the component FOIA office that receives, tracks, and processes all of USAID's FOIA requests, other than requests for OIG records, to ensure transparency within the Agency.

      (c) The Deputy Director, Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services (M/MS/OD) serves as the USAID FOIA Appeals Officer for requests for all USAID records other than OIG records. The FOIA Appeals Officer is responsible for receiving and acting upon appeals from requesters whose initial FOIA requests for USAID records (other than OIG records) have been denied, in whole or in part.

      (d) The Deputy Inspector General serves as the USAID OIG FOIA Appeals Officer for appeals of requests for OIG records.

      (e) The Chief, Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services, Information and Records Division (M/MS/IRD) serves as USAID's FOIA Officer and USAID's FOIA Public Liaison. The FOIA Officer is responsible for program direction, original denials, and policy decisions required for effective implementation of USAID's FOIA program. The FOIA Public Liaison serves as a supervisory official to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns about the services received, following an initial response from the FOIA staff. In addition, the FOIA Public Liaison assists, as appropriate, in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and resolving disputes.

      (f) The General Counsel to the Inspector General serves as the OIG's FOIA Officer and FOIA Public Liaison.

      (g) The Supervisory FOIA Team Lead is the Principal Operations Officer within the component's FOIA office for the processing of FOIA requests and release determinations.

      (h) The FOIA Specialist also known as the Government Information Specialist (GIS) is responsible for processing requests and preparing records for release when such releases are authorized by the FOIA. They do not have the authority to make denials, including “no records” responses.

      (i) The General Counsel (GC), FOIA Backstop Attorney Advisor has responsibility for providing legal advice on all USAID matters regarding or resulting from the FOIA (other than OIG matters). Upon request, GC advises M/MS/IRD on release and denial decisions, and apprises the FOIA Office of all significant developments with respect to the FOIA.

      (j) OIG attorneys have responsibility for providing legal advice on all requests and appeals related to OIG records.

      (k) Each Attorney Advisor designated to provide legal advice to USAID Bureaus/Independent Offices (B/IOs) is responsible for providing, at M/MS/IRD's request, legal advice on FOIA requests assigned to those B/IOs.

      (l) The designated FOIA Liaison Officer (FLO) in each USAID Bureau and Office is responsible for tasking and facilitating the collection of responsive records and monitoring the production of records to M/MS/IRD.

      § 212.7   Processing of request.

#### § § 212.7

      (a)  In determining which records are responsive to a request, the component's FOIA office ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the component's FOIA office shall inform the requester of that date.

      (b)  The FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by the Agency (other than OIG records). The OIG FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records maintained by OIG.

      (c)  When reviewing records located by the Agency in response to a request, the component's FOIA office shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. All consultations and referrals received by the Agency will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request. As to any such record, the component's FOIA office shall proceed in one of the following ways:

      (1)  When records originated with USAID, but contain within them information of substantial interest to another agency, or other Federal Government office, the component's FOIA office should consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.

      (2)  (i) When a component's FOIA office believes that a different Department, agency, or component, is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component's FOIA office will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to an agency that is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component's FOIA office and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

      (ii) Whenever the component's FOIA office refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

      (iii) Where a component's FOIA office determines that a request was misdirected within the agency, the receiving component's FOIA office must route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component within the agency.

      (3)  The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component's FOIA office will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will then be conveyed to the requester by the component's FOIA office.

      (d)  On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component's FOIA office must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the component's FOIA office must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever USAID's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the component's FOIA office must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.

      (e)  The component's FOIA office shall furnish copies only of records that the Agency has in its possession. The Agency is not compelled to create new records. The Agency is not required to perform research for a requester. The component's FOIA office is required to furnish only one copy of a record. If information exists in different forms, the component's FOIA office will provide the record in the form that best conserves government resources. Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought by the requester. The component's FOIA office will accommodate the form or format request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.

      (f)  The Agency ordinarily transfers records in accordance with its retirement authority, included in ADS 502, to the National Archives and Records Administration. These records become the physical and legal custody of the National Archives. Accordingly, requests for retired Agency records should be submitted to the National Archives by mail addressed to Special Access and FOIA Staff (NWCTF), 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500, College Park, MD 20740 by fax to (301) 837¬1864 or by email to

      (g)  If USAID cannot make a legible copy of a record to be released, the Agency is not required to reconstruct it. Instead, the component's FOIA office will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in the component's FOIA office reply.

    Subpart E—Timing of Responses to Requests

      212.8   Time limits.

#### § 212.8

      (a)  The component's FOIA office ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt.

      (b)  (1) The component's FOIA office shall designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The component's FOIA office may designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the component's FOIA office may consider are, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The component's FOIA office shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

      (2) The component's FOIA office shall generally process requests in each track on a “first-in, first-out” basis.

      (c)  Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component's FOIA office extends the time limit on that basis, the component's FOIA office shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component's FOIA office shall, in the written notice, notify the requester of the right to contact the component's FOIA office's FOIA Public Liaison, or seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). In addition, the component's FOIA office shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing.

      (d)  For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the component's FOIA office may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The component's FOIA office shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

      (e)  (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

      (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

      (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;

      (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

      (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.

      (2) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the component's FOIA office may waive the formal certification requirement.

      (3) The component's FOIA office shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.

    Subpart F—Responses to Requests

      § 212.9   Responsibility for responding to requests.

#### § § 212.9

      (a)  The component's FOIA office should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.

      (b)  The component's FOIA office shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number. The component's FOIA office shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

      (c)  Once the component's FOIA office makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The component's FOIA office also shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.

      (d)  Whenever the component's FOIA office consults with another Federal Government office over the releasability of a record, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of the consultation and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency or office with which the consultation is taking place. Whenever the component's FOIA office refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another Federal Government office, the component's FOIA office shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, notify the requester of the referral, and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

      (e)  If the component's FOIA office has made an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of that determination in writing, and provide the contact information for the FOIA Public Liaison, as well as a description of the requester's right to seek mediation services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. A response will provide an estimate of the volume of any records or any information withheld. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.

      (f)  All denials are in writing and describe in general terms the material withheld; state the reasons for the denial, including, as applicable, a reference to the specific exemption of the FOIA authorizing the withholding; explain your right to appeal the decision and identify the official to whom you should send the appeal; and are signed by the person who made the decision to deny all or part of the request. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.

      (g)  USAID performs a diligent search for records to satisfy your request. Nevertheless, the Agency may not be able to find the records requested using the information provided, or the records may not exist.

    Subpart G—Confidential Commercial Information

      § 212.10   Policy and procedures.

#### § § 212.10

      (a) —(1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by the Agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

      (2)  means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

      (b)  A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

      (c)  (1) The component's FOIA office shall promptly provide written notice to a business submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component's FOIA office determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

      (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the business submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (ii) The component's FOIA office has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.

      (2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.

      (d)  The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:

      (1) The component's FOIA office determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;

      (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

      (4) The designation made by the business submitter appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component's FOIA office shall give the business submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

      (e)  (1) The component's FOIA office shall specify a reasonable time period within which the business submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (c) of this section. If a business submitter has any objections to disclosure, the business submitter should:

      (i) Provide the component's FOIA office with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the business submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

      (ii) [Reserved].

      (2) A business submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component's FOIA office after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the component's FOIA office. Any information provided by a business submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (f)  The component's FOIA office shall consider a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

      (g)  Whenever the component's FOIA office decides to disclose information over the objection of a business submitter, the component's FOIA office shall provide the business submitter written notice, which shall include:

      (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the business submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.

      (h)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component's FOIA office shall promptly notify the business submitter.

      (i)  The component's FOIA office shall notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

    Subpart H—Administrative Appeals

      § 212.11   Appeal procedures.

#### § § 212.11

      The component's FOIA office must inform the requester of the reasons for the denial and the requester's right to appeal the denial to the FOIA Appeals Officer whenever a FOIA request is denied.

      (a)  A requester may appeal the withholding of a document or denial of a fee waiver request. A requester may contest the type or amount of fees that were charged, or may appeal any other type of adverse determination under the FOIA. A requester may also appeal because USAID failed to conduct an adequate search for the documents requested. However, a requester may not file an administrative appeal for the lack of a timely response. A requester may administratively appeal any portion denied when their request is granted in part and denied in part.

      (b)  A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the component's FOIA office. The requester must make the appeal in writing. To be considered timely, the appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the component FOIA office's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

      (c)  (1) The Deputy Director of the Bureau for Management Services or designee will conduct _de novo_ review and make the final determination on the appeals related to all Agency records other than OIG records. The Deputy Inspector General will conduct  review and make the final determination on the appeals relating to OIG records.

      (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

      (d)  A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds the component FOIA office's determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Mediation is a voluntary process. If the component's FOIA office agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the component FOIA office's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component's FOIA office will thereafter further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.

      (e)  Before seeking review by a court of the component FOIA office's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

      (f)  An appeal (other than appeals related to OIG records) may be filed by sending a letter to: FOIA Appeals Officer, Bureau for Management, Deputy Director, Office of Management Services, U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID Annex, M/MS, Room 10.8 OD, Washington, DC 20523; or by email at  An appeal relating to OIG records may be filed by sending a letter to: Deputy Inspector General, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development, Suite 6.06-D, RRB, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20523-4601; or by email at  There is no charge for filing an administrative appeal.

      § 212.12   Mediation and dispute services.

#### § § 212.12

      (a) The Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS) is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) resource for the public and the government. Congress has charged OGIS with reviewing FOIA policies, procedures and compliance of Federal agencies and to recommend changes to the FOIA. OGIS' mission also includes providing dispute resolution services between Federal agencies and requesters. OGIS works as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

      (b) When the component's FOIA office makes a determination on a request, the component's FOIA office shall offer the services of the FOIA Public Liaison, and will notify requesters of the mediation services provided by OGIS. Specifically, the component's FOIA office will include in the component's FOIA office's notification to the requester:

      (1) The right of the requester to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison of the component's FOIA office, and in the case of an adverse determination;

      (2) The right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison of the component's FOIA office or the Office of Government Information Services.

    Subpart I—Preservation of Records

      § 212.13   Policy and procedures.

#### § § 212.13

      The component's FOIA office shall preserve all correspondence relating to the requests it receives under this subpart, and all records processed pursuant to such requests, until such time as the destruction of such correspondence and records is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Under no circumstances shall records be sent to a Federal Records Center, transferred to the permanent custody of NARA, or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or civil action under the FOIA.

    Subpart J—Fees

      § 212.14   Fees to be charged—general.

#### § § 212.14

      (a)  The component's FOIA office shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the component's FOIA office may contact a requester for additional information. The component's FOIA office shall ensure that search, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The component's FOIA office ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The component FOIA office's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.

      (2)  are those expenses that the Agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. _Direct costs_ do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

      (3)  is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

      (4)  is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Agencies may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.

      (5)  is a waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.

      (6)  is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.

      (7)  is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.

      (8)  is one of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The three categories are: commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and all other requesters.

      (9)  is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. _Review_ time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (10)  is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. _Search_ time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

      (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, the component's FOIA office shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section.

      (1)  Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The component's FOIA office may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

      (2)  Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The component's FOIA office shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component's FOIA office in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component's FOIA office shall provide one copy per request at a cost of ten cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time shall be charged. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the component's FOIA office shall charge the direct costs.

      (3)  Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by the component's FOIA office to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the component's FOIA office re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.

      (d)  (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for commercial use.

      (2) When the component's FOIA office determines that unusual circumstances apply to the processing of a request, and the component's FOIA office has provided timely written notice to the requester, the delay is excused for an additional 10 days. If the component's FOIA office fails to comply with the extended time limit, it may not charge search fees (or for requesters with preferred fee status, may not charge duplication fees) except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i)  If unusual circumstances apply and more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component's FOIA office may charge search fees (or, for requesters in preferred fee status, may charge duplication fees) if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the component's FOIA office has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.

      (ii)  If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the component's FOIA office's failure to comply with a time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (3) If the component's FOIA office fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees.

      (4) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

      (5) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the component's FOIA office shall provide without charge:

      (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

      (ii) The first two hours of search.

      (6) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.

      (e)  (1) When the component's FOIA office determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component's FOIA office shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

      (2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The component's FOIA office is not required to accept payments in installments.

      (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component's FOIA office estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component's FOIA office shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component's FOIA office shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

      (4) The component's FOIA office shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA Specialists to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

      (f)  Although not required to provide special services, if the component's FOIA office chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

      (g)  The component's FOIA office may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component's FOIA office. The component's FOIA office shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (h)  When the component's FOIA office reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component's FOIA office may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The component's FOIA office may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the component's FOIA office will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

      (i)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the component's FOIA office shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (2) When the component's FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The component's FOIA office may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

      (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the component's FOIA office within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the component's FOIA office may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component's FOIA office may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component's FOIA office begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If the component's FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

      (4) In cases in which the component's FOIA office requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component FOIA office's fee determination, the request will be closed.

      (j)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component's FOIA office shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

      (k)  (1) Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (c) of this section, where the component's FOIA office determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and

      (ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government, the component's FOIA office shall consider all four of the following factors:

      (i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

      (ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

      (iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, the component's FOIA office shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.

      (3) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the component's FOIA office shall consider the following factors:

      (i) The component's FOIA office shall identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

      (ii) A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The component's FOIA office ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

      (4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

      (5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component's FOIA office and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received. A requester may appeal the denial of a fee waiver.

      § 212.15   Fees to be charged—requester categories.

      (b) If copies of records are provided in other than paper format (such as on microfiche, video tape, or as electronic data files), or other than first-class mail is requested or required, the requester is charged the actual cost of providing these additional services.

    Subpart K—FOIA Definitions

      § 212.16   Glossary.

#### § § 212.16

      As used in this part:

      is an independent review of the initial determination made in response to a FOIA request. Requesters who are dissatisfied with the response made on their initial request have a statutory right to appeal the initial determination made by the component's FOIA office.

      is any executive agency, military agency, government corporation, government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any independent regulatory agency. Thus, USAID is an agency.

      is a request that typically seeks a high volume of material or requires additional steps to process such as the need to search for records in multiple locations.

      is when USAID locates a record that contains information of substantial interest to another agency, and the component's FOIA office asks for the views of that other agency on the disclosability of the records before any final determination is made.

      is information that the component's FOIA office releases even though it could have been withheld under one of the FOIA's exemptions.

      is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

      is any information that is recorded in a form that only a computer can process and that satisfies the definition of a Federal record per the  Federal electronic records are not necessarily kept in a “recordkeeping system” but may reside in a generic electronic information system or are produced by an application such as word processing or electronic mail.

      are nine categories of information that are not required to be released in response to a FOIA request because release would be harmful to a government or private interest. These categories are called “exemptions” from disclosures.

      is the FOIA response track granted in certain limited situations, specifically when a FOIA request is processed ahead of other pending requests.

      or  is a United States Federal law that grants the public access to information possessed by government agencies. Upon written request, U.S. Government agencies are required to release information unless it falls under one of nine exemptions listed in the Act.

      are records that have been requested three (3) or more times from the component's FOIA office.

      is a system that divides in-coming FOIA requests according to their complexity so that simple requests requiring relatively minimal review are placed in one processing track and more complex requests are placed in one or more other tracks. Requests granted expedited processing are placed in yet another track. Requests in each track are processed on a first-in/first-out basis.

      (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and agencies as an alternative to litigation. OGIS also reviews agency FOIA compliance, policies, and procedures and makes recommendations for improvement. The Office is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration, and was created by Congress as part of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended the FOIA.

      are records made publicly available by agencies without waiting for a specific FOIA request. Agencies now post on their websites' material concerning their functions and mission. The FOIA itself requires agencies to make available certain categories of information, including final opinions and orders, specific policy statements, certain administrative staff manuals and frequently requested records.

      means information regardless of its physical form or characteristics including information created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means that is created or obtained by the Agency and under the control of the Agency at the time of the request, including information maintained for the Agency by an entity under Government contract for records management purposes. It does not include records that are not already in existence and that would have to be created specifically to respond to a request. Information available in electronic form shall be searched and compiled in response to a request unless such search and compilation would significantly interfere with the operation of the Agency's automated information systems.

      occurs when an agency locates a record that originated with, or is of otherwise primary interest to another Department, agency, or component. It will forward that record to the other agency to process the record and to provide the final determination directly to the requester.

      is a FOIA request that a component's FOIA office anticipates will involve a small volume of material or which will be able to be processed relatively quickly.

    Subpart L—Other Rights and Services

      § 212.17   Rights and services qualified by the FOIA statute.

#### § § 212.17

      Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as a right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.

    Subpart M—Privacy Act Provisions

      § 212.18   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 212.18

      This subpart contains the rules that the USAID follows under the Privacy Act of 1974 (PA), 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. These rules should be read together with the text of the statute, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained by the agency that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the agency. If any records retrieved pursuant to an access request under the PA are found to be exempt from access under that Act, they will be processed for possible disclosure under the FOIA, as amended. No fees shall be charged for access to or amendment of PA records.

      § 212.19   Privacy definitions.

#### § § 212.19

      As used in this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:

      (a)  means a citizen or a legal permanent resident alien (LPR) of the United States.

      (b)  includes maintain, collect, use, or disseminate.

      (c)  means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by the agency and that contains the individual's name or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or photograph.

      (d)  means a group of any records under the control of the agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to an individual.

      § 212.20   Request for access to records.

#### § § 212.20

      (a)  Requests for access to records (other than OIG records) under the PA must be made in writing and mailed to the Bureau for Management Services, Information and Records Division at the address given in § 212.5. Requests for access to OIG records under the PA must be made in writing and mailed to the Office of General Counsel for the OIG at the address given in § 212.5.

      (b)  Requests for access should describe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit identification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include the individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and any other names used, current complete mailing address, (city, state and country). Helpful data includes the approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that give the individual reason to believe that the agency maintains a record under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if known, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In certain instances, it may be necessary for the component's FOIA office to request additional information from the requester, either to ensure a full search, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to the individual.

      (c)  The component's FOIA office will require reasonable identification of individuals requesting records about themselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are only accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full name, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien status, and date (city, state, and country). The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. If the requester seeks records under another name the requester has used, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has also used the other name must be included.

      (d)  The component's FOIA office may process third party requests, as described in this section. In the absence of a request by, or prior written consent of, the individual to whom the records pertain, the component's FOIA office will process third party requests under the FOIA. The Agency's form, AID 507-1, may be used to certify the identity and provide third party authorization.

      (1)  Upon presentation of acceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a parent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person under the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under the PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors may request such records on their own behalf.

      (2)  A guardian of an individual who has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on behalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate documentation of the guardian relationship.

      (3)  Third-party access to an individual's records shall be granted pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual. The designated third party must submit identity verification information described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (e)  If the component's FOIA office determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another Department, agency, or component it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency for direct response to the requester. If the agency determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request are of interest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before responding to the request. The component's FOIA office may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.

      (f)  Nothing in this subpart entitles an individual to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

      (g)  The component's FOIA office will acknowledge the request promptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible thereafter.

      § 212.21   Request to amend or correct records.

#### § § 212.21

      (a) An individual has the right to request that the component's FOIA office amend a record pertaining to the individual that the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.

The component's FOIA office will coordinate the review of the request with the appropriate offices of the Agency. The component's FOIA office will require verification of personal identity before it will initiate action to amend a record. Amendment requests should contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate the record in question, a description of the specific correction requested, and an explanation of why the existing record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. The requester should submit as much pertinent documentation, other information, and explanation as possible to support the request for amendment.

      (c) All requests for amendments to records shall be acknowledged within 10 working days.

      (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the Agency shall review the record to determine if it is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.

      (e) If the Agency agrees with an individual's request to amend a record, it shall:

      (1) Advise the individual in writing of its decision;

      (2) Amend the record accordingly; and

      (3) If an accounting of disclosure has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance.

      (f) If the Agency denies an individual's request to amend a record, it shall advise the individual in writing of its decision and the reason for the refusal, and the procedures for the individual to request further review. See § 171.25 of this chapter.

      § 212.22   Request for accounting of record disclosures.

#### § § 212.22

      (a)  Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, or where accountings of disclosures do not need to be provided to a requesting individual pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), an individual has a right to request an accounting of any disclosure that the component's FOIA office has made to another person, organization, or agency of any record about an individual. This accounting shall contain the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure as well as the name and address of the recipient of the disclosure. Any request for accounting should identify each particular record in question and may be made by writing directly to the Appeals Officer, Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services at the address given in § 212.19.

      (b)  The component's FOIA office is not required to keep an accounting of disclosures in the case of:

      (1) Disclosures made to employees within the Agency who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties; and

      (2) Disclosures required under the FOIA.

      § 212.23   Appeals from denials of PA amendment requests.

#### § § 212.23

Any such appeal must be postmarked within 60 working days of the date of the component FOIA office's denial letter and sent to: Appeals Officer, Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services (for non-OIG records), and Deputy Inspector General, Office of Inspector General (for OIG records) at the addresses given in § 212.11.

      (b) Appellants should submit an administrative appeal of any denial, in whole or in part, of a request for access to the PA at the above address. The component's FOIA office will assign a tracking number to the appeal.

      (c) The Appeals Review Panel will decide appeals from denials of PA amendment requests within 30 business days, unless the Panel extends that period for good cause shown, from the date when it is received by the Panel.

      (d) Appeals Review Panel decisions will be made in writing, and appellants will receive notification of the decision. A reversal will result in reprocessing of the request in accordance with that decision. An affirmance will include a brief statement of the reason for the affirmance and will inform the appellant that the decision of the Panel represents the final decision of the Agency and of the right to seek judicial review of the Panel's decision, when applicable.

      (e) If the Panel's decision is that a record shall be amended in accordance with the appellant's request, the Chairman—USAID'S FOIA Liaison Officer or their designee shall direct the office responsible for the record to amend the record, advise all previous recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance (if an accounting of previous disclosures has been made), and so advise the individual in writing.

      (f) If the Panel's decision is that the amendment request is denied, in addition to the notification required by paragraph (d) of this section, the Chairman—USAID'S FOIA Liaison Officer or their designee-shall advise the appellant:

      (1) Of the right to file a concise Statement of Disagreement stating the reasons for disagreement with the decision of the Agency;

      (g) If the appellant files a Statement of Disagreement under paragraph (f) of this section, the component's FOIA office will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently access the record. When the disputed record is subsequently disclosed, the component's FOIA office will note the dispute and provide a copy of the Statement of Disagreement. The component's FOIA office may also include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the record. Copies of the component FOIA office's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record for granting access; however, it will not be subject to amendment by an individual under this part.

      § 212.24   Specific exemptions.

#### § § 212.24

      (a) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), the Director or the Administrator may, where there is a compelling reason to do so, exempt a system of records, from any of the provisions of subsections (c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I); and (f) of the Act if a system of records is:

      (1) Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1); (2) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of the Act: Provided, however, that if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence;

      (2) Maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056;

      (3) Required by statute to be maintained and used solely as statistical records;

      (4) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence;

      (5) Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service, the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process; or

      (6) Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

      (b) Each notice of a system of records that is the subject of an exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) will include a statement that the system has been exempted, the reasons therefore, and a reference to the  volume and page, where the exemption rule can be found.

      (c) The systems of records to be exempted under section (k) of the Act, the provisions of the Act from which they are being exempted, and the justification for the exemptions, are set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:

      (1)  If the 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) exemption claimed under § 215.13(c) of this chapter and on the notice of systems of records to be published in the  on this same date is held to be invalid, then this system is determined to be exempt, under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and (k)(1) and (2) of the Act, from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to protect the materials required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy, to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel.

      (2)  This system is exempt under U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), and (5) from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I), and (f). These exemptions are claimed to protect the materials required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering those sources and, ultimately, to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants or persons for a given position or contract. Special note is made of the limitation on the extent to which this exemption may be asserted.

      (3)  This system is exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(1), (2), and (5) from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I), and (f). These exemptions are claimed to protect the materials required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information.

#### § § 213.1

      (a)  This part prescribes standards and procedures for the collection and disposal of claims due to the United States from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This part covers USAID's administrative actions to collect claims/debts (including administrative and salary offsets; compromise; suspension or termination of collection actions; transfer and/or referral of claims to the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Justice). The terms “claim” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that an appropriate USAID official has determined to be due to the United States from any person, organization, or entity except another Federal Department or Agency.

      (b)  The standards and procedures in this part are applicable to all claims and debts for which a statute, regulation, or contract does not prescribe different standards or procedures.

      (c)  This part does not apply to USAID:

      (1) Claims arising out of loans for which compromise and collection authority is conferred by section 635(g)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended;

      (2) Claims arising from investment guaranty operations for which settlement and arbitration authority is conferred by section 635(l) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended;

      (3) Claims against any foreign country or any political subdivision thereof, or any public international organization;

      (4) Claims where the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) determines that the achievement of the purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or any other provision of law administered by USAID require a different course of action;

      (5) Claims owed USAID by other Federal Departments and Agencies. Such debts will be resolved by negotiation between the Departments/Agencies; and

      (6) Claims that appear to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party with an interest in the claim except to the extent provided in § 213.4.

      (s)  means any order for the withholding or garnishment of pay issued by USAID or a judicial or administrative body. For the purposes of this part, “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”

The OIG has the responsibility to provide the results of the investigation on a timely basis to the CFO for any further action.

      (b) The CFO will not administratively compromise, terminate, or suspend collection action, or otherwise dispose of a claim that appears to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party that has an interest in the claim, without the approval of DOJ.

#### § § 213.5

      USAID will not subdivide a claim to avoid the $100,000 limit on the Agency's authority to compromise a claim, suspend collection action on a claim, or terminate collection action on a claim. A debtor's liability that arises from a particular transaction or contract is a single claim.

#### § § 213.7

      (a) The CFO takes action to collect all debts owed the United States that arise out of USAID's activities, and to reduce debt delinquencies.

      § 213.8   Written demand for payment notice.

#### § § 213.8

      (a) When an Agency official determines that a debt is owed to USAID, the Agency sends a written demand for payment notice to the debtor. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, contract, or order, the written demand for payment notice informs the debtor of:

      (2) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy records related to the debt;

      (3) The right of the debtor to discuss and propose a repayment agreement;

      (4) Any rights available to the debtor to review the debt, or to have recovery of the debt waived (by citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or waiver request on the collection of the debt);

      (5) The date on which debt payment is due, which will be not more than 30 days from the date the written demand for-payment notice is mailed or hand delivered;

      (6) The instructions for making electronic payment;

      (7) The debt is considered delinquent if it is not paid on the due date provided in the initial written demand-of payment notice;

      (8) The imposition of interest charges, penalties, and administrative costs that USAID may assess against a delinquent debt, and the date when such charges apply;

      (9) The intention of USAID to use non-centralized administrative offset to collect the debt if appropriate and, if not, the referral of the debt 90 days after the Bill for Collection or demand letter to the Financial Management Service in the Department of Treasury who will collect their administrative costs from the debtor in addition to the amount owed USAID and use all means available to the Federal Government for debt collection including administrative wage garnishment, use of collection agencies and reporting the indebtedness to a credit reporting bureau (see § 213.14);

      (10) The Agency will refer delinquent debt unpaid at 90 days from the initial written demand for payment notice to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Statute requires the referral of delinquent debt to Fiscal Service no later than 120 days from the initial written demand-for-payment notice. Fiscal Service will use means available to the Federal Government for collecting a debt, including administrative wage-garnishment, the use of collection agencies, and reporting the indebtedness to a credit-reporting bureau (see § 213.15);

      (11) The address, telephone number, and name of the person available to discuss the debt; and

      § 213.9   Agency review requirements.

#### § § 213.9

      (a) For purposes of this section, whenever USAID must afford a debtor a review within the Agency, USAID shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for a review when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt in question. The review may include the examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials, and discussion by letter or orally with the debtor, at USAID's discretion. For the offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain debts, an employee may request an outside hearing. See §§ 213.21 and 213.22 when USAID is the creditor Agency.

      (b) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although USAID will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

      (c) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection in which the agency has determined that review of the written record is an adequate means to correct a prior mistake.

      (d) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, USAID shall accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

      (e) If, after review, USAID either sustains or amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect the sustained or amended debt. The notification to collect the sustained or amended debt will include accrued interest on the sustained or amended debt, calculated from the date of delinquency. If USAID has suspended collection actions previously, it will reinstitute them unless it receives payment of the sustained or amended amount, or the debtor has made a proposal for a payment plan to which the Agency agrees, by the date specified in the notification of USAID's decision.

#### § § 213.11

      (a)  USAID will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.

      (1) Interest begins to accrue on all delinquent debts starting from the day after the payment due date established in the initial written demand-for payment notice to the debtor. USAID will assess an annual rate of interest that is equal to the U.S. Department of the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) unless a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Federal Government. USAID will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.

      (2) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is executed.

      (3) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costs or late payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalties charges have been waived under the defaulted agreement, these charges can be reinstated and added to the debt principal under any new agreement and interest charged on the entire amount of the debt.

      (b)  The costs of the Agency's administrative handling of overdue debts including charges assessed by Treasury in cross-servicing USAID debts, based on either actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts except those owed by State and local governments and Indian tribes. These costs include both direct and indirect costs.

      (c)  As provided by 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), a penalty charge will be assessed on all debts, except those owned by State and local governments and Indian tribes, more than 90 days delinquent. The penalty charge will be at a rate not to exceed 6% per annum and will be assessed monthly.

      (d)  A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding administrative costs, second to penalty assessments, third to accrued interest and then to the outstanding debt principal.

      (e)  (1) The CFO will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The CFO may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by case basis, when he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Federal Government. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final, and is not subject to further review.

      (2) The CFO may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive the collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalties, or administrative costs, when he or she determines that—

      (i) A waiver is justified under the standards for the compromise of claims under § 213.25; or

      (ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of the United States.

      (3) The CFO may make a decision to waive interest, penalties, or administrative costs at any time.

      § 213.12   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs pending consideration of debt waiver or review.

#### § § 213.12

      Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue on a debt during a review by USAID and during a waiver of indebtedness consideration by the Agency; except that USAID will not assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs where a statute or a regulation specifically prohibits the collection of the debt during the period of the Agency's review or consideration of a debt waiver.

      § 213.13   Waivers of indebtedness.

#### § § 213.13

      The CFO may grant waivers of indebtedness for certain types of debt identified in Federal statutes under the following waiver authorities:

      (a) —(1)  Title 5 U.S.C. 5584 provides the authority for waiving, in whole or in part, debts that arise out of erroneous payments of pay or allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances to an employee of USAID, if collection would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States:

      (i) The CFO may not grant a waiver if there exists in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person who has an interest in obtaining a waiver.

      (ii) Fault is considered to exist if, in light of the circumstances, the employee knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, that an error existed, but he or she failed to take corrective action. What an employee should have known is evaluated under a reasonable-person standard. However, employees are expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them.

      (iii) An employee with notice that a payment might be erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventual repayment. Financial hardship is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an erroneous payment.

      (iv) If the deciding official finds no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person who has an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatically entitled to a waiver. Before granting a waiver, the deciding official also must determine that collection of the claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States, include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom the Agency seeks collection;

      (B) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the employee either has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of his or her financial circumstances;

      (C) The time elapsed between the erroneous payment and the discovery of the error and notification of the employee;

      (D) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee; and

      (E) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.

      (2)  Title 5 U.S.C. 5524a, 5522, or 5922 provide authority for waiving, in whole or in part, a debt that arises out of such an advance payment if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:

      (i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Death of the employee;

      (B) Retirement of the employee for disability;

      (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and

      (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (3)  Title 5 U.S.C. 4108 provides the authority for waiving, in whole or in part, a debt that arises out of employee training expenses if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:

      (i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of a debt that arises out of employee training expenses would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Death of the employee;

      (B) Retirement of the employee for disability;

      (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and

      (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (4)  Title 5 U.S.C. 8707(d) provides the authority for waiving the collection of unpaid deductions that result from the underwithholding of premiums under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program if the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:

      (i) Fault is considered to exist if, in light of the circumstances, the employee knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, that an error existed, but he or she failed to take corrective action:

      (ii) Factors to consider when determining whether the recovery of unpaid deduction that results from under-withholding would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the individual from whom the Agency seeks collection;

      (B) The time elapsed between the failure to withhold properly and the discovery of the failure and notification of the individual;

      (C) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the individual; and

      (D) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.

      (5)  Title 5 U.S.C. 5379 provides for waiving, in whole or in part, debt that arises from the Student Loan Repayment Program if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:

      (i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of a debt that arises out of the Student-Loan Repayment Program would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Death of the employee;

      (B) Retirement of the employee for disability;

      (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and

      (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      § 213.14   Contracting for collection services.

#### § § 213.14

      USAID has entered into a cross-servicing agreement with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Fiscal Service is authorized to take all appropriate action to enforce the collection of accounts referred to it in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Fiscal Service bases any applicable fees on the funds collected, and will collect such fees from the debtor along with the original amount of the indebtedness. After referral, Fiscal Service will be solely responsible for the maintenance of the delinquent debtor records in its possession, and for updating the accounts as necessary. Fiscal Service may take any of the following collection actions on USAID's behalf:

      (a) Send demand letters on U. S. Treasury letterhead and telephone debtors;

      (b) Refer accounts to credit bureaus;

      (c) Skiptracing;

      (d) Purchase credit reports to assist in the collection effort;

      (e) Refer accounts for offset, including tax refund, Federal employee salary, administrative wage garnishment, and general administrative offset under the Treasury Offset Program.

      (f) Refer accounts to private collection agencies;

      (g) Refer accounts to DOJ for litigation;

      (h) Report written off/discharged debts to IRS on the appropriate Form 1099;

      (i) Take any additional steps necessary to enforce recovery; and

      (j) Terminate collection action, as appropriate.

      § 213.15   Use of credit-reporting bureaus.

#### § § 213.15

      USAID reports delinquent debts owed to it to appropriate credit-reporting bureaus through the cross-servicing agreement with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

      (a) The following information is provided to the credit reporting bureaus:

      (1) A statement that the claim is valid and is overdue;

      (2) The name, address, taxpayer identification number and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor;

      (3) The amount, status and history of the debt; and

      (4) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.

      (b) Before referring claims to Fiscal Service and disclosing debt information to credit-reporting bureaus, USAID will have done the following:

      (1) Taken reasonable action to locate the debtor if a current address is not available; and

      (2) If a current address is available, notified the debtor in writing that:

      (i) The designated USAID official has reviewed the claim and has determined that it is valid and overdue;

      (ii) If the debtor does not pay the debt 90 days after receiving the initial written demand-for-payment notice, USAID intends to refer the debt to Fiscal Service and disclose to a credit-reporting agency the information authorized for disclosure by this subpart; and

      (iii) The debtor can request an Agency review or waiver, where applicable.

      (c) Before submitting information to a credit-reporting bureau, USAID will provide a written statement to Fiscal Service that the Agency has taken all required actions. Additionally, Fiscal Service thereafter will update the accounts as necessary during the period it holds the account information.

      § 213.16   Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

#### § § 213.16

      (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt, the CFO may obtain a debtor's current mailing address from the Internal Revenue Service.

      (b) Addresses obtained from the Internal Revenue Service will be used by the Agency, its officers, employees, agents or contractors and other Federal agencies only to collect or dispose of debts, and may be disclosed to other agencies and to collection agencies only for collection purposes.

      § 213.17   Liquidation of collateral.

#### § § 213.17

      Where the CFO holds a security instrument with a power of sale or has physical possession of collateral, he or she may liquidate the security or collateral and apply the proceeds to the overdue debt. USAID will exercise this right where the debtor fails to pay within a reasonable time after demand, unless the cost of disposing of the collateral is disproportionate to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure. However, collection from other businesses, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety or insurance company unless expressly required by contract or statute. The CFO will give the debtor reasonable notice of the sale and an accounting of any surplus proceeds and will comply with any other requirements of law or contract.

      § 213.18   Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guarantees, licenses or privileges.

#### § § 213.18

      Unless waived by the CFO, USAID will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan or loan guarantee to any person delinquent on a nontax debt owed to a Federal agency. USAID may also suspend or revoke licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure of a debtor to pay a claim. Additionally, the CFO may suspend or disqualify any contractor, lender, broker, borrower, grantee or other debtor from doing business with USAID or engaging in programs USAID sponsors or funds if a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time. Debtors will be notified before such action is taken and applicable suspension or debarment procedures will be used. The CFO will report the failure of any surety to honor its obligations to the Treasury Department for action under 31 CFR 332.18.

      § 213.19   Installment payments.

#### § § 213.19

      (a) Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties and administrative costs, as required by § 213.11, will be collected in a single payment. However, where the CFO determines that a debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in a single payment or that an alternative payment mechanism is in the best interest of the United States, the CFO may approve repayment of the debt in installments. The debtor has the burden of establishing that it is financially unable to pay the debt in a single payment or that an alternative payment mechanism is warranted. If the CFO agrees to accept payment by installments, the CFO may require a debtor to execute a written agreement which specifies all the terms of the repayment arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default. The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than 3 years, unless the CFO determines that a longer period is required. Installment payments of less than $50 per month generally will not be accepted, but may be accepted where the debtor's financial or other circumstances justify.

      (b) If a debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment payment is to be applied among the debts, that designation will be approved if the CFO determines that the designation is in the best interest of the United States. If the debtor does not designate how the payment is to be applied, the CFO will apply the payment to the various debts in accordance with the best interest of the United States, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

    Subpart C—Administrative and Salary Offset

      § 213.20   Administrative offset of non-employee debts.

#### § § 213.20

      This subpart provides for USAID's collection of debts by administrative offset under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, other statutory authorities and offsets or recoupments under common law. It does not apply to offsets against employee salaries covered by §§ 213.21, 213.22 and 213.23 of this subpart. USAID will collect debts by administrative offsets where it determines that such collections are feasible and are not otherwise prohibited by statute or contract. USAID will decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether collection by administrative offset is feasible and that its use furthers and protects the interest of the United States.

      (a)  (1) The CFO collects debts by administrative offset only after USAID has sent the debtor a written demand-for-payment notice that outlines the type and amount of the debt, the intention of the Agency to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and explaining the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716.

      (2) Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor has been given:

      (i) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;

      (ii) The opportunity for a review within USAID of the Agency's decision related to the claim(s); and

      (iii) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

      (3) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section may be omitted when:

      (i) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;

      (ii) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

      (iii) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (g) of this section, USAID first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, USAID shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the USAID.

      (4) When USAID previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt, USAID need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.

      (b)  The CFO may offset a debt owed to another Federal Department or Agency from amounts due or payable by USAID to the debtor, or may request another Federal Department or Agency to offset a debt owed to USAID. The CFO, through USAID's cross-servicing arrangement with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, may request the Internal Revenue Service to offset an overdue debt from a Federal income-tax refund due to the debtor. Fiscal Service may also garnish the salary of a private-sector employee when reasonable attempts to obtain payment have failed. USAID will make interagency offsets from an employee's salary in accordance with the procedures contained in §§ 213.22 and 213.23.

      (c)  The CFO may, at the CFO's discretion, enter into a repayment agreement with the debtor in lieu of offset. In deciding whether to accept payment of the debt by an alternative repayment agreement, the CFO may consider such factors as the amount of the debt, the length of the proposed repayment period, past Agency dealings with the debtor, documentation submitted by the debtor indicating that an offset will cause undue financial hardship, and the debtor's financial ability to adhere to the terms of a repayment agreement. The CFO may require financial documentation from the debtor before considering the repayment arrangement.

      (d)  (1) USAID will not offset the debt while a debtor is seeking review of the debt under this section, or under another statute, regulation, or contract. However, interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue during this period, unless otherwise waived by the CFO. The CFO may initiate offset as soon as practical after the completion of a review, or after a debtor waives the opportunity to request review.

      (2) The debtor must provide a written request for review of the decision to offset the debt no later than 15 days after the date of the notice of the offset unless a different time is specifically prescribed. The debtor's request must state the basis for the request for review.

      (3) The CFO may grant an extension of time for filing a request for review if the debtor shows good cause for the late filing. A debtor who fails timely to file or to request an extension waives the right to review.

      (4) The CFO will issue, no later than 60 days after the filing of the request, a written final decision based on the evidence, record and applicable law.

      (e)  Where moneys are available for offset against multiple debts of a debtor, it will be applied in accordance with the best interest of the Government as determined by the CFO on a case-by-case basis.

      (f)  (1) Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that creditor agencies conduct, at the agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor Agency  may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt.

      (2) Before requesting a payment authorizing agency to conduct a non-centralized administrative offset, USAID's regulations provides that such offsets may occur only after:

      (i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and

      (ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written certification from the creditor Agency that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor Agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.

      (3) USAID as a payment authorizing agency will comply with offset requests by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to USAID's program, or would otherwise be contrary to law.

      (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, USAID will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.

      (g)  Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (a) of this section, USAID may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      § 213.21   Employee salary offset—general.

#### § § 213.21

      (a)  This section establishes USAID's policies and procedures for recovery of debts owed to the United States by installment collection from the current pay account of an employee.

      (b)  The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed USAID and debts owed to other Federal Departments and Agencies by USAID's employees. USAID will make every effort reasonably and lawfully possible to collect administratively any amounts owed by its employees prior to initiating collection by salary offset. An amount advanced to an employee for per diem or mileage allowances in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, but not used for allowable travel expenses, is recoverable from the employee by salary offset without regard to the due-process provisions in § 213.22. This section does not apply to debts for which another statute collection explicitly provides for, or prohibits, salary offset (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee-training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108).

      (c)  The following statutes and regulations apply to USAID's recovery of debts due the United States by salary offset:

      (1) 5 U.S.C. 5514, as amended, governing the installment collection of debts;

      (2) 31 U.S.C. 3716, governing the liquidation of debts by administrative offset;

      (3) 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, setting forth the minimum requirements for executive agency regulations on salary offset; and

      (4) 31 CFR parts 900 through 904, the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

> [67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002, as amended at 86 FR 31144, June 11, 2021]

      § 213.22   Salary offset when USAID is the creditor Agency.

#### § § 213.22

      (a)  (1) Prior to initiating collection action through salary offset, USAID will first provide the employee with the opportunity to pay in full the amount owed, unless such notification will compromise the Government's ultimate ability to collect the debt.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each employee from whom the Agency proposes to collect a debt by salary offset under this section is entitled to receive a written notice as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) Each employee owing a debt to the United States that will be collected by salary offset is entitled to request a hearing on the debt. This request must be filed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. The Agency will make appropriate hearing arrangements that are consistent with law and regulations. Where a hearing is held, the employee is entitled to a written decision on the following issues:

      (i) The determination of the Agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt; and

      (ii) The repayment schedule, if it was not established by written agreement between the employee and the Agency.

      (b)  The procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not applicable to overpayments of pay or allowances caused by the following:

      (1) Any adjustment of pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program (such as health insurance) requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. However, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over more than four pay periods the full procedures prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section will be extended to the employee;

      (2) Routine intra-agency adjustment in pay or allowances that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred with the 4 pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment; or

      (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment.

      (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, deductions will not be made unless the employee is first provided with a minimum of 30 calendar days written notice. Notice will be sent by mail and must include the following:

      (1) The Agency's determination that a debt is owed, including the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

      (2) The Agency's intention to collect the debt by means of deductions from the employee's current disposable pay account;

      (3) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date and duration of the intended deductions. (The proposed beginning date for salary offset cannot be earlier than 30 days after the date of notice, unless this would compromise the Government's ultimate ability to resolve the debt);

      (4) An explanation of the requirements concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs;

      (5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records relating to the debt or to request and receive a copy of such records;

      (6) If not previously provided, the employee's right to enter into a written agreement for a repayment schedule differing from that proposed by the Agency where the terms of the proposed repayment schedule are acceptable to the Agency. (Such an agreement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate USAID official and will be included in the debt file);

      (7) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official not under the control of USAID, if a request is filed;

      (8) The method and time for requesting a hearing;

      (9) That the filing of a request for hearing within 15 days of receipt of the original notification will stay the assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, and the commencement of collection proceedings;

      (10) That a final decision on the hearing (if requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but no later than 60 days after the filing of the request, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

      (11) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the employee to—

      (i) Disciplinary procedures under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

      (ii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002 or other applicable statutory authority; or

      (iii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or any other applicable statutory authority;

      (12) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

      (13) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.

      (d)  An employee may request a hearing by filing a written, signed request to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, United States Agency for International Development, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, USAID Annex, Room 8.80D, Washington, DC 20523-4601. The request must state the basis upon which the employee disputes the proposed collection of the debt. The employee must sign the request, and USAID must receive it within 15 days of his or her receipt of the notification of proposed deductions. The employee should submit, in writing, all facts, evidence, and witnesses that support his or her position to the CFO within 15 days of the date of the request for a hearing. The CFO will arrange for the services of a hearing official not under the control of USAID, and will provide the hearing official with all documents relating to the claim.

      (e)  Late requests for a hearing may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay in filing the request for a hearing was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

      (f)  (1) Normally, a hearing will consist of the hearing official's making a decision based on a review of the claims file and any materials submitted by the debtor. However, in instances in which the hearing official determines that the validity of the debt turns on an issue of veracity or credibility that the review of documentary evidence cannot resolve, the hearing official, at his or her discretion, may afford the debtor an opportunity for an oral hearing. Such an oral hearing will consist of a conference before a hearing official in which the employee and the Agency will have the opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument. If desired, the employee may be represented by an individual of his or her choice. The Agency shall maintain a summary record of oral hearings provided under the procedures in this section.

      (2) Written decisions provided after a request for hearing will, at a minimum, state the facts evidencing the nature and origin of the alleged debt; and the hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions.

      (3) The decision of the hearing official is final and binding on the parties.

      (g)  In certain instances, an employee may have a statutory right to request a waiver of overpayment of pay or allowances (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 5 U.S.C. 5724(i)). When an employee requests waiver consideration under a right authorized by statute, the Agency will suspend further collection on the debt until it makes a final administrative decision on the waiver request. However, when it appears that an employee's resignation, termination, or other action may prejudice the Government's ability to recover the debt, the suspension of recovery is not required. During the period of the suspension, USAID will not assess interest, penalties, charges, and administrative costs against the debt. The Agency will not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the procedures already provided the debtor under a request for waiver. See § 213.13.

      (h)  A debt will be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions at established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Agency agree to alternative arrangements for payment. The alternative payment schedule must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the CFO and will be documented in the Agency's files.

      (i)  The size and frequency of installment deductions generally will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payments will be in amounts sufficient to liquidate the debt in three years or less. Installment payments of less than $50 normally will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

      (j)  If the employee is financially unable to pay a debt in a lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay, collection will be made in installments. Installment deductions will be made over the period of active duty or employment except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (k)  (1) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will begin on the date stated in the Agency's written demand-for-payment notice of intention to collect, from the employee's current pay unless he or she has paid the debt or filed a timely request for a hearing on issues for which a hearing is appropriate.

      (2) If the employee has filed a timely request for hearing with the Agency, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a final written decision indicating the amount owed the Government. Following the decision by the hearing official, the employee will be given 30 days to repay the amount owed prior to collection through salary offset, unless otherwise provided by the hearing official.

      (l)  If the employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.).

      (m)  If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due the employee on the date of separation, USAID will liquidate the debt, where appropriate, by administrative offset from later payments of any kind due the former employee (e.g., retirement pay). Such administrative offset will be taken in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 213.20.

      (n)  USAID will assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts collected under the procedures in this section. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue during the period that the debtor is seeking a review of the debt or requesting a waiver. The following guidelines apply to the assessment of these costs on debts collected by salary offset:

      (1) USAID will start to assess interest on all debts not collected by the payment due date specified in the initial written demand-for-payment notice. USAID will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.

      (2) Administrative costs will be assessed if the debt is referred to Treasury for cross-servicing.

      (3) Deductions by administrative offset normally begin prior to the time for assessment of a penalty. Therefore, USAID will not assess a penalty charge unless deductions occur more than 90 days from the due date in the initial written demand-for-payment notice.

      (o)  An employee's payment under protest of all or any portion of a debt does not waive any rights that the employee may have under either the procedures in this section or any other provision of law.

      (p)  USAID will promptly refund to the employee amounts paid or deducted pursuant to this section, the recovery of which is subsequently waived or otherwise found not owing to the United States. Refunds do not bear interest unless specifically authorized by law.

      (q)  USAID will not initiate salary offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known and could not have been known through the exercise of reasonable care by the Government official responsible for discovering and collecting such debts.

      § 213.23   Salary offset when USAID is not the creditor Agency.

#### § § 213.23

      (a) USAID will use salary offset against one of its employees that is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. Such a request must be accompanied by a certification by the requesting agency that the person owes the debt (including the amount) and that the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met. The creditor Agency must also advise USAID of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencement date of the first installment, if a date other than the next established pay period.

      (b)  Requests for salary offset must be sent to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, United States Agency for International Development, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, USAID Annex, Room 8.80D, Washington, DC 20523-4601.

      (c) —(1)  If USAID receives an improperly completed request, the requesting (creditor) Agency will be requested to supply the required information before any salary offset can be taken.

      (2)  If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) of this section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on the next established pay period. USAID will not review the merits of the creditor Agency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim form. USAID will not assess a handling or any other related charge to cover the cost of its processing the claim.

      (d) —(1)  If an employee begins separation action before USAID collects the total debt due the creditor Agency, the following actions will be taken:

      (i) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor Agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from USAID in accordance with § 213.22;

      (ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, USAID will certify to the creditor Agency and the employee the total amount of USAID's collection; and

      (iii) If USAID is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund, or other similar payments, it will provide such information to the creditor Agency so that it can file a certified claim against the payments.

      (2)  If an USAID employee transfers to another Federal agency before USAID collects the total amount due the creditor Agency, USAID will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. It is the responsibility of the creditor Agency to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new employing agency.

    Subpart D—Compromise of Claims

      § 213.24   General.

#### § § 213.24

      The CFO may compromise claims for money or property when the principal balance of a claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000. Where the claim exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests with DOJ. The CFO may reject an offer of compromise in any amount. DOJ's approval is not required if the Agency rejects a compromise offer. When the claim exceeds $100,000 and the CFO recommends acceptance of a compromise offer, he or she will refer the claim with his or her recommendation to DOJ for approval. The referral may be in the form of the Claims-Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the basis for USAID's recommendation. USAID refers compromise offers for claims in excess of $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, unless otherwise provided by DOJ's delegations or procedures.

> [86 FR 31145, June 11, 2021]

      § 213.25   Standards for the compromise of claims.

#### § § 213.25

      (a) The CFO may compromise a claim pursuant to this section if USAID cannot collect the full amount because:

      (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount of the debt within reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information;

      (2) The Federal Government is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings;

      (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount; or

      (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court;

      (b) In evaluating the debtor's inability to pay, the CFO may consider, among other factors, the following:

      (1) Age and health of the debtor;

      (2) Present and potential income;

      (3) Inheritance prospects;

      (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor;

      (5) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings; or

      (6) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Federal Government's ability to enforce collection;

      (c) The CFO may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a compromise to DOJ, where there is significant doubt concerning the Federal Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount of the claim, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases will fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal issues involved, considering fully the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary data required to support the Government's claim. In determining the litigative risks involved, USAID will give proportionate weight to the likely amount of court costs and attorney fees the Government could incur if it is unsuccessful in litigation;

      (d) The CFO may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a compromise to DOJ, if the cost of collection does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount of the debt. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, taking into consideration the time it will take to effect collection. Costs of collection might be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large claims. In determining whether the cost of collection justifies enforced collection of the full amount, USAID may consider the positive effect that enforced collection of the claim could have on the collection of other similar claims;

      (e) To assess the merits of a compromise offer, the CFO should obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, that shows the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expense; and

      (f) The CFO may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to enforcement, and to compel compliance, when he or she determines that accepting the offer will serve the Agency's enforcement policy adequately, in terms of deterrence and securing compliance (both present and future).

> [86 FR 31145, June 11, 2021]

      § 213.26   Payment of compromised claims.

#### § § 213.26

      The CFO normally will not approve a debtor's request to pay a compromised claim in installments. However, where the CFO determines that payment of a compromise by installments is necessary to effect collection, a debtor's request to pay in installments may be approved.

      § 213.27   Joint and several liability.

#### § § 213.27

      When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld against one debtor until the other or others pay their proportionate share. The amount of a compromise with one debtor is not precedent in determining compromises from other debtors who have been determined to be jointly and severally liable on the claim.

      § 213.28   Execution of releases.

#### § § 213.28

      Upon receipt of full payment of a claim or the amount compromised, USAID will prepare and execute a release on behalf of the United States. In the event a mutual release is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against USAID and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.

    Subpart E—Suspension or Termination of Collection Action

      § 213.29   Suspension—general.

#### § § 213.29

      The CFO may suspend or terminate the Agency's collection actions on a debt where the outstanding debt principal does not exceed $100,000. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ delegations or procedures, the CFO refers requests for suspension of debts exceeding $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, for approval. If prior to referral to DOJ, USAID determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the agency may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence. The CFO may waive the assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs during the period of the suspension. Suspension will be for an established time period and generally will be reviewed at least every six months to ensure the continued propriety of the suspension.

> [67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002, as amended at 86 FR 31145, June 11, 2021]

      § 213.30   Standards for suspension of collection action.

#### § § 213.30

      (a) The CFO may suspend collection action on a debt when:

      (1) The debtor cannot be located;

      (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

      (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

      (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, the CFO may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, and:

      (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

      (2) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the 10-year statute of limitations for administrative offsets; or

      (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.

      (c) The CFO will suspend collection activity during the time required for waiver consideration or administrative review prior to agency collection of a debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits USAID from collecting the debt during that time. The CFO will ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of his or her consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail.

      (d) The CFO may suspend collection activities on debts of $100,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review when there is no statutory requirement and he or she determines that:

      (1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);

      (2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; or

      (3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.

      (e) The CFO will decline to suspend collection when he or she determines that the request for waiver or administrative review is frivolous, or that the debtor made it primarily to delay collection.

      § 213.31   Termination—general.

#### § § 213.31

      The CFO may terminate collection actions including accrued interest, penalties and administrative costs, where the debt principal does not exceed $100,000. If the debt exceeds $100,000, USAID obtains the approval of DOJ in order to terminate further collection actions. Unless otherwise provided for by DOJ regulations or procedures, requests to terminate collection on debts in excess of $100,000 are referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, for approval.

#### § § 213.32

      The CFO may terminate collection action on a debt when he or she determines that:

      (a) The Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for available judicial remedies, the debtor's ability to pay, and the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law;

      (b) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security remaining to be liquidated, and the prospects of collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of the claim;

      (c) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed the amount recoverable;

      (d) The claim is determined to be legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

      (e) The evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to induce voluntary payment have failed; or

      (f) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

      § 213.33   Permitted actions after termination of collection activity.

#### § § 213.33

      Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. Termination does not preclude the agency from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

      (a) Selling the debt if the CFO determines that such sale is in the best interests of USAID;

      (b) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

      (c) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

      (d) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.

      § 213.34   Debts discharged in bankruptcy.

#### § § 213.34

      The CFO generally terminates collection activity on a debt discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. USAID may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. The CFO will seek legal advice by the Office of the USAID General Counsel if he or she believes that any claims or offsets might have survived the discharge of a debtor.

    Subpart F—Discharge of Indebtedness and Reporting Requirements

      § 213.35   Discharging indebtedness— general.

#### § § 213.35

      (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a close out of the debt), the CFO must take all appropriate steps to collect such debt, including (as applicable), the following:

      (1) Administrative offset;

      (2) Tax-refund offset;

      (3) Offset of Federal salary;

      (4) Referral to private collection contractors;

      (5) Referral to Federal Departments or Agencies that are operating a debt-collection center;

      (6) Reporting delinquencies to credit-reporting bureaus;

      (7) Garnishing the wages of a delinquent debtor; and

      (8) Litigation or foreclosure.

      (b) The CFO will make a determination that collection action is no longer warranted and request that litigation counsel release any liens of record that are securing the debt. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from the termination or suspension of collection activity, and the Internal Revenue Code might apply. When the CFO suspends or terminates collection action on a debt, the debt remains delinquent, and USAID may pursue further collection action at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When a debt is discharged in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited, and USAID must terminate debt-collection action.

      Upon discharge of indebtedness, USAID must report the discharged debt as income to the debtor to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. USAID may request Fiscal Service to file such a discharge debt report to the IRS on the Agency's behalf.

      (a) The CFO, through USAID's cross-servicing agreement with Fiscal Service and by direct action, refers to DOJ for litigation all claims on which the Federal Government has taken aggressive collection actions but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended, or terminated. USAID makes such referrals as early as possible, consistent with aggressive Agency collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ's regulations or procedures, USAID refers for litigation debts of more than $2,500 but less than $1 million to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility, as required by the instructions for the Claims-Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). USAID shall refer debts of more than $1 million to the Civil Division at DOJ.

      (b) The CFO will clearly indicate on the CCLR the actions the DOJ should take on the referred claim.

      § 213.38   Mandatory transfer of debts to Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service—general.

#### § § 213.38

      (a) USAID's procedures call for the transfer of legally enforceable debt to Fiscal Service 90 days from the date provided on the Agency's initial written demand-for-payment notice issued to the debtor. A debt is legally enforceable if the Agency has made a final determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. A debt is not considered legally enforceable for purposes of mandatory transfer to Fiscal Service if a debt is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation and collection action during the review process is prohibited.

      (b) Except as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, USAID will transfer any debt covered by this part that is more than 120 days delinquent to Fiscal Service for debt-collection services. A debt is considered 120 days delinquent for purposes of this section if it is 120 days past due and is legally enforceable.

      USAID is not required to transfer a debt to the Financial Management Service (FMS) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to § 214.37(b) during such period of time that the debt:

      (a) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

      (b) Is scheduled for sale;

      (c) Is at a private collection contractor;

      (d) Is at a debt collection center if the debt has been referred to a Treasury-designated debt collection center;

      (e) Is being collected by internal offset; or

      (f) Is covered by an exemption granted by Treasury.

#### § § 214.11

      Provisions governing the establishment and chartering of Advisory Committees are contained in section 9 of the Act and paragraph 6 of OMB Circular A-63. In summary, these requirements include the following:

      (a) Where establishment of an Advisory Committee is not specifically authorized by statute or by the President, the need for a new A.I.D. advisory committee is determined by the A.I.D.

    (2) Required under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);

    (3) For a routine use as defined in § 215.2;

    § 215.13   General exemptions.

#### § § 215.13

    (a) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), the Director or the Administrator may, where there is a compelling reason to do so, exempt a system of records within the Agency from any part of the Act, except subsections (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) thereof, if the system of records is maintained by the Agency or component thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, including police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, and the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional, probation, pardon, or parole authorities, and which consists of:

    (1) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation status;

    (2) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or

    (3) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.

    (b) Each notice of a system of records that is the subject of an exemption under this section will include a statement that the system has been exempted, the reasons therefore, and a reference to the  volume and page, where the exemption rule can be found.

    (c) The systems of records to be exempted under section (j)(2) of the Act, the provisions of the Act from which they are being exempted, and the justification for the exemptions, are set forth below:

    (1)  This system of records is to be exempted from sections (c) (3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2), and (3); (e) (4) (G), (H), and (I); (e) (5) and (8); (f), (g) and (h) of the Act. These exemptions are necessary to insure the proper functioning of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement procedures, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, to prevent interference with law enforcement proceeding, to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques, and to avoid the endangering the law enforcement personnel.

    (2)  This system is exempt from sections (c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2), and (3); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); (e)(5) and (8); (f), (g), and (h) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. These exemptions are necessary to insure the proper functioning of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to maintain the integrity of law enforcement procedures, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the evidentiary basis of possible enforcement actions, to prevent interference with law enforcement proceeding, to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques, to avoid endangering law enforcement personnel, to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering these sources, and to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants or persons for a given position or contract. Although the primary functions of USAID are not of a law enforcement nature, the mandate to ensure USAID funding is not purposefully or inadvertently used to provide support to entities or individuals deemed to be a risk to national security necessarily requires coordination with law enforcement and intelligence agencies as well as use of their information. Use of these agencies' information necessitates the conveyance of these other systems exemptions to protect the information as stated.

  PART 216—ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEDURES

### Part 216

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C.4332; 22 U.S.C. 2381.

**Source:** Source: 41 FR 26913, June 30, 1976, unless otherwise noted.

    § 216.1   Introduction.

#### § § 216.1

    (a)  In accordance with sections 118(b) and 621 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, (the FAA) the following general procedures shall be used by A.I.D. to ensure that environmental factors and values are integrated into the A.I.D. decision making process. These procedures also assign responsibility within the Agency for assessing the environmental effects of A.I.D.'s actions. These procedures are consistent with Executive Order 12114, issued January 4, 1979, entitled Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, and the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 ) (NEPA). They are intended to implement the requirements of NEPA as they effect the A.I.D. program.

    (b)  In the conduct of its mandate to help upgrade the quality of life of the poor in developing countries, A.I.D. conducts a broad range of activities. These activities address such basic problems as hunger, malnutrition, overpopulation, disease, disaster, deterioration of the environment and the natural resource base, illiteracy as well as the lack of adequate housing and transportation. Pursuant to the FAA, A.I.D. provides development assistance in the form of technical advisory services, research, training, construction and commodity support. In addition, A.I.D. conducts programs under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Pub. L. 480) that are designed to combat hunger, malnutrition and to facilitate economic development. Assistance programs are carried out under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State and in cooperation with the governments of sovereign states. Within this framework, it is A.I.D. policy to:

    (1) Ensure that the environmental consequences of A.I.D.-financed activities are identified and considered by A.I.D. and the host country prior to a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted;

    (2) Assist developing countries to strengthen their capabilities to appreciate and effectively evaluate the potential environmental effects of proposed development strategies and projects, and to select, implement and manage effective environmental programs;

    (3) Identify impacts resulting from A.I.D.'s actions upon the environment, including those aspects of the biosphere which are the common and cultural heritage of all mankind; and

    (4) Define environmental limiting factors that constrain development and identify and carry out activities that assist in restoring the renewable resource base on which sustained development depends.

    (c) —(1)  Regulations promulgated by the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) ( Volume 43, Number 230, November 29, 1978) under the authority of NEPA and Executive Order 11514, entitled Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality (March 5, 1970) as amended by Executive Order 11991 (May 24, 1977).

    (2)  An Initial Environmental Examination is the first review of the reasonably foreseeable effects of a proposed action on the environment. Its function is to provide a brief statement of the factual basis for a Threshold Decision as to whether an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement will be required.

    (3)  A formal Agency decision which determines, based on an Initial Environmental Examination, whether a proposed Agency action is a major action significantly affecting the environment.

    (4)  A detailed study of the reasonably forseeable significant effects, both beneficial and adverse, of a proposed action on the environment of a foreign country or countries.

    (5)  A detailed study of the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts, both positive and negative, of a proposed A.I.D. action and its reasonable alternatives on the United States, the global environment or areas outside the jurisdiction of any nation as described in § 216.7 of these procedures. It is a specific document having a definite format and content, as provided in NEPA and the CEQ Regulations. The required form and content of an Environmental Impact Statement is further described in § 216.7 infra.

    (6)  An internal A.I.D. document which initially identifies and describes a proposed project.

    (7)  An internal A.I.D. document used to initiate and identify proposed non-project assistance, including commodity import programs. It is analogous to the PID.

    (8)  An internal A.I.D. document which provides a definitive description and appraisal of the project and particularly the plan or implementation.

    (9)  An internal A.I.D. document approving non-project assistance. It is analogous to the PP.

    (10)  The term environment, as used in these procedures with respect to effects occurring outside the United States, means the natural and physical environment. With respect to effects occurring within the United States see § 216.7(b).

    (11)  With respect to effects on the environment outside the United States, a proposed action has a significant effect on the environment if it does significant harm to the environment.

    (12)  For purposes of these procedures, A.I.D. is a minor donor to a multidonor project when A.I.D. does not control the planning or design of the multidonor project and either (i) A.I.D.'s total contribution to the project is both less than $1,000,000 and less than 25 percent of the estimated project cost, or (ii) A.I.D.'s total contribution is more than $1,000,000 but less than 25 percent of the estimated project cost and the environmental procedures of the donor in control of the planning of design of the project are followed, but only if the A.I.D. Environmental Coordinator determines that such procedures are adequate.

    § 216.2   Applicability of procedures.

#### § § 216.2

    (a)  Except as provided in § 216.2(b), these procedures apply to all new projects, programs or activities authorized or approved by A.I.D. and to substantive amendments or extensions of ongoing projects, programs, or activities.

    (b)  (1) Projects, programs or activities involving the following are exempt from these procedures:

    (i) International disaster assistance;

    (ii) Other emergency circumstances; and

    (iii) Circumstances involving exceptional foreign policy sensitivities.

    (2) A formal written determination, including a statement of the justification therefore, is required for each project, program or activity for which an exemption is made under paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, but is not required for projects, programs or activities under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The determination shall be made either by the Assistant Administrator having responsibility for the program, project or activity, or by the Administrator, where authority to approve financing has been reserved by the Administrator. The determination shall be made after consultation with CEQ regarding the environmental consequences of the proposed program, project or activity.

    (c)  (1) The following criteria have been applied in determining the classes of actions including in § 216.2(c)(2) for which an Initial Environmental Examination, Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Statement generally are not required;

    § 216.3   Procedures.

#### § § 216.3

    (a) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided, an Initial Environmental Examination is not required for activities identified in § 216.2(b)(1), (c) (2), and (d). For all other A.I.D. activities described in § 216.2(a) an Initial Environmental Examination will be prepared by the originator of an action. Except as indicated in this section, it should be prepared with the PID or PAIP. For projects including the procurement or use of pesticides, the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section will be followed, in addition to the procedures in this paragraph. Activities which cannot be identified in sufficient detail to permit the completion of an Initial Environmental Examination with the PID or PAIP, shall be described by including with the PID or PAIP: (i) An explanation indicating why the Initial Environmental Examination cannot be completed; (ii) an estimate of the amount of time required to complete the Initial Environmental Examination; and (iii) a recommendation that a Threshold Decision be deferred until the Initial Environmental Examination is completed. The responsible Assistant Administrator will act on the request for deferral concurrently with action on the PID or PAIP and will designate a time for completion of the Initial Environmental Examination. In all instances, except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, this completion date will be in sufficient time to allow for the completion of an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, if required, before a final decision is made to provide A.I.D. funding for the action.

    (2)  (i) The Initial Environmental Examination will include a Threshold Decision made by the officer in the originating office who signs the PID or PAIP. If the Initial Environmental Examination is completed prior to or at the same time as the PID or PAIP, the Threshold Decision will be reviewed by the Bureau Environmental Officer concurrently with approval of the PID or PAIP. The Bureau Environmental Officer will either concur in the Threshold Decision or request reconsideration by the officer who made the Threshold Decision, stating the reasons for the request. Differences of opinion between these officers shall be submitted for resolution to the Assistant Administrator at the same time that the PID is submitted for approval.

    (ii) An Initial Environmental Examination, completed subsequent to approval of the PID or PAIP, will be forwarded immediately together with the Threshold Determination to the Bureau Environmental Officer for action as described in this section.

    (iii) A Positive Threshold Decision shall result from a finding that the proposed action will have a significant effect on the environment. An Environmental Impact Statement shall be prepared if required pursuant to § 216.7. If an impact statement is not required, an Environmental Assessment will be prepared in accordance with § 216.6. The cognizant Bureau or Office will record a Negative Determination if the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the environment.

    (3)  The Assistant Administrator, or the Administrator in actions for which the approval of the Administrator is required for the authorization of financing, may make a Negative Declaration, in writing, that the Agency will not develop an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement regarding an action found to have a significant effect on the environment when (i) a substantial number of Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements relating to similar activities have been prepared in the past, if relevant to the proposed action, (ii) the Agency has previously prepared a programmatic Statement or Assessment covering the activity in question which has been considered in the development of such activity, or (iii) the Agency has developed design criteria for such an action which, if applied in the design of the action, will avoid a significant effect on the environment.

    (4) —(i)  After a Positive Threshold Decision has been made, or a determination is made under the pesticide procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement is required, the originator of the action shall commence the process of identifying the significant issues relating to the proposed action and of determining the scope of the issues to be addressed in the Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement. The originator of an action within the classes of actions described in § 216.2(d) shall commence this scoping process as soon as practicable. Persons having expertise relevant to the environmental aspects of the proposed action shall also participate in this scoping process. (Participants may include but are not limited to representatives of host governments, public and private institutions, the A.I.D. Mission staff and contractors.) This process shall result in a written statement which shall include the following matters:

    () A determin_a_tion of the scope and significance of issues to be analyzed in the Environmental Assessment or Impact Statement, including direct and indirect effects of the project on the environment.

    () Identification and elimination from detailed study of the issues that are not significant or have _b_een covered by earlier environmental review, or approved design considerations, narrowing the discussion of these issues to a brief presentation of why they will not have a significant effect on the environment.

    () A des_c_ription of () the timing of the preparation of environmental analyses, including phasing if appropriate, () variations required in the format of the Environmental Assessment, and () the tentative planning and decision making schedule; and

    () A _d_escription of how the analysis will be conducted and the disciplines that will participate in the analysis.

    (ii) These written statements shall be reviewed and approved by the Bureau Environmental Officer.

    (iii)  To assist in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment, the Bureau Environmental Office may circulate copies of the written statement, together with a request for written comments, within thirty days, to selected federal agencies if that Officer believes comments by such federal agencies will be useful in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment. Comments received from reviewing federal agencies will be considered in the preparation of the Environmental Assessment and in the formulation of the design and implementation of the project, and will, together with the scoping statement, will be included in the project file.

    (iv)  If it becomes evident that the action will not have a significant effect on the environment (, will not cause significant harm to the environment), the Positive Threshold Decision may be withdrawn with the concurrence of the Bureau Environmental Officer. In the case of an action included in § 216.2(d)(2), the request for withdrawal shall be made to the Bureau Environmental Officer.

    (5)  If the PID or PAIP is approved, and the Threshold Decision is positive, or the action is included in § 216.2(d), the originator of the action will be responsible for the preparation of an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement as required. Draft Environmental Impact Statements will be circulated for review and comment as part of the review of Project Papers and as outlined further in § 216.7 of those procedures. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, final approval of the PP or PAAD and the method of implementation will include consideration of the Environmental Assessment of final Environmental Impact Statement.

    (6)  (i) Initial Environmental Examinations, Environmental Assessments and final Environmental Impact Statements will be processed pursuant to standard A.I.D. procedures for project approval documents. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, Environmental Assessments and final Environmental Impact Statements will be reviewed as an integral part of the Project Paper or equivalent document. In addition to these procedures, Environmental Assessments will be reviewed and cleared by the Bureau Environmental Officer. They may also be reviewed by the Agency's Environmental Coordinator who will monitor the Environmental Assessment process.

    (ii) When project approval authority is delegated to field posts, Environmental Assessments shall be reviewed and cleared by the Bureau Environmental Officer prior to the approval of such actions.

    (iii) Draft and final Environmental Impact Statements will be reviewed and cleared by the Environmental Coordinator and the Office of the General Counsel.

    (7)  (i) Environmental review may be performed after authorization of a project, program or activity only with respect to subprojects or significant aspects of the project, program or activity that are unidentified at the time of authorization. Environmental review shall be completed prior to authorization for all subprojects and aspects of a project, program or activity that are identified.

    (ii) Environmental review should occur at the earliest time in design or implementation at which a meaningful review can be undertaken, but in no event later than when previously unidentified subprojects or aspects of projects, programs or activities are identified and planned. To the extent possible, adequate information to undertake deferred environmental review should be obtained before funds are obligated for unidentified subprojects or aspects of projects, programs or activities. (Funds may be obligated for the other aspects for which environmental review has been completed.) To avoid an irreversible commitment of resources prior to the conclusion of environmental review, the obligation of funds can be made incrementally as subprojects or aspects of projects, programs or activities are identified; or if necessary while planning continues, including environmental review, the agreement or other document obligating funds may contain appropriate convenants or conditions precedent to disbursement for unidentified subprojects or aspects of projects, programs or activities.

    (iii) When environmetal review must be deferred beyond the time some of the funds are to be disbursed (e.g. long lead times for the delivery of goods or services), the project agreement or other document obligating funds shall contain a covenant or covenants requiring environmental review, including an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, when appropriate, to be completed and taken into account prior to implementation of those subprojects or aspects of the project, program or activity for which environmental review is deferred. Such convenants shall ensure that implementation plans will be modified in accordance with environmental review if the parties decide that modifications are necessary.

    (iv) When environmental review will not be completed for an entire project, program or activity prior to authorization, the Initial Environmental Examination and Threshold Decision required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall identify those aspects of the project, program or activity for which environmental review will be completed prior to the time financing is authorized. It shall also include those subprojects or aspects for which environmental review will be deferred, stating the reasons for deferral and the time when environmental review will be completed. Further, it shall state how an irreversible commitment of funds will be avoided until environmental review is completed. The A.I.D. officer responsible for making environmental decisions for such projects, programs or activities shall also be identified (the same officer who has decision making authority for the other aspects of implementation). This deferral shall be reviewed and approved by the officer making the Threshold Decision and the officer who authorizes the project, program or activity. Such approval may be made only after consultation with the Office of General Counsel for the purpose of establishing the manner in which conditions precedent to disbursement or covenants in project and other agreements will avoid an irreversible commitment of resources before environmental review is completed.

    (8)  To the extent feasible and relevant, projects and programs for which Environmental Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments have been prepared should be designed to include measurement of any changes in environmental quality, positive or negative, during their implementation. This will require recording of baseline data at the start. To the extent that available data permit, originating offices of A.I.D. will formulate systems in collaboration with recipient nations, to monitor such impacts during the life of A.I.D.'s involvement. Monitoring implementation of projects, programs and activities shall take into account environmental impacts to the same extent as other aspects of such projects, programs and activities. If during implementation of any project, program or activity, whether or not an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement was originally required, it appears to the Mission Director, or officer responsible for the project, program or activity, that it is having or will have a significant effect on the environment that was not previously studied in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, the procedures contained in this part shall be followed including, as appropriate, a Threshold Decision, Scoping and an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.

    (9)  If, after a Threshold Decision is made resulting in a Negative Determination, a project is revised or new information becomes available which indicates that a proposed action might be “major” and its effects “significant”, the Negative Determination will be reviewed and revised by the cognizant Bureau and an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared, if appropriate. Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements will be amended and processed appropriately if there are major changes in the project or program, or if significant new information becomes available which relates to the impact of the project, program or activity on the environment that was not considered at the time the Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement was approved. When on-going programs are revised to incorporate a change in scope or nature, a determination will be made as to whether such change may have an environmental impact not previously assessed. If so, the procedures outlined in this part will be followed.

    (10)  These procedures refer to certain A.I.D. documents such as PIDs, PAIPs, PPs and PAADs as the A.I.D. internal instruments for approval of projects, programs or activities. From time to time, certain special procedures, such as those in § 216.4, may not require the use of the aforementioned documents. In these situations, these environmental procedures shall apply to those special approval procedures, unless otherwise exempt, at approval times and levels comparable to projects, programs and activities in which the aforementioned documents are used.

    (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, all proposed projects involving assistance for the procurement or use, or both, of pesticides shall be subject to the procedures prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section. These procedures shall also apply, to the extent permitted by agreements entered into by A.I.D. before the effective date of these pesticide procedures, to such projects that have been authorized but for which pesticides have not been procured as of the effective date of these pesticide procedures.

    (i) When a project includes assistance for procurement or use, or both, of pesticides registered for the same or similar uses by USEPA without restriction, the Initial Environmental Examination for the project shall include a separate section evaluating the economic, social and environmental risks and benefits of the planned pesticide use to determine whether the use may result in significant environmental impact. Factors to be considered in such an evaluation shall include, but not be limited to the following:

    () The USEPA registr_a_tion status of the requested pesticide;

    () The _b_asis for selection of the requested pesticide;

    () The extent to whi_c_h the proposed pesticide use is part of an integrated pest management program;

    () The propose_d_ method or methods of application, including availability of appropriate application and safety equipment;

    () Any acut_e_ and long-term toxicological hazards, either human or environmental, associated with the proposed use and measures available to minimize such hazards;

    () The e_f_fectiveness of the requested pesticide for the proposed use;

    () Compatibility of the proposed pesticide with tar_g_et and nontarget ecosystems;

    () T_h_e conditions under which the pesticide is to be used, including climate, flora, fauna, geography, hydrology, and soils;

    () The ava_i_lability and effectiveness of other pesticides or nonchemical control methods;

    () The requesting country's ability to regulate or control the distribution, storage, use and disposal of the requested pesticide;

    () The provisions made for training of users and applicators; and

    () The provisions made for monitoring the use and effectiveness of the pesticide.

    (ii) When a project includes assistance for the procurement or use, or both, of any pesticide registered for the same or similar uses in the United States but the proposed use is restricted by the USEPA on the basis of user hazard, the procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be followed. In addition, the Initial Environmental Examination will include an evaluation of the user hazards associated with the proposed USEPA restricted uses to ensure that the implementation plan which is contained in the Project Paper incorporates provisions for making the recipient government aware of these risks and providing, if necessary, such technical assistance as may be required to mitigate these risks. If the proposed pesticide use is also restricted on a basis other than user hazard, the procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section shall be followed in lieu of the procedures in this section.

    (iii) If the project includes assistance for the procurement or use, or both of:

    () Any pesticide other th_a_n one registered for the same or similar uses by USEPA without restriction or for restricted use on the basis of user hazard; or

    () Any pesticide for which a notice of re_b_uttable presumption against re- registration, notice of intent to cancel, or notice of intent to suspend has been issued by USEPA.

    (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, if the project includes assistance for the procurement or use, or both, of a pesticide against which USEPA has initiated a regulatory action for cause, or for which it has issued a notice of rebuttable presumption against reregistration, the nature of the action or notice, including the relevant technical and scientific factors will be discussed with the requesting government and considered in the IEE and, if prepared, in the EA or EIS. If USEPA initiates any of the regulatory actions above against a pesticide subsequent to its evaluation in an IEE, EA or EIS, the nature of the action will be discussed with the recipient government and considered in an amended IEE or amended EA or EIS, as appropriate.

    (v) If the project includes assistance for the procurement or use, or both of pesticides but the specific pesticides to be procured or used cannot be identified at the time the IEE is prepared, the procedures outlined in paragraphs (b) (i) through (iv) of this section will be followed when the specific pesticides are identified and before procurement or use is authorized. Where identification of the pesticides to be procured or used does not occur until after Project Paper approval, neither the procurement nor the use of the pesticides shall be undertaken unless approved, in writing, by the Assistant Administrator (or in the case of projects authorized at the Mission level, the Mission Director) who approved the Project Paper.

    (2)  The procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to the following projects including assistance for the procurement or use, or both, of pesticides.

    (i) Projects under emergency conditions.

    () A pest outbre_a_k has occurred or is imminent; and

    () Significant health pro_b_lems (either human or animal) or significant economic problems will occur without the prompt use of the proposed pesticide; and

    () Insuffi_c_ient time is available before the pesticide must be used to evaluate the proposed use in accordance with the provisions of this regulation.

    (ii) Projects where A.I.D. is a minor donor, as defined in § 216.1(c)(12) of this part, to a multi-donor project.

    (iii) Projects including assistance for procurement or use, or both, of pesticides for research or limited field evaluation purposes by or under the supervision of project personnel. In such instances, however, A.I.D. will ensure that the manufacturers of the pesticides provide toxicological and environmental data necessary to safeguard the health or research personnel and the quality of the local environment in which the pesticides will be used. Furthermore, treated crops will not be used for human or animal consumption unless appropriate tolerances have been established by EPA or recommended by FAO/WHO, and the rates and frequency of application, together with the prescribed preharvest intervals, do not result in residues exceeding such tolerances. This prohibition does not apply to the feeding of such crops to animals for research purposes.

    (3)  In a very few limited number of circumstances A.I.D. may provide non-project assistance for the procurement and use of pesticides. Assistance in such cases shall be provided if the A.I.D. Administrator determines in writing that (i) emergency conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section exists; or (ii) that compelling circumstances exist such that failure to provide the proposed assistance would seriously impede the attainment of U.S. foreign policy objectives or the objectives of the foreign assistance program. In the latter case, a decision to provide the assistance will be based to the maximum extent practicable, upon a consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and, to the extent available, the history of efficacy and safety covering the past use of the pesticide the in recipient country.

    § 216.4   Private applicants.

#### § § 216.4

    Programs, projects or activities for which financing from A.I.D. is sought by private applicants, such as PVOs and educational and research institutions, are subject to these procedures. Except as provided in § 216.2 (b), (c) or (d), preliminary proposals for financing submitted by private applicants shall be accompanied by an Initial Environmental Examination or adequate information to permit preparation of an Initial Environmental Examination. The Threshold Decision shall be made by the Mission Director for the country to which the proposal relates, if the preliminary proposal is submitted to the A.I.D. Mission, or shall be made by the officer in A.I.D. who approves the preliminary proposal. In either case, the concurrence of the Bureau Environmental Officer is required in the same manner as in § 216.3(a)(2), except for PVO projects approved in A.I.D. Missions with total life of project costs less than $500,000. Thereafter, the same procedures set forth in § 216.3 including as appropriate scoping and Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements, shall be applicable to programs, projects or activities submitted by private applicants. The final proposal submitted for financing shall be treated, for purposes of these procedures, as a Project Paper. The Bureau Environmental Officer shall advise private applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for action by A.I.D.

    § 216.5   Endangered species.

#### § § 216.5

    It is A.I.D. policy to conduct its assistance programs in a manner that is sensitive to the protection of endangered or threatened species and their critical habitats. The Initial Environmental Examination for each project, program or activity having an effect on the environment shall specifically determine whether the project, program or activity will have an effect on an endangered or threatened species, or critical habitat. If the proposed project, program or activity will have the effect of jeopardizing an endangered or threatened species or of adversely modifying its critical habitat, the Threshold Decision shall be a Positive Determination and an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement completed as appropriate, which shall discuss alternatives or modifications to avoid or mitigate such impact on the species or its habitat.

> [45 FR 70247, Oct. 23, 1980]

    § 216.6   Environmental assessments.

#### § § 216.6

    (a)  The purpose of the Environmental Assessment is to provide Agency and host country decision makers with a full discussion of significant environmental effects of a proposed action. It includes alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse effects or enhance the quality of the environment so that the expected benefits of development objectives can be weighed against any adverse impacts upon the human environment or any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources.

    (b)  Collaboration in obtaining data, conducting analyses and considering alternatives will help build an awareness of development associated environmental problems in less developed countries as well as assist in building an indigenous institutional capability to deal nationally with such problems. Missions, Bureaus and Offices will collaborate with affected countries to the maximum extent possible, in the development of any Environmental Assessments and consideration of environmental consequences as set forth therein.

    (c)  The Environmental Assessment shall be based upon the scoping statement and shall address the following elements, as appropriate:

    (1)  The summary shall stress the major conclusions, areas of controversy, if any, and the issues to be resolved.

    (2)  The Environmental Assessment shall briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the Agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.

    (3)  This section should present the environmental impacts of the proposal and its alternatives in comparative form, thereby sharpening the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decision maker. This section should explore and evaluate reasonable alternatives and briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating those alternatives which were not included in the detailed study; devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits; include the alternative of no action; identify the Agency's preferred alternative or alternatives, if one or more exists; include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.

    (4)  The Environmental Assessment shall succinctly describe the environment of the area(s) to be affected or created by the alternatives under consideration. The descriptions shall be no longer than is necessary to understand the effects of the alternatives. Data and analyses in the Environmental Assessment shall be commensurate with the significance of the impact with less important material summarized, consolidated or simply referenced.

    (5)  This section forms the analytic basis for the comparisons under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. It will include the environmental impacts of the alternatives including the proposed action; any adverse effects that cannot be avoided should the proposed action be implemented; the relationship between short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposal should it be implemented. It should not duplicate discussions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This section of the Environmental Assessment should include discussions of direct effects and their significance; indirect effects and their significance; possible conflicts between the proposed action and land use plans, policies and controls for the areas concerned; energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures; natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various requirements and mitigation measures; urban quality; historic and cultural resources and the design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures; and means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.

    (6)  The Environmental Assessment shall list the names and qualifications (expertise, experience, professional discipline) of the persons primarily responsible for preparing the Environmental Assessment or significant background papers.

    (7)  An appendix may be prepared.

    (d)  Program Assessments may be appropriate in order to assess the environmental effects of a number of individual actions and their cumulative environmental impact in a given country or geographic area, or the environmental impacts that are generic or common to a class of agency actions, or other activities which are not country-specific. In these cases, a single, programmatic assessment will be prepared in A.I.D./Washington and circulated to appropriate overseas Missions, host governments, and to interested parties within the United States. To the extent practicable, the form and content of the programmatic Environmental Assessment will be the same as for project Assessments. Subsequent Environmental Assessments on major individual actions will only be necessary where such follow-on or subsequent activities may have significant environmental impacts on specific countries where such impacts have not been adequately evaluated in the programmatic Environmental Assessment. Other programmatic evaluations of classes of actions may be conducted in an effort to establish additional categorical exclusions or design standards or criteria for such classes that will eliminate or minimize adverse effects of such actions, enhance the environmental effect of such action or reduce the amount of paperwork or time involved in these procedures. Programmatic evaluations conducted for the purpose of establishing additional categorical exclusions under § 216.2(c) or design considerations that will eliminate significant effects for classes of actions shall be made available for public comment before the categorical exclusions or design standards or criteria are adopted by A.I.D. Notice of the availability of such document shall be published in the  Additional categorical exclusions shall be adopted by A.I.D. upon the approval of the Administrator, and design consideration in accordance with usual agency procedures.

    (e)  (1) When Environmental Assessments are prepared on activities carried out within or focused on specific developing countries, consultation will be held between A.I.D. staff and the host government both in the early stages of preparation and on the results and significance of the completed Assessment before the project is authorized.

    (2) Missions will encourage the host government to make the Environmental Assessment available to the general public of the recipient country. If Environmental Assessments are prepared on activities which are not country-specific, the Assessment will be circulated by the Environmental Coordinator to A.I.D.'s Overseas Missions and interested governments for information, guidance and comment and will be made available in the U.S. to interested parties.

    (f)  In a situation where an analysis indicates that potential effects may extend beyond the national boundaries of a recipient country and adjacent foreign nations may be affected, A.I.D. will urge the recipient country to consult with such countries in advance of project approval and to negotiate mutually acceptable accommodations.

    (g)  Environmental Assessments will not normally include classified or administratively controlled material. However, there may be situations where environmental aspects cannot be adequately discussed without the inclusion of such material. The handling and disclosure of classified or administratively controlled material shall be governed by 22 CFR part 9. Those portions of an Environmental Assessment which are not classified or administratively controlled will be made available to persons outside the Agency as provided for in 22 CFR part 212.

    § 216.7   Environmental impact statements.

#### § § 216.7

    (a)  An Environmental Impact Statement shall be prepared when agency actions significantly affect:

    (1) The global environment or areas outside the jurisdiction of any nation (e.g., the oceans);

    (2) The environment of the United States; or

    (3) Other aspects of the environment at the discretion of the Administrator.

    (b)  An Environmental Impact Statement relating to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall comply with the CEQ Regulations. With respect to effects on the United States, the terms environment and significant effect wherever used in these procedures have the same meaning as in the CEQ Regulations rather than as defined in § 216.1(c) (12) and (13) of these procedures.

    (c)  An Environmental Impact Statement relating to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section will generally follow the CEQ Regulations, but will take into account the special considerations and concerns of A.I.D. Circulation of such Environmental Impact Statements in draft form will precede approval of a Project Paper or equivalent and comments from such circulation will be considered before final project authorization as outlined in § 216.3 of these procedures. The draft Environmental Impact Statement will also be circulated by the Missions to affected foreign governments for information and comment. Draft Environmental Impact Statements generally will be made available for comment to Federal agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved, and to public and private organizations and individuals for not less than forty-five (45) days. Notice of availability of the draft Environmental Impact Statements will be published in the  Cognizant Bureaus and Offices will submit these drafts for circulation through the Environmental Coordinator who will have the responsibility for coordinating all such communications with persons outside A.I.D. Any comments received by the Environmental Coordinator will be forwarded to the originating Bureau or Office for consideration in final policy decisions and the preparation of a final Environmental Impact Statement. All such comments will be attached to the final Statement, and those relevant comments not adequately discussed in the draft Environmental Impact Statement will be appropriately dealt with in the final Environmental Impact Statement. Copies of the final Environmental Impact Statement, with comments attached, will be sent by the Environmental Coordinator to CEQ and to all other Federal, state, and local agencies and private organizations that made substantive comments on the draft, including affected foreign governments. Where emergency circumstances or considerations of foreign policy make it necessary to take an action without observing the provisions of § 1506.10 of the CEQ Regulations, or when there are overriding considerations of expense to the United States or foreign governments, the originating Office will advise the Environmental Coordinator who will consult with Department of State and CEQ concerning appropriate modification of review procedures.

    § 216.8   Public hearings.

#### § § 216.8

    (a) In most instances AID will be able to gain the benefit of public participation in the impact statement process through circulation of draft statements and notice of public availability in CEQ publications. However, in some cases the Administrator may wish to hold public hearings on draft Environmental Impact Statements. In deciding whether or not a public hearing is appropriate, Bureaus in conjunction with the Environmental Coordinator should consider:

    (1) The magnitude of the proposal in terms of economic costs, the geographic area involved, and the uniqueness or size of commitment of the resources involved;

    (2) The degree of interest in the proposal as evidenced by requests from the public and from Federal, state and local authorities, and private organizations and individuals, that a hearing be held;

    (3) The complexity of the issue and likelihood that information will be presented at the hearing which will be of assistance to the Agency; and

    (4) The extent to which public involvement already has been achieved through other means, such as earlier public hearings, meetings with citizen representatives, and/or written comments on the proposed action.

    (b) If public hearings are held, draft Environmental Impact Statements to be discussed should be made available to the public at least fifteen (15) days prior to the time of the public hearings, and a notice will be placed in the  giving the subject, time and place of the proposed hearings.

    § 216.9   Bilateral and multilateral studies and concise reviews of environmental issues.

#### § § 216.9

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these procedures, the Administrator may approve the use of either of the following documents as a substitute for an Environmental Assessment (but not a substitute for an Environmental Impact Statement) required under these procedures:

    (a) Bilateral or multilateral environmental studies, relevant or related to the proposed action, prepared by the United States and one or more foreign countries or by an international body or organization in which the United States is a member or participant; or

    (b) Concise reviews of the environmental issues involved including summary environmental analyses or other appropriate documents.

    § 216.10   Records and reports.

#### § § 216.10

    Each Agency Bureau will maintain a current list of activities for which Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements are being prepared and for which Negative Determinations and Declarations have been made. Copies of final Initial Environmental Examinations, scoping statements, Assessments and Impact Statements will be available to interested Federal agencies upon request. The cognizant Bureau will maintain a permanent file (which may be part of its normal project files) of Environmental Impact Statements, Environmental Assessments, final Initial Environmental Examinations, scoping statements, Determinations and Declarations which will be available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Interested persons can obtain information or status reports regarding Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements through the A.I.D. Environmental Coordinator.

      § 217.4   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 217.4

      (a)  No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.

      (b)  (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:

      (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

      (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

      (iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others;

      (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

      (v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefits, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;

      (vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

      (vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.

      (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.

      (3) Despite the existence of separate or different programs or activities provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in such aid, benefits, or service that are not separate or different.

      (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.

      (5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections (i) that have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance or (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.

      (6) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.

      (c)  The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services program limited by Federal statute or executive order to handicapped persons or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from aid, benefits or services limited by Federal statute or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this part.

      § 217.5   Assurances required.

#### § § 217.5

      (a)  An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified by the Administrator, that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to the Agency.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

      (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

      (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

      (c)  (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Agency the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.

      (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.

      (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Agency the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Agency to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Administrator may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

      § 217.6   Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.

#### § § 217.6

      (a)  (1) If the Administrator finds that a recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action as the Administrator deems necessary to overcome the effects of the discrimination.

      (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, the Administrator, where appropriate, may require either or both recipients to take remedial action.

      (3) The Administrator may, where necessary to overcome the effects of discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a recipient to take remedial action (i) with respect to handicapped persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's program or activity but who were participants in the program when such discrimination occurred or (ii) with respect to handicapped persons presently in the program or activity but not receiving full benefits or equal and integrated treatment within the program or (iii) with respect to handicapped persons who would have been participants in the program or activity had the discrimination not occurred.

      (b)  A recipient may take steps, in addition to any action that is required by this part, to overcome the effect of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.

      (c)  (1) A recipient shall, within one year of the effective date of this part:

      (i) Evaluate with the assistance of interested persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not or may not meet the requirements of this part;

      (ii) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, any policies and practices that do not meet the requirement of this part; and

      (iii) Take, after consultation with interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and practices.

      (2) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall, for at least three years following completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain on file, make available for public inspection, and provide to the Administrator upon request: (i) A list of the interested persons consulted, (ii) a description of areas examined and any problems identified, and (iii) a description of any modifications made and of any remedial steps taken.

      § 217.7   Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance procedures.

#### § § 217.7

      (a)  A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall designate at least one person to coordinate its efforts to comply with this part.

      (b)  A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall adopt grievance procedures that incorporate appropriate due process standards and that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by this part. Such procedures need not be established with respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to postsecondary educational institutions.

      § 217.8   Notice.

#### § § 217.8

      (a) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall take appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, beneficiaries, applicants, and employees, including those with impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504, and this part. The notification shall state, where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs or activities. The notification shall also include an identification of the responsible employee designated pursuant to § 217.7(a). A recipient shall make the initial notification required by this paragraph within 90 days of the effective date of this part. Methods of initial and continuing notification may include the posting of notices, publication in newspapers and magazines, placement of notices in recipients' publication, and distribution of memoranda or other written communications.

      (b) If a recipient publishes or uses recruitment materials or publications containing general information that it makes available to participants, beneficiaries, applicants, or employees, it shall include in those materials or publications a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section. A recipient may meet the requirement of this paragraph either by including appropriate inserts in existing materials and publications or by revising and reprinting the materials and publications.

      § 217.9   Administrative requirements for small recipients.

#### § § 217.9

      The Administrator may require any recipient with fewer than fifteen employees, or any class of such recipients, to comply with §§ 217.7 and 217.8 in whole or in part, when the Administrator finds a violation of this part or finds that such compliance will not significantly impair the ability of the recipient or class of recipients to provide benefits or services.

      § 217.10   Effect of state or local law or other requirements and effect of employment opportunities.

#### § § 217.10

      (a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any state or local law or other requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.

      (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for handicapped persons than for nonhandicapped persons.

    Subpart B—Employment Practices

      § 217.11   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 217.11

      (2) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under any program or activity to which this part applies in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of handicap.

      (3) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. The relationships referred to in this subparagraph include relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and with organizations providing training and apprenticeships.

      (b)  The provisions of this subpart apply to:

      (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for employment;

      (9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.

      (c) A recipient's obligation to comply with this subpart is not affected by any inconsistent term of any collective bargaining agreement to which it is a party.

      § 217.12   Reasonable accommodation.

#### § § 217.12

      (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program or activity.

      (b) Reasonable accommodation may include: (1) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, and (2) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.

      (c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's program or activity, factors to be considered include:

      (1) The overall size of the recipient's program or activity with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget;

      (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipients workforce; and

      (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.

      (d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial is the need to made reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee or applicant.

      § 217.13   Employment criteria.

#### § § 217.13

      (a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless: (1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question, and (2) alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Administrator to be available.

      (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

      § 217.14   Preemployment inquiries.

#### § § 217.14

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.

      (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 217.6(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 217.6(b) or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped.  That:

      (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

      (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty,  That: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.

      (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentially as medical records, except that:

      (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary accommodations;

      (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and

      § 217.21   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 217.21

      § 217.22   Existing facilities.

#### § § 217.22

      (a)  A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

      (b)  A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, alteration of existing facilities, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 217.23, or any other methods that may result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph(s) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

      (c)  A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

      (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall at a minimum:

      (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;

      (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

      (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under § 217.22(a) and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

      (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.

      (e)  The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

#### § § 217.23

      (a)  Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this part.

Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.

      (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.

      (3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

#### § § 217.42

      (a)  Qualified handicapped persons may not, on the basis of handicap, be denied admission or be subjected to discrimination in admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.

      (b)  In administering its admission policies, a recipient to which this subpart applies:

      (1) May not apply limitation upon the number or proportion of handicapped persons who may be admitted;

      (2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the recipient has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Administrator to be available;

      (3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as to best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and

      (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.

      (c)  When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 217.6(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 217.6(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped,  That:

      (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and

      (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

      (d)  For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.

      § 217.43   Treatment of students; general.

#### § § 217.43

      (a) No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic, research, occupational training, housing, health, insurance, counseling, financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, transportation, other extracurricular, or other postsecondary education aid, benefits, or services to which this subpart applies.

      (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers participation by students in education programs or activities not operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified handicapped persons.

      (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.

#### § § 217.44

      (a)  A recipient to which this subpart applies shall make such modifications to its academic requirements as are necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted.

      (b)  A recipient to which this subpart applies may not impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the recipient's education program or activity.

      (c)  In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

      (d)  (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

      (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.

      § 217.45   Housing.

#### § § 217.45

      (a)  A recipient that provides housing to its nonhandicapped students shall provide comparable, convenient, and accessible housing to handicapped students at the same cost as to others. At the end of the transition period provided for in subpart C, such housing shall be available in sufficient quantity and variety so that the scope of handicapped students' choice of living accommodations is, as a whole, comparable to that of nonhandicapped students.

      (b)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making housing available to any of its students shall take such action as may be necessary to assure itself that such housing is, as a whole, made available in a manner that does not result in discrimination on the basis of handicap.

      § 217.46   Financial and employment assistance to students.

#### § § 217.46

      (a)  (1) In providing financial assistance to qualified handicapped persons, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not (i), on the basis of handicap, provide less assistance than is provided to nonhandicapped persons, limit eligibility for assistance, or otherwise discriminate or (ii) assist any entity or person that provides assistance to any of the recipient's students in a manner that discriminates against qualified handicapped persons on the basis of handicap.

      (2) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established under wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments that require awards to be made on the basis of factors that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap only if the overall effect of the award of scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.

      (b)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in providing employment opportunities to any of its students shall assure itself that such employment opportunities, as a whole, are made available in a manner that would not violate subpart B if they were provided by the recipient.

      (c)  A recipient that employs any of its students may not do so in a manner that violates subpart B.

      § 217.47   Nonacademic services.

#### § § 217.47

      (a)  (1) In providing physical education courses and athletics and similar aid, benefits, or services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation in these activities.

      (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different only if separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of § 217.43(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.

      (b)  A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interest and abilities. This requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual information about licensing and certification requirements that may present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular careers.

      (c)  A recipient that provides significant assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall assure itself that the membership practices of such organizations do not permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

      (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement efforts of the agency, including compliance reviews and other individual complaints which may involve the recipient.

      (5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

      (b)  If the agency cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, the agency will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance.

      (a) An agency may enforce the Act and these regulations through:

      (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the agency under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act and these regulations. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the agency.

      (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:

      (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations by the Act and these regulations.

      (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, state, or local government agency which will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.

      (b) The agency will limit any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the particular recipient and particular program or activity the agency finds in violation of these regulations. The agency will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from the agency.

      (c) The agency will take no action under paragraph (a) of this section until:

      (1) The agency head has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

      (2) Thirty days have lapsed after the agency head has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved.

#### § § 219.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or

In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 219.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section.

In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) An expeditious resolution of allegations that may be damaging to his or her reputation.

    § 223.7   Rights of parties at hearing.

    § 223.9   Appeal.

#### § § 223.9

    Within twenty days of the date of initial decision, either party may appeal the decision to the Administrator. The opposing party shall have ten days after receipt of a copy of the appeal to reply.

    § 223.10   Final decision.

#### § § 223.10

    (a) In cases where the former employee failed to request a hearing after receiving adequate notice, the General Counsel shall decide the matter on its merits based upon the evidence gathered to date, including any written reply of the former employee.

    (b) In cases of appeal under § 223.9, the Administrator shall accept, reject or modify the initial decision based solely on the record of the proceedings or those portions cited by the parties to limit the issues.

    § 223.11   Appropriate action.

#### § § 223.11

    The Administrator may take appropriate action in the case of any individual who is found in violation of the statutory or regulatory post employment restrictions after a final decision by:

    (a) Prohibiting the individual from making, on behalf of any other person (except the United States), any formal or informal appearance before, or with the intent to influence, any oral or written communication to, the Agency on any matter of business for a period not to exceed five years, which may be accomplished by directing Agency employees to refuse to participate in such appearance or to accept any such communication; and

#### § § 224.31

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the A.I.D. Administrator, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.

    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the A.I.D. Administrator in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (, the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:

    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;

    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;

    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;

    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;

    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;

    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;

    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;

    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;

    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;

    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;

    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;

    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;

    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and

    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.

    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the A.I.D. Administrator from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.

    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 224.22(a).

    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—

    (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.

    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

    (b)(1) A notice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days after the ALJ issues an initial decision. However, if another party files a motion for reconsideration under § 224.38, consideration of the appeal shall be stayed automatically pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration.

### Part 225

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 42 U.S.C. 300v-1(b), unless otherwise noted.

**Source:** Source: 82 FR 7270, Jan. 19, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

    § 225.101   To what does this policy apply?

#### § § 225.101

    (a) Except as detailed in § 225.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.

    (b) [Reserved]

    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.

    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.

    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.

    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.

    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the  or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.

    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.  Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the  or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.

    (j) Federal guidance on the requirements of this policy shall be issued only after consultation, for the purpose of harmonization (to the extent appropriate), with other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, unless such consultation is not feasible.

    (k) [Reserved]

    (l) Compliance dates and transition provisions:

    § 225.103   Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.

#### § § 225.103

    (a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 225.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 225.103(d)).

    (b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.

    (c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.

    (d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 225.101(i) or exempted under § 225.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.

    (e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 225.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (e.g., in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).

    § 225.104   Exempt research.

#### § § 225.104

    (a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.

    (b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:

    (1)  Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.

    (2)  The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.

    (3)  The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:

    (1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.

    (2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 225.111(a)(7).

    (3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;

    (B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or

    (C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 225.111(a)(7).

    (ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.

    (iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.

    (4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:

    (i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;

    (ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;

    (iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or

    (iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501

    (5) Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of department or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or service programs, including procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs, possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures, or possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.

    (i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies:

    (i) If wholesome foods without additives are consumed, or

    (ii) If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (7) Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for potential secondary research use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by § 225.111(a)(8).

    (8) Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following criteria are met:

    (i) Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens was obtained in accordance with § 225.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent was obtained in accordance with § 225.117;

    (iii) An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination required by § 225.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and (iv) The investigator does not include returning individual research results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual research results.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.

    (b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.

    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.

    (d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.

    (e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.

    § 225.108   IRB functions and operations.

#### § § 225.108

    (a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:

    (1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;

    (2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant;

    (3) Establish and follow written procedures for:

    (i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution;

    (ii) Determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and

    (iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the research activity in accordance with the terms of the IRB approval until any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.

    (4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency of

    (i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB; and

    (ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.

    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described in § 225.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.

    § 225.109   IRB review of research.

#### § § 225.109

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities under § 225.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption (under § 225.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7), and (8)).

    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of informed consent is in accordance with § 225.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in § 225.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.

    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with § 225.117.

    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.

    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research requiring review by the convened IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, not less than once per year, except as described in § 225.109(f).

    (f)(1) Unless an IRB determines otherwise, continuing review of research is not required in the following circumstances:

    (i) Research eligible for expedited review in accordance with § 225.110;

    (ii) Research reviewed by the IRB in accordance with the limited IRB review described in § 225.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8);

    (iii) Research that has progressed to the point that it involves only one or both of the following, which are part of the IRB-approved study:

    (A) Data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, or

    (B) Accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care.

    (2) [Reserved]

    (g) An IRB shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.

    § 225.110   Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

#### § § 225.110

    (a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the  a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the  for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.

    (b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:

    (i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;

    (ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or

    (iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 225.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).

    (2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 225.108(b).

    (c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.

    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.

    § 225.111   Criteria for IRB approval of research.

#### § § 225.111

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:

    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized:

    (i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and

    (ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.

    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.

    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 225.116.

    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 225.117.

    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.

    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 225.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:

    (i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 225.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);

    (ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 225.117; and

    (iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.

    § 225.112   Review by Institution

#### § § 225.112

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.

    § 225.113   Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.

#### § § 225.113

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

    § 225.114   Cooperative Research.

#### § § 225.114

    (a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.

    (b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.

    (2) The following research is not subject to this provision:

    (i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or

    (ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.

    (c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.

    § 225.115   IRB Records.

#### § § 225.115

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the following:

    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent forms, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.

    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings, which shall be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.

    (3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would not require continuing review as described in § 225.109(f)(1).

    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the investigators.

    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described in § 225.108(a)(2).

    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in § 225.108(a)(3) and (4).

    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as required by § 225.116(c)(5).

    (8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under § 225.110(b)(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review list described in § 225.110(a) is more than minimal risk.

    (9) Documentation specifying the responsibilities that an institution and an organization operating an IRB each will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, as described in § 225.103(e).

    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The institution or IRB may maintain the records in printed form, or electronically. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the Federal department or agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

    § 225.116   General Requirements for Informed Consent.

#### § § 225.116

    (a)  General requirements for informed consent, whether written or oral, are set forth in this paragraph and apply to consent obtained in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Broad consent may be obtained in lieu of informed consent obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section only with respect to the storage, maintenance, and secondary research uses of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens. Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local officials is described in paragraph (e) of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy:

    (1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.

    (3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the legally authorized representative.

    (4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.

    (5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:

    (i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.

    (ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.

    (6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.

    (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:

    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures that are experimental;

    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject;

    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research;

    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;

    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;

    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained;

    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject;

    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled; and

    (9) One of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens:

    (i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecimens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or

    (ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecimens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.

    (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, one or more of the following elements of information, when appropriate, shall also be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:

    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) that are currently unforeseeable;

    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's or the legally authorized representative's consent;

    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research;

    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject;

    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject;

    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study;

    (7) A statement that the subject's biospecimens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit;

    (8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and

    (9) For research involving biospecimens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing ( sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).

    (d)  Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens (collected for either research studies other than the proposed research or nonresearch purposes) is permitted as an alternative to the informed consent requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If the subject or the legally authorized representative is asked to provide broad consent, the following shall be provided to each subject or the subject's legally authorized representative:

    (1) The information required in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), and (b)(8) and, when appropriate, (c)(7) and (9) of this section;

    (2) A general description of the types of research that may be conducted with the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens. This description must include sufficient information such that a reasonable person would expect that the broad consent would permit the types of research conducted;

    (3) A description of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens that might be used in research, whether sharing of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens might occur, and the types of institutions or researchers that might conduct research with the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens;

    (4) A description of the period of time that the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens may be stored and maintained (which period of time could be indefinite), and a description of the period of time that the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens may be used for research purposes (which period of time could be indefinite);

    (5) Unless the subject or legally authorized representative will be provided details about specific research studies, a statement that they will not be informed of the details of any specific research studies that might be conducted using the subject's identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, including the purposes of the research, and that they might have chosen not to consent to some of those specific research studies;

    (6) Unless it is known that clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to the subject in all circumstances, a statement that such results may not be disclosed to the subject; and

    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about the subject's rights and about storage and use of the subject's identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related harm.

    (e) —(1)  An IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed consent for research under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If an individual was asked to provide broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens in accordance with the requirements at paragraph (d) of this section, and refused to consent, an IRB cannot waive consent for the storage, maintenance, or secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.

    (2)  An IRB may approve a consent procedure that omits some, or alters some or all, of the elements of informed consent set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. An IRB may not omit or alter any of the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section. If a broad consent procedure is used, an IRB may not omit or alter any of the elements required under paragraph (d) of this section.

    (3)  In order for an IRB to waive or alter consent as described in this subsection, the IRB must find and document that:

    (i) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:

    (A) Public benefit or service programs;

    (B) Procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs;

    (C) Possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or

    (D) Possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs; and

    (ii) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.

    (f) —(1)  An IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed consent for research under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If an individual was asked to provide broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens in accordance with the requirements at paragraph (d) of this section, and refused to consent, an IRB cannot waive consent for the storage, maintenance, or secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.

    (2)  An IRB may approve a consent procedure that omits some, or alters some or all, of the elements of informed consent set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. An IRB may not omit or alter any of the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section. If a broad consent procedure is used, an IRB may not omit or alter any of the elements required under paragraph (d) of this section.

    (3)  In order for an IRB to waive or alter consent as described in this subsection, the IRB must find and document that:

    (i) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;

    (ii) The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration;

    (iii) If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format;

    (iv) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and

    (v) Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.

    (g)  An IRB may approve a research proposal in which an investigator will obtain information or biospecimens for the purpose of screening, recruiting, or determining the eligibility of prospective subjects without the informed consent of the prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, if either of the following conditions are met:

    (1) The investigator will obtain information through oral or written communication with the prospective subject or legally authorized representative, or

    (2) The investigator will obtain identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens by accessing records or stored identifiable biospecimens.

    (h)  (1) For each clinical trial conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, one IRB-approved informed consent form used to enroll subjects must be posted by the awardee or the Federal department or agency component conducting the trial on a publicly available Federal Web site that will be established as a repository for such informed consent forms.

    (2) If the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the clinical trial determines that certain information should not be made publicly available on a Federal Web site (e.g. confidential commercial information), such Federal department or agency may permit or require redactions to the information posted.

    (3) The informed consent form must be posted on the Federal Web site after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject, as required by the protocol.

    (i)  The informed consent requirements in this policy are not intended to preempt any applicable Federal, state, or local laws (including tribal laws passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed consent to be legally effective.

    (j)  Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, state, or local law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe).

    § 225.117   Documentation of informed consent.

#### § § 225.117

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:

    (1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 225.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.

    (2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 225.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 225.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.

    (c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:

    (i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;

    (ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or

    (iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

    (2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.

    § 225.118   Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

#### § § 225.118

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 225.101(i) or exempted under § 225.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.

    Except for research waived under § 225.101(i) or exempted under § 225.104, in the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.

    § 225.120   Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.

#### § § 225.120

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.

    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one.

    § 225.121   [Reserved]

#### § § 225.121

    § 225.122   Use of Federal funds.

#### § § 225.123

    (a) The department or agency head may require that Federal department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with the terms of this policy.

    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to federal regulation).

    § 225.124   Conditions.

#### § § 225.124

    With respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.

    Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

      § 227.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 227.200

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 227.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

      (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

      (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 227.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 227.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 227.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 227.210   Reporting.

#### § § 227.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 227.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 227.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 227.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 227.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 227.400   Penalties.

#### § § 227.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 227.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 227.405

      Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart F—Agency Reports

      § 227.600   Semi-annual compilation.

Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees.

For services, available for purchase means the service is offered from a vendor which has complied with nationality and foreign government-owned organization requirements of this regulation, and is otherwise organized in a country in the authorized principal geographic code designated in an implementing instrument. This definition does not apply to procurements under the geographic Code 935, see §  228.03, because that geographic code is for any country or area except for prohibited source countries.

      This part is applicable to commodities and services procured under implementing instruments using Federal program funds made available for assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2151  (FAA). The authorities and conditions applicable to the procurement of commodities or services shall be those in effect on the effective date of an implementing instrument for procurement of commodities or services. They include any directives, prohibitions, restrictions or other statutory and related requirements by the United States Congress that govern the Federal program funds appropriated to fund the specific procurement, including those on types of assistance and recipients of assistance. If additional authorities and conditions are otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or related administrative authorities, those authorities and conditions shall be incorporated in the implementing instrument and shall prevail in the event of any conflict with this part 228. This part is not applicable to

      (a) Procurements of commodities and services under General Services Administration (GSA) supply schedules;

      (b) Procurements with donated funds received under USAID's gift authority, FAA section 635(d);

      (c) Procurements funded by cost share or program income as defined in 22 CFR 226.24;

      (d) USAID Title II food programs, including monetization proceeds thereunder.

#### § § 228.03

      (a) USAID has established principal geographic codes which are used by USAID in implementing instruments. This regulation establishes a presumptive authorized principal geographic code, Code 937, for procurement of commodities and services unless otherwise specified in the implementing instrument. Code 937 is defined as the United States, the cooperating/recipient country, and developing countries other than advanced developing countries, and excluding prohibited sources. USAID maintains a list of developing countries, advanced developing countries, and prohibited sources, which will be available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310.

      (b) For purposes of procurements under the authority of the Development Fund for Africa, 22 U.S.C. 2293  for any waivers authorized under Subpart D of this regulation; and if otherwise designated in an implementing instrument, the authorized principal geographic code shall be Code 935, any area or country but excluding prohibited sources.

      (c) For purposes of procurements under the Support for Economic and Democratic Development of the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union, 22 U.S.C. 2295b, the authorized principal geographic codes are Code 937 and Code 110 (New Independent States).

#### § § 228.10

      Sections 228.11 through 228.19 set forth the rules governing the eligible source of commodities and nationality of commodity and service suppliers for USAID Federal share financing under prime and subawards. These rules may be waived in accordance with the provisions in subpart D of this part.

      § 228.11   Source of commodities.

#### § § 228.11

      The source of all commodities financed with Federal program funds appropriated under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, shall be Code 937 (unless Code 935 or 110 are designated in the implementing instrument). Procurements of agricultural commodities, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals must also comply with the special procurement rules in §  228.19. Recipients and contractors are prohibited from engaging suppliers of commodities in an authorized country to import commodities from a country outside of the authorized principal geographic codes for the purposes of circumventing the requirements of this section. Any violation of the prohibition in the preceding sentence will result in the disallowance by USAID of the cost of the procurement of the subject commodity.

However, such a determination is contingent on first ascertaining that no United States construction company with the required capability is currently operating in the cooperating/recipient country or, if there is such a company, that it is not interested in bidding for the proposed contract.

      (b) A foreign-owned local firm is an integral part of the local economy provided:

      (1) It has done business in the cooperating/recipient country on a continuing basis for at least three years prior to the issuance date of invitations for bids or requests for proposals to be financed by USAID;

      (2) It has a demonstrated capability to undertake the proposed activity;

      § 228.18   Long-term leases.

#### § § 228.18

      Any commodity obtained under a long-term lease agreement as defined in § 228.01, including motor vehicles, is subject to the source and nationality requirements of this subpart B of this part, including the special procurement rules as set forth in § 228.19.

      § 228.19   Special source rules requiring United States manufacture or procurement.

#### § § 228.19

      (a) Certain agricultural commodities and products thereof must be procured in the United States if the domestic price is less than parity, unless the commodity cannot reasonably be procured in the United States in fulfillment of the objectives of a particular assistance program under which such commodity procurement is to be financed.

Without such express authorization, the pharmaceutical must be purchased from the U.S. patent holder. In addition, USAID shall not finance non-contraceptive pharmaceuticals without prior written approval as provided in USAID's Automated Directives System Chapter 312. Contraceptives may be financed in accordance with the procedures in ADS 312.

    Subpart C—Conditions Governing the Eligibility of Commodity-Related Services for USAID Financing

      § 228.20   Purpose.

#### § § 228.20

      Sections 228.21 through 228.24 of this part set forth the rules governing the eligibility of commodity-related services, both delivery services and incidental services, for USAID financing. These rules, except for §§ 228.21 and 228.22, may be waived in accordance with the provisions in subpart D of this part. The rules on delivery services apply whether or not USAID is also financing the commodities being transported. In order to be identified and eligible as incidental services, such services must be connected with a USAID-financed commodity procurement.

      § 228.21   Ocean transportation.

#### § § 228.21

Subpart D of 22 CFR part 228 does not apply to this provision.

      § 228.22   Air transportation.

#### § § 228.23

      No source or nationality rules apply to other delivery services, such as export packing, loading, commodity inspection services, and services of a freight forwarder. Such services are eligible when provided as part of a commodity procurement financed by USAID.

      § 228.24   Incidental services.

#### § § 228.24

      Source and nationality rules do not apply to suppliers of incidental services specified in a purchase contract relating to equipment.

    Subpart D—Waivers

      § 228.30   General.

#### § § 228.30

      USAID may waive the rules contained in subparts A, B, and C of this part (except for prohibited sources as defined in §  228.01, and §§  228.21 and 228.22), in order to accomplish project or program objectives. For any waivers authorized, the principal geographic code shall be Code 935, any area or country but excluding prohibited sources. All waivers must be in writing, and where applicable, are limited to the term established by the waiver. All waiver decisions will be made solely on the basis of the following criteria:

      (a) Waivers to permit procurement outside of Code 937 or 110 must be based on a case by case determination that:

      (1) The provision of assistance requires commodities or services of the type that are not produced in and available for purchase in Code 937 or 110;

      (2) It is important to permit procurement from a country not specified in Code 937 or 110 to meet unforeseen circumstances; or

      (3) To promote efficiency in the use of United States foreign assistance resources, including to avoid impairment of foreign assistance objectives.

      (b) Case by case waivers under paragraph (a) of this section may be made on the basis of a commodity or service type or category, rather than processing repeat, individual waivers for an identical or substantially similar commodity or service. Such waivers may be approved on a regional, country, or program basis. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, “produced in and available for purchase in” shall have the same meaning as the definition of “available for purchase” in §  228.01. A waiver under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also be based on the fact that a commodity is not available for purchase in Code 937 or 110 in sufficient, reasonable, and available quantities or sufficient and reasonable quality that is fit for the intended purpose.

      (c) A waiver to authorize procurement from outside the United States of agricultural commodities, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals must meet the requirements of §  228.19.

      (d) Any individual transaction not exceeding $25,000 (excluding those covered by special procurement rules in §  228.19, and excluding procurements from prohibited sources) does not require a waiver and is hereby authorized.

      § 228.31   Authority to approve waivers.

#### § § 228.31

      The authority to approve waivers of established policies under this regulation is delegated within USAID. Recipients or contractors shall request any necessary waivers through the USAID agreement or contracting officer.

      (a)  Either at the application stage or the award stage, Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial assistance or awards of Federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each education program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 229.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.

      (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

      (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

      (c)  (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).

      (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.

      § 229.120   Transfers of property.

#### § § 229.120

      If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 229.205 through 229.235(a).

      § 229.125   Effect of other requirements.

#### § § 229.125

      (a)  The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e ); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.

      (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

      (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

      § 229.130   Effect of employment opportunities.

#### § § 229.130

      The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

      § 229.135   Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance procedures.

#### § § 229.135

      (a)  (1) Each recipient shall implement specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational programs or activities that it operates, and that it is required by Title IX and these Title IX regulations not to discriminate in such a manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 229.300 through 229.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 229.135, or to the designated agency official.

      (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

      (i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such recipient; and

      (ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every student and employee of such recipient.

      (b)  (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form that it makes available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment of students or employees.

      (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by these Title IX regulations.

      (c)  Each recipient shall distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall apprise each of its admission and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall require such representatives to adhere to such policy.

      (c)  In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 229.300 through 229.310 apply:

      (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;

      (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (4) Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such effect.

      (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.

      (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.

      (b)  A recipient that uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

      (c)  Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in providing financial assistance to any of its students, a recipient shall not:

      (1) On the basis of sex, provide different amounts or types of such assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance that is of any particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise discriminate;

      (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex; or

      (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.

      (b)  (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein;  that the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.

      (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:

      (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

      (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and

      (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.

      (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

      (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

      (4) Subject to § 229.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

      (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

      § 229.450   Athletics.

#### § § 229.450

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

      (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

      (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

      (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

      (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

      (x) Publicity.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

      (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

    (c) The United States Agency for International Development may provide a payment to a covered dependent if the qualifying injury to the brain was assessed and diagnosed in person by a currently board-certified physician from the ABPN, AOBNP, ABPMR, or AOBPMR; occurred on or after January 1, 2016; and while the employee was a covered employee of USAID at the time of the dependent's injury.

    (d) Payment for a qualifying injury to the brain will be a non-taxable, one-time lump sum payment.

    (e) USAID will determine the amount paid to each eligible person based on the following factors:

    (1) The responses on the AID 442-1, “Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments;” and

    (2) Whether the Department of Labor (Workers' Compensation) has determined that the requester has no reemployment potential, or the Social Security Administration has approved the requester for Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) benefits;, or the requester's ABPN, AOBNP, ABPMR, or AOBPMR board-certified physician has certified that the individual requires a full-time caregiver for activities of daily living, as defined by the Katz Index of Independence of Daily Living.

    (3) The award thresholds are based on Level III of the Senior Executive Schedule: Base will be 75 percent of Level III pay, and Base+ will be 100 percent of Level III pay. If the requestor meets any of the criteria listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the requestor will be eligible to receive a Base+ payment. Requestors whose neurologists confirm that the definition of “qualifying injury to the brain” has been met but have not met any of the criteria listed paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will be eligible to receive a Base payment. If a requestor who received a Base payment later meets any of the criteria listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the requestor may apply for an additional payment that will be the difference between the Base and Base+ payment.

    (f) The Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) may approve payments under the rule. The Office of Human Capital and Talent Management (HCTM) will notify individuals of the decision in writing.

    (g) An appeal of a decision made by the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) may be directed to the Deputy Administrator for Management and Resources in writing.
