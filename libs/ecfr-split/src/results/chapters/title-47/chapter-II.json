The following parts of this chapter address specific responsibilities with respect to management of telecommunications resources and related procedures which bear upon provision, restoration and continuity of telecommunications services during crises and emergencies. In doing so, the chapter encompasses both national security and emergency preparedness activities, consistent with Executive Order 12472. This concept of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services (as defined in § 201.2(g)) includes crises that do not necessarily entail serious degradation of, or serious threats to, national security. It therefore is a broader concept than the term “national security emergency preparedness activities” in Executive Order 12656, which concerns only national security emergencies, and preparedness activities necessarily related to such emergencies.\n\n\n"

              "(1) Federally owned, leased, and/or operated telecommunications facilities, systems, and networks will be managed during such an emergency by the agency normally controlling the facility, system, or network except that all operations will be subject to the management direction and authority of the officials delegated overall management responsibility for Federal Government systems.\n",
              "(2) Facilities other than those of the Federal Government, with the exception of radio stations in the Aviation Services and certain classes of radio stations in the Maritime Services, will be managed by the authorized common carrier or other person owning and operating such facilities subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidance and direction or in accordance with State or local plans if not subject to FCC jurisdiction.\n",

              "(e) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is the single point of authority within the Federal Government for the wartime emergency functions under section 706 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 606) with respect to the allocation and use of surviving resources in support of national objectives enunciated by the President. Authority may be redelegated as necessary and when it can be exercised within boundaries established by Presidential authority.\n",
              "(f) Radio frequency utilization during a wartime emergency will be in accordance with authorizations, assignments, and mobilization plans in existence at the onset of the emergency. Subject to the overriding control of the Director, OSTP, under the President's War Emergency Powers, spectrum management regarding the authorization and assignment of radio frequencies will be made by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTLA) for the Federal Government, and the Director, OSTP, through the FCC, for all other entities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Radio stations are subject to closure if considered a threat to national security.\n",
              "(g) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, confers authority to the President in the matter of suspension of all rules and regulations pertaining to the use and operation of telecommunications facilities, public or private during wartime emergencies.\n\n\n"

This can best be accomplished by centralized policy development, planning, and broad direction. Detailed operations management will remain decentralized in order to retain flexibility in the use of individual systems in responding to the needs of national security, survival and recovery.

Since surviving areas and population centers would serve as the sources of support to crippled areas of the Nation, the resumption of services between and among surviving metropolitan areas will be a high priority with the carriers.\n\n\n"

Telecommunication services in the Essential NSEP category are those required to be provisioned by due dates specified by service users, or restored promptly, normally without regard to associated overtime or expediting costs. They may be assigned priority levels of “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” or “5” for both provisioning and restoration, depending upon the nature and urgency of the supported function, the impact of a lack of service or service interruption upon the supported function, and, for priority access to public switched services, the user's level of responsibility. Priority level assignments will be valid for no more than three years unless revalidated. To be categorized as Essential NSEP, a telecommunications service must qualify under one of the four subcategories described below: National Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order; or Public Welfare and Maintenance of the National Economic Posture. (Note: Under emergency circumstances, Essential NSEP telecommunication services may be recategorized as Emergency NSEP and assigned a priority level “E” for provisioning.)\n",
