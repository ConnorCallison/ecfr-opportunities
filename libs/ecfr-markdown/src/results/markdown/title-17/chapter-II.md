      § 242.103   Nasdaq passive market making.

#### § § 242.103

      (a)  This section permits broker-dealers to engage in market making transactions in covered securities that are Nasdaq securities without violating the provisions of § 242.101;  this section shall not apply to any security for which a stabilizing bid subject to § 242.104 is in effect, or during any at-the-market offering or best efforts offering.

      (b) —(1)  A passive market maker must effect all transactions in the capacity of a registered market maker on Nasdaq. A passive market maker shall not bid for or purchase a covered security at a price that exceeds the highest independent bid for the covered security at the time of the transaction, except as permitted by paragraph (b)(3) of this section or required by a rule promulgated by the Commission or the NASD governing the handling of customer orders.

      (2)  On each day of the restricted period, a passive market maker's net purchases shall not exceed the greater of its 30% ADTV limitation or 200 shares (together, “purchase limitation”);  That a passive market maker may purchase all of the securities that are part of a single order that, when executed, results in its purchase limitation being equalled or exceeded. If a passive market maker's net purchases equal or exceed its purchase limitation, it shall withdraw promptly its quotations from Nasdaq. If a passive market maker withdraws its quotations pursuant to this paragraph, it may not effect any bid or purchase in the covered security for the remainder of that day, irrespective of any later sales during that day, unless otherwise permitted by § 242.101.

      (3)  If all independent bids for a covered security are reduced to a price below the passive market maker's bid, the passive market maker must lower its bid promptly to a level not higher than the then highest independent bid;  That a passive market maker may continue to bid and effect purchases at its bid at a price exceeding the then highest independent bid until the passive market maker purchases an aggregate amount of the covered security that equals or, through the purchase of all securities that are part of a single order, exceeds the lesser of two times the minimum quotation size for the security, as determined by NASD rules, or the passive market maker's remaining purchasing capacity under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (4)  At all times, the passive market maker's displayed bid size may not exceed the lesser of the minimum quotation size for the covered security, or the passive market maker's remaining purchasing capacity under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;  That a passive market maker whose purchasing capacity at any time is between one and 99 shares may display a bid size of 100 shares.

      (5)  The bid displayed by a passive market maker shall be designated as such.

      (6)  A passive market maker shall notify the NASD in advance of its intention to engage in passive market making, and shall submit to the NASD information regarding passive market making purchases, in such form as the NASD shall prescribe.

      (7)  The prospectus for any registered offering in which any passive market maker intends to effect transactions in any covered security shall contain the information required in §§ 228.502, 228.508, 229.502, and 229.508 of this chapter.

      (c)  No transaction shall be made at a price that the passive market maker knows or has reason to know is the result of activity that is fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive under the securities laws, or any rule or regulation thereunder.

      § 242.104   Stabilizing and other activities in connection with an offering.

#### § § 242.104

      (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to stabilize, to effect any syndicate covering transaction, or to impose a penalty bid, in connection with an offering of any security, in contravention of the provisions of this section. No stabilizing shall be effected at a price that the person stabilizing knows or has reason to know is in contravention of this section, or is the result of activity that is fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive under the securities laws, or any rule or regulation thereunder.

      (b)  Stabilizing is prohibited except for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of a security.

      (c)  To the extent permitted or required by the market where stabilizing occurs, any person stabilizing shall grant priority to any independent bid at the same price irrespective of the size of such independent bid at the time that it is entered.

      (d)  No sole distributor or syndicate or group stabilizing the price of a security or any member or members of such syndicate or group shall maintain more than one stabilizing bid in any one market at the same price at the same time.

      (e)  Stabilizing is prohibited in an at-the-market offering.

      (f) —(1)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph (f), no stabilizing shall be made at a price higher than the lower of the offering price or the stabilizing bid for the security in the principal market (or, if the principal market is closed, the stabilizing bid in the principal market at its previous close).

      (2) —(i)  After the opening of quotations for the security in the principal market, stabilizing may be initiated in any market at a price no higher than the last independent transaction price for the security in the principal market if the security has traded in the principal market on the day stabilizing is initiated or on the most recent prior day of trading in the principal market and the current asked price in the principal market is equal to or greater than the last independent transaction price. If both conditions of the preceding sentence are not satisfied, stabilizing may be initiated in any market after the opening of quotations in the principal market at a price no higher than the highest current independent bid for the security in the principal market.

      (ii)  (A) When the principal market for the security is closed, but immediately before the opening of quotations for the security in the market where stabilizing will be initiated, stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the lower of:

      () The price at which stabilizing could have been initiated in the principal market for the security at its previous close; or

      () The most recent price at which an independent transaction in the security has been effected in any market since the close of the principal market, if the person stabilizing knows or has reason to know of such transaction.

      (B) When the principal market for the security is closed, but after the opening of quotations in the market where stabilizing will be initiated, stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the lower of:

      () The price at which stabilization could have been initiated in the principal market for the security at its previous close; or

      () The last independent transaction price for the security in that market if the security has traded in that market on the day stabilizing is initiated or on the last preceding business day and the current asked price in that market is equal to or greater than the last independent transaction price. If both conditions of the preceding sentence are not satisfied, under this paragraph (f)(__2__)(ii)(B)(), stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the highest current independent bid for the security in that market.

      (iii)  If no  market for the security being distributed exists at the time stabilizing is initiated, no stabilizing shall be initiated at a price in excess of the offering price. If stabilizing is initiated before the offering price is determined, then stabilizing may be continued after determination of the offering price at the price at which stabilizing then could be initiated.

      (3)  A stabilizing bid initiated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, which has not been discontinued, may be maintained, or carried over into another market, irrespective of changes in the independent bids or transaction prices for the security.

      (4)  A stabilizing bid may be increased to a price no higher than the highest current independent bid for the security in the principal market if the principal market is open, or, if the principal market is closed, to a price no higher than the highest independent bid in the principal market at the previous close thereof. A stabilizing bid may be reduced, or carried over into another market at a reduced price, irrespective of changes in the independent bids or transaction prices for the security. If stabilizing is discontinued, it shall not be resumed at a price higher than the price at which stabilizing then could be initiated.

      (5)  If a stabilizing bid is expressed in a currency other than the currency of the principal market for the security, such bid may be initiated, maintained, or adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate, consistent with the provisions of this section. If, in initiating, maintaining, or adjusting a stabilizing bid pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5), the bid would be at or below the midpoint between two trading differentials, such stabilizing bid shall be adjusted downward to the lower differential.

      (6)  If a security goes ex-dividend, ex-rights, or ex-distribution, the stabilizing bid shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the dividend, right, or distribution. If, in reducing a stabilizing bid pursuant to this paragraph (f)(6), the bid would be at or below the midpoint between two trading differentials, such stabilizing bid shall be adjusted downward to the lower differential.

      (7)  When two or more securities are being offered as a unit, the component securities shall not be stabilized at prices the sum of which exceeds the then permissible stabilizing price for the unit.

      (8)  Any stabilizing price that otherwise meets the requirements of this section need not be adjusted to reflect special prices available to any group or class of persons (including employees or holders of warrants or rights).

      (g)  (1) Stabilizing to facilitate an offering of a security in the United States shall not be deemed to be in violation of this section if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      (i) No stabilizing is made in the United States;

      (ii) Stabilizing outside the United States is made in a jurisdiction with statutory or regulatory provisions governing stabilizing that are comparable to the provisions of this section; and

      (iii) No stabilizing is made at a price above the offering price in the United States, except as permitted by paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

      (2) For purposes of this paragraph (g), the Commission by rule, regulation, or order may determine whether a foreign statute or regulation is comparable to this section considering, among other things, whether such foreign statute or regulation: specifies appropriate purposes for which stabilizing is permitted; provides for disclosure and control of stabilizing activities; places limitations on stabilizing levels; requires appropriate recordkeeping; provides other protections comparable to the provisions of this section; and whether procedures exist to enable the Commission to obtain information concerning any foreign stabilizing transactions.

      (h)  (1) Any person displaying or transmitting a bid that such person knows is for the purpose of stabilizing shall provide prior notice to the market on which such stabilizing will be effected, and shall disclose its purpose to the person with whom the bid is entered.

      (2) Any person effecting a syndicate covering transaction or imposing a penalty bid shall provide prior notice to the self-regulatory organization with direct authority over the principal market in the United States for the security for which the syndicate covering transaction is effected or the penalty bid is imposed.

      (3) Any person subject to this section who sells to, or purchases for the account of, any person any security where the price of such security may be or has been stabilized, shall send to the purchaser at or before the completion of the transaction, a prospectus, offering circular, confirmation, or other document containing a statement similar to that comprising the statement provided for in Item 502(d) of Regulation S-B (§ 228.502(d) of this chapter) or Item 502(d) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.502(d) of this chapter).

      (i)  A person subject to this section shall keep the information and make the notification required by § 240.17a-2 of this chapter.

      (j)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to:

      (1)  “Exempted securities,” as defined in section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)); or

      (2)  Transactions in securities eligible for resale under § 230.144A(d)(3) of this chapter, if such securities are sold in the United States solely to:

      (i) Qualified institutional buyers, as defined in § 230.144A(a)(1) of this chapter, or to purchasers that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believes are qualified institutional buyers, in a transaction exempt from registration under section 4(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(2)) or §§ 230.144A or § 230.500  of this chapter; or

      (ii) Persons not deemed to be “U.S. persons” for purposes of §§ 230.902(o)(2) or 230.902(o)(7) of this chapter, during a distribution qualifying under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

    Regulation SHO—Regulation of Short Sales

      § 242.200   Definition of “short sale” and marking requirements.

#### § § 242.200

      (a) The term  shall mean any sale of a security which the seller does not own or any sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller.

      (b) A person shall be deemed to own a security if:

      (1) The person or his agent has title to it; or

      (2) The person has purchased, or has entered into an unconditional contract, binding on both parties thereto, to purchase it, but has not yet received it; or

      (3) The person owns a security convertible into or exchangeable for it and has tendered such security for conversion or exchange; or

      (4) The person has an option to purchase or acquire it and has exercised such option; or

      (5) The person has rights or warrants to subscribe to it and has exercised such rights or warrants; or

      (6) The person holds a security futures contract to purchase it and has received notice that the position will be physically settled and is irrevocably bound to receive the underlying security.

      (c) A person shall be deemed to own securities only to the extent that he has a net long position in such securities.

      (d) A broker or dealer shall be deemed to own a security, even if it is not net long, if:

      (1) The broker or dealer acquired that security while acting in the capacity of a block positioner; and

      (2) If and to the extent that the broker or dealer's short position in the security is the subject of offsetting positions created in the course of bona fide arbitrage, risk arbitrage, or bona fide hedge activities.

      (e) A broker-dealer shall be deemed to own a security even if it is not net long, if:

      (1) The broker-dealer is unwinding index arbitrage position involving a long basket of stock and one or more short index futures traded on a board of trade or one or more standardized options contracts as defined in 17 CFR 240.9b-1(a)(4); and

      (2) If and to the extent that the broker-dealer's short position in the security is the subject of offsetting positions created and maintained in the course of bona-fide arbitrage, risk arbitrage, or bona fide hedge activities; and

      (3) The sale does not occur during a period commencing at the time that the NYSE Composite Index has declined by two percent or more from its closing value on the previous day and terminating upon the end of the trading day. The two percent shall be calculated at the beginning of each calendar quarter and shall be two percent, rounded down to the nearest 10 points, of the average closing value of the NYSE Composite Index for the last month of the previous quarter.

      (f) In order to determine its net position, a broker or dealer shall aggregate all of its positions in a security unless it qualifies for independent trading unit aggregation, in which case each independent trading unit shall aggregate all of its positions in a security to determine its net position. Independent trading unit aggregation is available only if:

      (1) The broker or dealer has a written plan of organization that identifies each aggregation unit, specifies its trading objective(s), and supports its independent identity;

      (2) Each aggregation unit within the firm determines, at the time of each sale, its net position for every security that it trades;

      (3) All traders in an aggregation unit pursue only the particular trading objective(s) or strategy(s) of that aggregation unit and do not coordinate that strategy with any other aggregation unit; and

      (4) Individual traders are assigned to only one aggregation unit at any time.

      (g) A broker or dealer must mark all sell orders of any equity security as “long,” “short,” or “short exempt.”

      (1) An order to sell shall be marked “long” only if the seller is deemed to own the security being sold pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section and either:

      (i) The security to be delivered is in the physical possession or control of the broker or dealer; or

      (ii) It is reasonably expected that the security will be in the physical possession or control of the broker or dealer no later than the settlement of the transaction.

      (2) A sale order shall be marked “short exempt” only if the provisions of § 242.201(c) or (d) are met.

      (h) Upon written application or upon its own motion, the Commission may grant an exemption from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, to any transaction or class of transactions, or to any security or class of securities, or to any person or class of persons.

      (9) The term  shall have the same meaning as in § 242.600(b)(106).

      (b)(1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to:

      (i) Prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day; and

      (ii) Impose the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis pursuant to an effective national market system plan.

      (iii)  that the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to permit:

      (A) The execution of a displayed short sale order of a covered security by a trading center if, at the time of initial display of the short sale order, the order was at a price above the current national best bid; and

      (B) The execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security marked “short exempt” without regard to whether the order is at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid.

      (2) A trading center shall regularly surveil to ascertain the effectiveness of the policies and procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section and shall take prompt action to remedy deficiencies in such policies and procedures.

      (3) The determination regarding whether the price of a covered security has decreased by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day shall be made by the listing market for the covered security and, if such decrease has occurred, the listing market shall immediately make such information available as provided in § 242.603(b).

      (c) Following any determination and notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to a covered security, a broker or dealer submitting a short sale order of the covered security in question to a trading center may mark the order “short exempt” if the broker or dealer identifies the order as being at a price above the current national best bid at the time of submission;

      (1) The broker or dealer that identifies a short sale order of a covered security as “short exempt” in accordance with this paragraph (c) must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent incorrect identification of orders for purposes of this paragraph; and

      (2) The broker or dealer shall regularly surveil to ascertain the effectiveness of the policies and procedures required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and shall take prompt action to remedy deficiencies in such policies and procedures.

      (d) Following any determination and notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to a covered security, a broker or dealer may mark a short sale order of a covered security “short exempt” if the broker or dealer has a reasonable basis to believe that:

      (1) The short sale order of a covered security is by a person that is deemed to own the covered security pursuant to § 242.200, provided that the person intends to deliver the security as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed.

      (2) The short sale order of a covered security is by a market maker to offset customer odd-lot orders or to liquidate an odd-lot position that changes such broker's or dealer's position by no more than a unit of trading.

      (3) The short sale order of a covered security is for a good faith account of a person who then owns another security by virtue of which he is, or presently will be, entitled to acquire an equivalent number of securities of the same class as the securities sold; provided such sale, or the purchase which such sale offsets, is effected for the bona fide purpose of profiting from a current difference between the price of the security sold and the security owned and that such right of acquisition was originally attached to or represented by another security or was issued to all the holders of any such securities of the issuer.

      (4) The short sale order of a covered security is for a good faith account and submitted to profit from a current price difference between a security on a foreign securities market and a security on a securities market subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, provided that the short seller has an offer to buy on a foreign market that allows the seller to immediately cover the short sale at the time it was made. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a depository receipt of a security shall be deemed to be the same security as the security represented by such receipt.

      (5)(i) The short sale order of a covered security is by an underwriter or member of a syndicate or group participating in the distribution of a security in connection with an over-allotment of securities; or

      (ii) The short sale order of a covered security is for purposes of a lay-off sale by an underwriter or member of a syndicate or group in connection with a distribution of securities through a rights or standby underwriting commitment.

      (6) The short sale order of a covered security is by a broker or dealer effecting the execution of a customer purchase or the execution of a customer “long” sale on a riskless principal basis. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(6), a broker or dealer must have written policies and procedures in place to assure that, at a minimum:

      (i) The customer order was received prior to the offsetting transaction;

      (ii) The offsetting transaction is allocated to a riskless principal or customer account within 60 seconds of execution; and

      (iii) The broker or dealer has supervisory systems in place to produce records that enable the broker or dealer to accurately and readily reconstruct, in a time-sequenced manner, all orders on which a broker or dealer relies pursuant to this exception.

      (7) The short sale order is for the sale of a covered security at the volume weighted average price (VWAP) that meets the following criteria:

      (i) The VWAP for the covered security is calculated by:

      (A) Calculating the values for every regular way trade reported in the consolidated system for the security during the regular trading session, by multiplying each such price by the total number of shares traded at that price;

      (B) Compiling an aggregate sum of all values; and

      (C) Dividing the aggregate sum by the total number of reported shares for that day in the security.

      (ii) The transactions are reported using a special VWAP trade modifier.

      (iii) The VWAP matched security:

      (A) Qualifies as an “actively-traded security” pursuant to § 242.101 and § 242.102; or

      (B) The proposed short sale transaction is being conducted as part of a basket transaction of twenty or more securities in which the subject security does not comprise more than 5% of the value of the basket traded.

      (iv) The transaction is not effected for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in or otherwise affecting the price of any security.

      (v) A broker or dealer shall be permitted to act as principal on the contra-side to fill customer short sale orders only if the broker's or dealer's position in the covered security, as committed by the broker or dealer during the pre-opening period of a trading day and aggregated across all of its customers who propose to sell short the same security on a VWAP basis, does not exceed 10% of the covered security's relevant average daily trading volume.

      (e) No self-regulatory organization shall have any rule that is not in conformity with, or conflicts with, this section.

      (f) Upon written application or upon its own motion, the Commission may grant an exemption from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, to any person or class of persons, to any transaction or class of transactions, or to any security or class of securities to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate, in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors.

      § 242.203   Borrowing and delivery requirements.

#### § § 242.203

      (a)  (1) If a broker or dealer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the sale of an equity security was or will be effected pursuant to an order marked “long,” such broker or dealer shall not lend or arrange for the loan of any security for delivery to the purchaser's broker after the sale, or fail to deliver a security on the date delivery is due.

      (i) To the loan of any security by a broker or dealer through the medium of a loan to another broker or dealer;

      (iii) If, prior to any loan or arrangement to loan any security for delivery, or failure to deliver, a national securities exchange, in the case of a sale effected thereon, or a national securities association, in the case of a sale not effected on an exchange, finds:

      (A) That such sale resulted from a mistake made in good faith;

      (B) That due diligence was used to ascertain that the circumstances specified in § 242.200(g) existed; and

      (C) Either that the condition of the market at the time the mistake was discovered was such that undue hardship would result from covering the transaction by a “purchase for cash” or that the mistake was made by the seller's broker and the sale was at a permissible price under any applicable short sale price test.

      (b)  (1) A broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order in an equity security from another person, or effect a short sale in an equity security for its own account, unless the broker or dealer has:

      (ii) Any sale of a security that a person is deemed to own pursuant to § 242.200, provided that the broker or dealer has been reasonably informed that the person intends to deliver such security as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed. If the person has not delivered such security within 35 days after the trade date, the broker-dealer that effected the sale must borrow securities or close out the short position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity;

      (iii) Short sales effected by a market maker in connection with bona-fide market making activities in the security for which this exception is claimed; and

      (iv) Transactions in security futures.

      (iv) If a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for thirteen consecutive settlement days, the participant and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions, including any market maker that would otherwise be entitled to rely on the exception provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, may not accept a short sale order in the threshold security from another person, or effect a short sale in the threshold security for its own account, without borrowing the security or entering into a bona-fide arrangement to borrow the security, until the participant closes out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity;

      (v) If a participant of a registered clearing agency entitled to rely on the 35 consecutive settlement day close-out requirement contained in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in the threshold security for 35 consecutive settlement days, the participant and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions, including any market maker, that would otherwise be entitled to rely on the exception provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, may not accept a short sale order in the threshold security from another person, or effect a short sale in the threshold security for its own account, without borrowing the security or entering into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the security, until the participant closes out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity;

      (vi) If a participant of a registered clearing agency reasonably allocates a portion of a fail to deliver position to another registered broker or dealer for which it clears trades or for which it is responsible for settlement, based on such broker or dealer's short position, then the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) relating to such fail to deliver position shall apply to the portion of such registered broker or dealer that was allocated the fail to deliver position, and not to the participant; and

      (vii) A participant of a registered clearing agency shall not be deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) where the participant enters into an arrangement with another person to purchase securities as required by this paragraph (b)(3), and the participant knows or has reason to know that the other person will not deliver securities in settlement of the purchase.

      (b) If a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position in any equity security at a registered clearing agency and does not close out such fail to deliver position in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the participant and any broker or dealer from which it receives trades for clearance and settlement, including any market maker that would otherwise be entitled to rely on the exception provided in § 242.203(b)(2)(iii), may not accept a short sale order in the equity security from another person, or effect a short sale in the equity security for its own account, to the extent that the broker or dealer submits its short sales to that participant for clearance and settlement, without first borrowing the security, or entering into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the security, until the participant closes out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity and that purchase has cleared and settled at a registered clearing agency;  A broker or dealer shall not be subject to the requirements of this paragraph if the broker or dealer timely certifies to the participant of a registered clearing agency that it has not incurred a fail to deliver position on settlement date for a long or short sale in an equity security for which the participant has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency or that the broker or dealer is in compliance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (c) The participant must notify any broker or dealer from which it receives trades for clearance and settlement, including any market maker that would otherwise be entitled to rely on the exception provided in § 242.203(b)(2)(iii):

      (1) That the participant has a fail to deliver position in an equity security at a registered clearing agency that has not been closed out in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and

      (2) When the purchase that the participant has made to close out the fail to deliver position has cleared and settled at a registered clearing agency.

      (d) If a participant of a registered clearing agency reasonably allocates a portion of a fail to deliver position to another registered broker or dealer for which it clears trades or from which it receives trades for settlement, based on such broker's or dealer's short position, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section relating to such fail to deliver position shall apply to such registered broker or dealer that was allocated the fail to deliver position, and not to the participant. A broker or dealer that has been allocated a portion of a fail to deliver position that does not comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must immediately notify the participant that it has become subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

      (e) Even if a participant of a registered clearing agency has not closed out a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or has not allocated a fail to deliver position to a broker or dealer in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a broker or dealer shall not be subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section if the broker or dealer purchases or borrows the securities, and if:

      (2) The purchase or borrow is executed after trade date but by no later than the end of regular trading hours on settlement date for the transaction;

      (g)  (1) For purposes of this section, the term  shall mean the business day on which delivery of a security and payment of money is to be made through the facilities of a registered clearing agency in connection with the sale of a security.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the term  has the same meaning as in § 242.600(b)(88) (Rule 600(b)(88) of Regulation NMS).

      (1) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a securities account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with Regulation T and the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.

      (2) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a futures account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.

      (b)  (1) The requirements for security futures and related positions in one account may not be met by considering items in any other account, except as permitted or required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or applicable margin rules. If withdrawals of cash, securities or other assets deposited as margin are permitted under this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406), bookkeeping entries shall be made when such cash, securities, or assets are used for purposes of meeting requirements in another account.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the security futures intermediary shall consider all futures accounts in which security futures and related positions are held that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer to be a single account for purposes of this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406). The security futures intermediary may combine such accounts with other futures accounts that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer for purposes of computing a customer's overall margin requirement, as permitted or required by applicable margin rules.

      (c)  If a partner of the security futures intermediary has an account with the security futures intermediary in which security futures or related positions are held, the security futures intermediary shall disregard the partner's financial relations with the firm (as shown in the partner's capital and ordinary drawing accounts) in calculating the margin or equity of any such account.

      (d)  If an account in which security futures or related positions are held is the account of a joint venture in which the security futures intermediary participates, any interest of the security futures intermediary in the joint account in excess of the interest which the security futures intermediary would have on the basis of its right to share in the profits shall be margined in accordance with this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406).

      (e)  (1) No security futures intermediary may extend or maintain credit to or for any customer for the purpose of evading or circumventing any requirement under this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406).

      (2) A security futures intermediary may arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer by any person, provided that the security futures intermediary does not willfully arrange credit that would constitute a violation of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR parts 220, 221, and 224) by such person.

      (f)  Once a person ceases to qualify as an exempted person, it shall notify the security futures intermediary of this fact before entering into any new security futures transaction or related transaction that would require additional margin to be deposited under this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406). Financial relations with respect to any such transactions shall be subject to the provisions of this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406).

      (b) —(1)  The required margin for each long or short position in a security future shall be fifteen (15) percent of the current market value of such security future.

      (2)  Notwithstanding the margin levels specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a self-regulatory authority may set the required initial or maintenance margin level for an offsetting position involving security futures and related positions at a level lower than the level that would be required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if such positions were margined separately, pursuant to rules that meet the criteria set forth in section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78g(c)(2)(B)) and are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)) and, as applicable, Section 5c(c) of the CEA (7 U.S.C. 7a-2(c)).

      (c)  An exchange registered under secti_o_n 6(g) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(g)), or a national securities association registered under section 15A(k) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78-3(k)), may raise or lower the required margin level for a security future to a level not lower than that specified in this section, in accordance with section 19(b)(7) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(7)).

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a security futures intermediary need not value a margin equity security at its Regulation T collateral value when determining whether the required margin for the security futures and related positions in a futures account is satisfied,

      (ii) Additional margin is required to be deposited on any day when the day's security futures transactions and related transactions would create or increase a margin deficiency in the account if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value, and shall be for the amount of the margin deficiency so created or increased (a “special margin requirement”); and

      (iii) Cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for the positions in an account are not permitted to be withdrawn from the account at any time that:

      (B) The withdrawal, together with other transactions, deposits, and withdrawals on the same day, would create or increase a margin deficiency if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value.

      (2) All security futures transactions and related transactions on any day shall be combined to determine the amount of a special margin requirement. Additional margin deposited to satisfy a special margin requirement shall be valued at an amount no greater than its Regulation T collateral value.

      (3) If the alternative collateral valuation method set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is used with respect to an account in which security futures or related positions are carried:

      (i) An account that is transferred from one security futures intermediary to another may be treated as if it had been maintained by the transferee from the date of its origin, if the transferee accepts, in good faith, a signed statement of the transferor (or, if that is not practicable, of the customer), that any margin call issued under this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406) has been satisfied; and

      (ii) An account that is transferred from one customer to another as part of a transaction, not undertaken to avoid the requirements of this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406), may be treated as if it had been maintained for the transferee from the date of its origin, if the security futures intermediary accepts in good faith and keeps with the transferee account a signed statement of the transferor describing the circumstances for the transfer.

      (f)  No guarantee of a customer's account shall be given any effect for purposes of determining whether the required margin in an account is satisfied, except as permitted under applicable margin rules.

      (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the security futures intermediary, in its usual practice, may deduct the following items from an account in which security futures or related positions are held if they are considered in computing the balance of such account:

      (1) Variation settlement payable, directly or indirectly, to a clearing agency that is registered under section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) or a derivatives clearing organization that is registered under section 5b of the CEA (7 U.S.C. 7a-1);

      (2) Interest charged on credit maintained in the account;

      (3) Communication or shipping charges with respect to transactions in the account;

      (4) Payment of commissions, brokerage, taxes, storage and other charges lawfully accruing in connection with the positions and transactions in the account;

      (5) Any service charges that the security futures intermediary may impose; or

      (6) Any other withdrawals that are permitted from a securities margin account under Regulation T, to the extent permitted under applicable margin rules.

#### § § 242.406

      (a)  If any margin call required by this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406) is not met in full, the security futures intermediary shall take the deduction required with respect to an undermargined account in computing its net capital under Commission or CFTC rules.

      (b)  If at any time there is a liquidating deficit in an account in which security futures are held, the security futures intermediary shall take steps to liquidate positions in the account promptly and in an orderly manner.

      (2) Every broker or dealer who is a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association shall promptly transmit to the exchange or association of which it is a member all information required by any effective transaction reporting plan filed by such exchange or association (either individually or jointly with other exchanges and/or associations).

      (c)  Notwithstanding any provision of any effective transaction reporting plan, no national securities exchange or national securities association may, either individually or jointly, by rule, stated policy or practice, transaction reporting plan or otherwise, prohibit, condition or otherwise limit, directly or indirectly, the ability of any vendor to retransmit, for display in moving tickers, transaction reports or last sale data made available pursuant to any effective transaction reporting plan;  that a national securities exchange or national securities association may, by means of an effective transaction reporting plan, condition such retransmission upon appropriate undertakings to ensure that any charges for the distribution of transaction reports or last sale data in moving tickers permitted by paragraph (d) of this section are collected.

      (d)  Nothing in this section shall preclude any national securities exchange or national securities association, separately or jointly, pursuant to the terms of an effective transaction reporting plan, from imposing reasonable, uniform charges (irrespective of geographic location) for distribution of transaction reports or last sale data.

      (e)  The Commission may, in its discretion, entertain appeals in connection with the implementation or operation of any effective transaction reporting plan in accordance with the provisions of § 242.608(d).

      (f)  The Commission may exempt from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any national securities exchange, national securities association, broker, dealer, or specified security if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors and the removal of impediments to, and perfection of the mechanisms of, a national market system.

      § 242.602   Dissemination of quotations in NMS securities.

#### § § 242.602

      (a)  (1) Every national securities exchange and national securities association shall establish and maintain procedures and mechanisms for collecting bids, offers, quotation sizes, and aggregate quotation sizes from responsible brokers or dealers who are members of such exchange or association, processing such bids, offers, and sizes, and making such bids, offers, and sizes available to vendors, as follows:

      (i) Each national securities exchange shall at all times such exchange is open for trading, collect, process, and make available to vendors the best bid, the best offer, and aggregate quotation sizes for each subject security listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges which is communicated on any national securities exchange by any responsible broker or dealer, but shall not include:

      (A) Any bid or offer executed immediately after communication and any bid or offer communicated by a responsible broker or dealer other than an exchange market maker which is cancelled or withdrawn if not executed immediately after communication; and

      (B) Any bid or offer communicated during a period when trading in that security has been suspended or halted, or prior to the commencement of trading in that security on any trading day, on that exchange.

      (ii) Each national securities association shall, at all times that last sale information with respect to NMS securities is reported pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan, collect, process, and make available to vendors the best bid, best offer, and quotation sizes communicated otherwise than on an exchange by each member of such association acting in the capacity of an OTC market maker for each subject security and the identity of that member (excluding any bid or offer executed immediately after communication), except during any period when over-the-counter trading in that security has been suspended.

      (2) Each national securities exchange shall, with respect to each published bid and published offer representing a bid or offer of a member for a subject security, establish and maintain procedures for ascertaining and disclosing to other members of that exchange, upon presentation of orders sought to be executed by them in reliance upon paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the identity of the responsible broker or dealer who made such bid or offer and the quotation size associated with it.

      (3)(i) If, at any time a national securities exchange is open for trading, such exchange determines, pursuant to rules approved by the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)), that the level of trading activities or the existence of unusual market conditions is such that the exchange is incapable of collecting, processing, and making available to vendors the data for a subject security required to be made available pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a manner that accurately reflects the current state of the market on such exchange, such exchange shall immediately notify all specified persons of that determination. Upon such notification, responsible brokers or dealers that are members of that exchange shall be relieved of their obligation under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section and such exchange shall be relieved of its obligations under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for that security; , that such exchange will continue, to the maximum extent practicable under the circumstances, to collect, process, and make available to vendors data for that security in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (ii) During any period a national securities exchange, or any responsible broker or dealer that is a member of that exchange, is relieved of any obligation imposed by this section for any subject security by virtue of a notification made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, such exchange shall monitor the activity or conditions which formed the basis for such notification and shall immediately renotify all specified persons when that exchange is once again capable of collecting, processing, and making available to vendors the data for that security required to be made available pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a manner that accurately reflects the current state of the market on such exchange. Upon such renotification, any exchange or responsible broker or dealer which had been relieved of any obligation imposed by this section as a consequence of the prior notification shall again be subject to such obligation.

      (4) Nothing in this section shall preclude any national securities exchange or national securities association from making available to vendors indications of interest or bids and offers for a subject security at any time such exchange or association is not required to do so pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (5)(i) Any national securities exchange may make an election for purposes of the definition of  in § 242.600(b)(101) for any NMS security, by collecting, processing, and making available bids, offers, quotation sizes, and aggregate quotation sizes in that security; except that for any NMS security previously listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on only one exchange and not traded by any OTC market maker, such election shall be made by notifying all specified persons, and shall be effective at the opening of trading on the business day following notification.

      (ii) Any member of a national securities association acting in the capacity of an OTC market maker may make an election for purposes of the definition of  in § 242.600(b)(101) for any NMS security, by communicating to its association bids, offers, and quotation sizes in that security; except that for any other NMS security listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on only one exchange and not traded by any other OTC market maker, such election shall be made by notifying its association and all specified persons, and shall be effective at the opening of trading on the business day following notification.

      (iii) The election of a national securities exchange or member of a national securities association for any NMS security pursuant to this paragraph (a)(5) shall cease to be in effect if such exchange or member ceases to make available or communicate bids, offers, and quotation sizes in such security.

      (b)  (1) Each responsible broker or dealer shall promptly communicate to its national securities exchange or national securities association, pursuant to the procedures established by that exchange or association, its best bids, best offers, and quotation sizes for any subject security.

      (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute any order to buy or sell a subject security, other than an odd-lot order, presented to it by another broker or dealer, or any other person belonging to a category of persons with whom such responsible broker or dealer customarily deals, at a price at least as favorable to such buyer or seller as the responsible broker's or dealer's published bid or published offer (exclusive of any commission, commission equivalent or differential customarily charged by such responsible broker or dealer in connection with execution of any such order) in any amount up to its published quotation size.

      (3)(i) No responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute a transaction for any subject security as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to purchase or sell that subject security in an amount greater than such revised quotation size if:

      (A) Prior to the presentation of an order for the purchase or sale of a subject security, a responsible broker or dealer has communicated to its exchange or association, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a revised quotation size; or

      (B) At the time an order for the purchase or sale of a subject security is presented, a responsible broker or dealer is in the process of effecting a transaction in such subject security, and immediately after the completion of such transaction, it communicates to its exchange or association a revised quotation size, such responsible broker or dealer shall not be obligated by paragraph (b)(2) of this section to purchase or sell that subject security in an amount greater than such revised quotation size.

      (ii) No responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute a transaction for any subject security as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:

      (A) Before the order sought to be executed is presented, such responsible broker or dealer has communicated to its exchange or association pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a revised bid or offer; or

      (B) At the time the order sought to be executed is presented, such responsible broker or dealer is in the process of effecting a transaction in such subject security, and, immediately after the completion of such transaction, such responsible broker or dealer communicates to its exchange or association pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a revised bid or offer; , that such responsible broker or dealer shall nonetheless be obligated to execute any such order in such subject security as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section at its revised bid or offer in any amount up to its published quotation size or revised quotation size.

      (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section:

      (i) No national securities exchange or OTC market maker may make available, disseminate or otherwise communicate to any vendor, directly or indirectly, for display on a terminal or other display device any bid, offer, quotation size, or aggregate quotation size for any NMS security which is not a subject security with respect to such exchange or OTC market maker; and

      (ii) No vendor may disseminate or display on a terminal or other display device any bid, offer, quotation size, or aggregate quotation size from any national securities exchange or OTC market maker for any NMS security which is not a subject security with respect to such exchange or OTC market maker.

      (5)(i) Entry of any priced order for an NMS security by an exchange market maker or OTC market maker in that security into an electronic communications network that widely disseminates such order shall be deemed to be:

      (A) A bid or offer under this section, to be communicated to the market maker's exchange or association pursuant to this paragraph (b) for at least the minimum quotation size that is required by the rules of the market maker's exchange or association if the priced order is for the account of a market maker, or the actual size of the order up to the minimum quotation size required if the priced order is for the account of a customer; and

      (B) A communication of a bid or offer to a vendor for display on a display device for purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (ii) An exchange market maker or OTC market maker that has entered a priced order for an NMS security into an electronic communications network that widely disseminates such order shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section if the electronic communications network:

      (A)() Provides to a national securities exchange or national securities association (or an exclusive processor acting on behalf of one or more exchanges or associations) the prices and sizes of the orders at the highest buy price and the lowest sell price for such security entered in, and widely disseminated by, the electronic communications network by exchange market makers and OTC market makers for the NMS security, and such prices and sizes are included in the quotation data made available by such exchange, association, or exclusive processor to vendors pursuant to this section; and

      () Provides, to any broker or dealer, the ability to effect a transaction with a priced order widely disseminated by the electronic communications network entered therein by an exchange market maker or OTC market maker that is:

      () Equ_i_valent to the ability of any broker or dealer to effect a transaction with an exchange market maker or OTC market maker pursuant to the rules of the national securities exchange or national securities association to which the electronic communications network supplies such bids and offers; and

      () At the price of the highest priced buy order or lowest priced sell order, or better, for the lesser of the cumulative size of such priced orders entered therein by exchange market makers or OTC market makers at such price, or the size of the execution sought by the broker or dealer, for such security; or

      (B) Is an alternative trading system that:

      () Displays orders and provides the ability to effect transactions with such orders under § 242.30_1_(b)(3); and

      () Otherwise is in compliance with Regulation ATS (§ _2_42.300 through § 242.303).

      (c)  (1) A national securities exchange or national securities association:

      (i) Shall not be required, under paragraph (a) of this section, to collect from responsible brokers or dealers who are members of such exchange or association, or to make available to vendors, the quotation sizes and aggregate quotation sizes for listed options, if such exchange or association establishes by rule and periodically publishes the quotation size for which such responsible brokers or dealers are obligated to execute an order to buy or sell an options series that is a subject security at its published bid or offer under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

      (ii) May establish by rule and periodically publish a quotation size, which shall not be for less than one contract, for which responsible brokers or dealers who are members of such exchange or association are obligated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to execute an order to buy or sell a listed option for the account of a broker or dealer that is in an amount different from the quotation size for which it is obligated to execute an order for the account of a customer; and

      (iii) May establish and maintain procedures and mechanisms for collecting from responsible brokers and dealers who are members of such exchange or association, and making available to vendors, the quotation sizes and aggregate quotation sizes in listed options for which such responsible broker or dealer will be obligated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to execute an order from a customer to buy or sell a listed option and establish by rule and periodically publish the size, which shall not be less than one contract, for which such responsible brokers or dealers are obligated to execute an order for the account of a broker or dealer.

      (2) If, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rules of a national securities exchange or national securities association do not require its members to communicate to it their quotation sizes for listed options, a responsible broker or dealer that is a member of such exchange or association shall:

      (i) Be relieved of its obligations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to communicate to such exchange or association its quotation sizes for any listed option; and

      (ii) Comply with its obligations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section by executing any order to buy or sell a listed option, in an amount up to the size established by such exchange's or association's rules under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (3)  Each responsible broker or dealer, within thirty seconds of receiving an order to buy or sell a listed option in an amount greater than the quotation size established by a national securities exchange's or national securities association's rules pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or its published quotation size must:

      (i) Execute the entire order; or

      (ii)(A) Execute that portion of the order equal to at least:

      () The quotation size established by a national securities exchange's or national securities association's rules, pursuant to paragraph (c)(_1_) of this section, to the extent that such exchange or association does not collect and make available to vendors quotation size and aggregate quotation size under paragraph (a) of this section; or

      () Its published quotation size; and

      (B) Revise its bid or offer.

      (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, no responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute a transaction for any listed option as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:

      (i) Any of the circumstances in paragraph (b)(3) of this section exist; or

      (ii) The order for the purchase or sale of a listed option is presented during a trading rotation in that listed option.

      (d)  The Commission may exempt from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any responsible broker or dealer, electronic communications network, national securities exchange, or national securities association if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors and the removal of impediments to and perfection of the mechanism of a national market system.

      § 242.603   Distribution, consolidation, dissemination, and display of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in NMS stocks.

#### § § 242.603

      (a)  (1) Any exclusive processor, or any broker or dealer with respect to information for which it is the exclusive source, that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to a securities information processor shall do so on terms that are fair and reasonable.

      (2) Any national securities exchange, national securities association, broker, or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to a securities information processor, broker, dealer, or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory.

      (b)  (1) Application of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section:

      (i) Compliance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section is required until the date indicated by the Commission in any order approving amendments to the effective national market system plan(s) to effectuate a cessation of the operations of the plan processors that disseminate consolidated information regarding NMS stocks.

      (ii) Compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section is required 180 calendar days from the date of the Commission's approval of the amendments, filed as required under § 242.614(e), to the effective national market system plan(s).

      (2) Every national securities exchange on which an NMS stock is traded and national securities association shall act jointly pursuant to one or more effective national market system plans for the dissemination of consolidated market data. Every national securities exchange on which an NMS stock is traded and national securities association shall make available to all competing consolidators and self-aggregators its information with respect to quotations for and transactions in NMS stocks, including all data necessary to generate consolidated market data, in the same manner and using the same methods, including all methods of access and the same format, as such national securities exchange or national securities association makes available any information with respect to quotations for and transactions in NMS stocks to any person.

      (3) Every national securities exchange on which an NMS stock is traded and national securities association shall act jointly pursuant to one or more effective national market system plans to disseminate consolidated information, including a national best bid and national best offer and odd-lot information, on quotations for and transactions in NMS stocks. Such plan or plans shall provide for the dissemination of all consolidated information for an individual NMS stock through a single plan processor and such single plan processor must represent quotation sizes in such consolidated information in terms of the number of shares, rounded down to the nearest multiple of a round lot. Every national securities exchange on which an NMS stock is traded and national securities association shall make available to a plan processor all data necessary to generate odd-lot information.

      (c)  (1) No securities information processor, broker, or dealer shall provide, in a context in which a trading or order-routing decision can be implemented, a display of any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock without also providing, in an equivalent manner, a consolidated display for such stock.

      (2) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a display of information on the trading floor or through the facilities of a national securities exchange or to a display in connection with the operation of a market linkage system implemented in accordance with an effective national market system plan.

#### § § 242.604

      (a)  For all NMS stocks:

      (1) Each member of a national securities exchange that is registered by that exchange as a specialist, or is authorized by that exchange to perform functions substantially similar to that of a specialist, shall publish immediately a bid or offer that reflects:

      (i) The price and the full size of each customer limit order held by the specialist that is at a price that would improve the bid or offer of such specialist in such security; and

      (ii) The full size of each customer limit order held by the specialist that:

      (A) Is priced equal to the bid or offer of such specialist for such security;

      (B) Is priced equal to the national best bid or national best offer; and

      (C) Represents more than a  change in relation to the size associated with the specialist's bid or offer.

      (2) Each registered broker or dealer that acts as an OTC market maker shall publish immediately a bid or offer that reflects:

      (i) The price and the full size of each customer limit order held by the OTC market maker that is at a price that would improve the bid or offer of such OTC market maker in such security; and

      (ii) The full size of each customer limit order held by the OTC market maker that:

      (A) Is priced equal to the bid or offer of such OTC market maker for such security;

      (B) Is priced equal to the national best bid or national best offer; and

      (C) Represents more than a  change in relation to the size associated with the OTC market maker's bid or offer.

      (b)  The requirements in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any customer limit order:

      (1) That is executed upon receipt of the order.

      (2) That is placed by a customer who expressly requests, either at the time that the order is placed or prior thereto pursuant to an individually negotiated agreement with respect to such customer's orders, that the order not be displayed.

      § 242.605   Disclosure of order execution information.

#### § § 242.605

      This section requires market centers, brokers, and dealers to make available standardized, monthly reports of statistical information concerning their order executions. This information is presented in accordance with uniform standards that are based on broad assumptions about order execution and routing practices. The information will provide a starting point to promote visibility and competition on the part of market centers and broker-dealers, particularly on the factors of execution price and speed. The disclosures required by this section do not encompass all of the factors that may be important to investors in evaluating the order routing services of a broker-dealer. In addition, any particular market center, broker, or dealer's statistics will encompass varying types of orders routed by different broker-dealers on behalf of customers with a wide range of objectives. Accordingly, the statistical information required by this section alone does not create a reliable basis to address whether any particular broker-dealer failed to obtain the most favorable terms reasonably available under the circumstances for customer orders.

      (a)  (1) Every market center, broker, or dealer shall make available for each calendar month, in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a report on the covered orders in NMS stocks that it received for execution from any person or that it received for execution in a prior calendar month but which remained open. Any OTC market maker that provides a trading system for only a single dealer to solely buy and sell securities against all other persons entering orders in that system shall produce a separate report pertaining only to covered orders entered in such trading system. Alternative trading systems (as defined in § 242.300(a)) shall prepare reports separately from their broker-dealer operators to the extent such entities are required to prepare reports. Each report shall be in electronic form; shall be categorized by security, order type, and order size; and shall include the following columns of information:

      (i) For market orders, marketable limit orders, marketable immediate-or-cancel orders, midpoint-or-better limit orders, midpoint-or-better limit orders that are immediate-or-cancel, executable non-marketable limit orders, executable non-marketable limit orders that are immediate-or-cancel, executable market orders submitted with stop prices, executable stop marketable limit orders, and executable stop non-marketable limit orders:

      (A) The number of covered orders;

      (B) The cumulative notional value of covered orders;

      (C) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders;

      (D) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders cancelled prior to execution;

      (E) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed at the receiving market center, broker, or dealer (excluding shares that the market center, broker, or dealer executes on a riskless principal basis);

      (F) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed at any other venue;

      (G) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed less than 100 microseconds after the time of order receipt; or, for non-marketable limit orders or orders submitted with stop prices, after the time the order becomes executable;

      (L) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed from 10 seconds to less than 30 seconds after the time of order receipt; or, for non-marketable limit orders or orders submitted with stop prices, after the time the order becomes executable;

      (M) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed from 30 seconds to less than 5 minutes after the time of order receipt; or, for non-marketable limit orders or orders submitted with stop prices, after the time the order becomes executable;

      (N) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed 5 minutes or more after the time of order receipt; or, for non-marketable limit orders or orders submitted with stop prices, after the time the order becomes executable;

      (O) For executions of covered orders, the average realized spread as calculated 50 milliseconds after the time of execution;

      (P) For executions of covered orders, the average percentage realized spread as calculated 50 milliseconds after the time of execution;

      (Q) For executions of covered orders, the average realized spread as calculated 1 second after the time of execution;

      (R) For executions of covered orders, the average percentage realized spread as calculated 1 second after the time of execution;

      (ii) For market orders, marketable limit orders, marketable immediate-or-cancel orders, midpoint-or-better limit orders, midpoint-or-better limit orders that are immediate-or-cancel, executable market orders submitted with stop prices, and executable stop marketable limit orders:

      (A) For executions of covered orders, the average quoted spread;

      (B) For executions of covered orders, the average effective spread;

      (C) For executions of covered orders, the average percentage effective spread;

      (D) For executions of covered orders, the average effective divided by the average quoted spread, expressed as a percentage;

      (E) The cumulative number of shares of covered orders executed with price improvement;

      (F) For shares executed with price improvement, the share-weighted average amount per share that prices were improved;

For purposes of this section, a broker or dealer that utilizes an omnibus clearing arrangement with respect to any of its underlying customer accounts shall be considered to carry such underlying customer accounts when calculating the number of customer accounts that it introduces or carries. Any broker or dealer that meets or exceeds this customer account threshold and is also a market center shall produce separate reports pertaining to each function.

#### § § 242.606

      (a)  (1) Every broker or dealer shall make publicly available for each calendar quarter a report on its routing of non-directed orders in NMS stocks that are submitted on a held basis and of non-directed orders that are customer orders in NMS securities that are option contracts during that quarter broken down by calendar month and keep such report posted on an internet website that is free and readily accessible to the public for a period of three years from the initial date of posting on the internet website.

Each section in a report shall include the following information:

      (i) The percentage of total orders for the section that were non-directed orders, and the percentages of total non-directed orders for the section that were market orders, marketable limit orders, non-marketable limit orders, and other orders;

Such disclosure shall be made available using the most recent versions of the XML schema and the associated PDF renderer as published on the Commission's website for all reports required by this section.

      (2) A broker or dealer shall notify customers in writing at least annually of the availability on request of the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (3) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, every broker or dealer shall, on request of a customer that places, directly or indirectly, one or more orders in NMS stocks that are submitted on a not held basis with the broker or dealer, disclose to such customer within seven business days of receiving the request, a report on its handling of such orders for that customer for the prior six months by calendar month. Such report shall be made available using the most recent versions of the XML schema and the associated PDF renderer as published on the Commission's website for all reports required by this section. For purposes of such report, the handling of a NMS stock order submitted by a customer to a broker-dealer on a not held basis includes the handling of all child orders derived from that order. Such report shall be divided into two sections: One for directed orders and one for non-directed orders. Each section of such report shall include, with respect to such order flow sent by the customer to the broker or dealer, the total number of shares sent to the broker or dealer by the customer during the relevant period; the total number of shares executed by the broker or dealer as principal for its own account; the total number of orders exposed by the broker or dealer through an actionable indication of interest; and the venue or venues to which orders were exposed by the broker or dealer through an actionable indication of interest, provided that, where applicable, a broker or dealer must disclose that it exposed a customer's order through an actionable indication of interest to other customers but need not disclose the identity of such customers. Each section of such report also shall include the following columns of information for each venue to which the broker or dealer routed such orders for the customer, in the aggregate:

      (D) Average net execution fee or rebate (cents per 100 shares, specified to four decimal places);

      (E) Total number of shares executed at the midpoint;

      (F) Percentage of shares executed at the midpoint;

      (G) Total number of shares executed that were priced on the side of the spread more favorable to the order;

      (H) Percentage of total shares executed that were priced at the side of the spread more favorable to the order;

      (I) Total number of shares executed that were priced on the side of the spread less favorable to the order; and

      (J) Percentage of total shares executed that were priced on the side of the spread less favorable to the order.

      (iii)  (A) Total number of shares executed of orders providing liquidity;

      (B) Percentage of shares executed of orders providing liquidity;

      (C) Average time between order entry and execution or cancellation, for orders providing liquidity (in milliseconds); and

      (D) Average net execution rebate or fee for shares of orders providing liquidity (cents per 100 shares, specified to four decimal places).

      (iv)  (A) Total number of shares executed of orders removing liquidity;

      (B) Percentage of shares executed of orders removing liquidity; and

      (C) Average net execution fee or rebate for shares of orders removing liquidity (cents per 100 shares, specified to four decimal places).

      (4) Except as provided below, no broker or dealer shall be required to provide reports pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the percentage of shares of not held orders in NMS stocks the broker or dealer received from its customers over the prior six calendar months was less than five percent of the total shares in NMS stocks the broker or dealer received from its customers during that time (the “five percent threshold” for purposes of this paragraph). A broker or dealer that equals or exceeds this five percent threshold shall be required (subject to paragraph (b)(5) of this section) to provide reports pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section for at least six calendar months (“Compliance Period”) regardless of the percentage of shares of not held orders in NMS stocks the broker or dealer receives from its customers during the Compliance Period. The Compliance Period shall begin the first calendar day of the next calendar month after the broker or dealer equaled or exceeded the five percent threshold, unless it is the first time the broker or dealer has equaled or exceeded the five percent threshold, in which case the Compliance Period shall begin the first calendar day four calendar months later. A broker or dealer shall not be required to provide reports pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section for orders that the broker or dealer did not receive during a Compliance Period. If, at any time after the end of a Compliance Period, the percentage of shares of not held orders in NMS stocks the broker or dealer received from its customers was less than five percent of the total shares in NMS stocks the broker or dealer received from its customers over the prior six calendar months, the broker or dealer shall not be required to provide reports pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except for orders that the broker or dealer received during the portion of a Compliance Period that remains covered by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (5) No broker or dealer shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to a customer that traded on average each month for the prior six months less than $1,000,000 of notional value of not held orders in NMS stocks through the broker or dealer.

      (c)  The Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of this section, if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors.

      (8)(i) A participant in an effective national market system plan shall ensure that a current and complete version of the plan is posted on a plan website or on a website designated by plan participants within two business days after notification by the Commission of effectiveness of the plan. Each participant in an effective national market system plan shall ensure that such website is updated to reflect amendments to such plan within two business days after the plan participants have been notified by the Commission of its approval of a proposed amendment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

No national market system plan, or any amendment thereto, shall become effective unless approved by the Commission or otherwise permitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (i)  The Commission shall send the notice of the filing of a national market system plan to the  for publication thereof under this paragraph (b)(1) within 90 days of the business day on which such plan was filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (iii) A national market system plan or proposed amendment has not been filed with the Commission for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1) if, not later than 7 business days after the business day of receipt by the Commission, the Commission notifies the plan participants that the filing of the national market system plan or proposed amendment does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section or plan filing requirements in other sections of Regulation NMS and part 240, subpart A of this chapter, except that if the Commission determines that the plan or amendment is unusually lengthy and is complex or raises novel regulatory issues, the Commission shall inform the plan participants of such determination not later than 7 business days after the business day of receipt by the Commission and, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the filing of such plan or amendment has not been made with the Commission if, not later than 21 days after the business day of receipt by the Commission, the Commission notifies the plan participants that the filing of such plan or amendment does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section or plan filing requirements in other sections of Regulation NMS and part 240, subpart A of this chapter.

      (iv) For purposes of this section, a “business day” is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, Federal holiday, a day that the Office of Personnel Management has announced that Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are closed to the public, a day on which the Commission is subject to a Federal government shutdown or a day on which the Commission's Washington, DC office is otherwise not open for regular business; provided further, a filing received by the Commission or a website posting made at or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, on a business day, shall be deemed received or made on that business day, and a filing received by the Commission or a website posting made after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, shall be deemed received or made on the next business day.

      (2) The Commission shall approve a national market system plan or proposed amendment to an effective national market system plan, with such changes or subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate, if it finds that such plan or amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission shall disapprove a national market system plan or proposed amendment if it does not make such a finding.

      (i) Within 90 days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of a national market system plan or proposed amendment, or within such longer period as to which the plan participants consent, the Commission shall, by order, approve or disapprove the plan or amendment, or institute proceedings to determine whether the plan or amendment should be disapproved. Proceedings to determine whether the plan or amendment should be disapproved will be conducted pursuant to 17 CFR 201.700 and 201.701. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within 180 days of the date of publication of notice of the plan or amendment. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission shall, by order, approve or disapprove the plan or amendment. The time for conclusion of such proceedings may be extended for up to 60 days (up to 240 days from the date of notice publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the plan participants consent to the longer period.

      (ii) The time for conclusion of proceedings to determine whether a national market system plan or proposed amendment should be disapproved may be extended for an additional period up to 60 days beyond the period set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (up to 300 days from the date of notice publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the plan participants consent to the longer period.

      (3) A proposed amendment may be put into effect upon filing with the Commission if designated by the sponsors as:

      (i) [Reserved]

      (ii) Concerned solely with the administration of the plan, or involving the governing or constituent documents relating to any person (other than a self-regulatory organization) authorized to implement or administer such plan on behalf of its sponsors; or

      (2) Application to the Commission for review, or the institution of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of any such action unless the Commission determines otherwise, after notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing may consist only of affidavits or oral arguments).

      (3) In any proceedings for review, if the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of consideration of the record of any proceedings conducted in connection with such action or failure to act and an opportunity for the presentation of reasons supporting or opposing such action or failure to act) and upon consideration of such other data, views, and arguments as it deems relevant, finds that the action or failure to act is in accordance with the applicable provisions of such plan and that the applicable provisions are, and were, applied in a manner consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the removal of impediments to, and the perfection of the mechanisms of a national market system, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding, or if it finds that such action or failure to act imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, the Commission, by order, shall set aside such action and/or require such action with respect to the matter reviewed as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system.

#### § § 242.611

      (a)  (1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent trade-throughs on that trading center of protected quotations in NMS stocks that do not fall within an exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and, if relying on such an exception, that are reasonably designed to assure compliance with the terms of the exception.

      (2) A trading center shall regularly surveil to ascertain the effectiveness of the policies and procedures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and shall take prompt action to remedy deficiencies in such policies and procedures.

      (b)  (1) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was effected when the trading center displaying the protected quotation that was traded through was experiencing a failure, material delay, or malfunction of its systems or equipment.

      (2) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was not a “regular way” contract.

      (3) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was a single-priced opening, reopening, or closing transaction by the trading center.

      (4) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was executed at a time when a protected bid was priced higher than a protected offer in the NMS stock.

      (5) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was the execution of an order identified as an intermarket sweep order.

      (6) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was effected by a trading center that simultaneously routed an intermarket sweep order to execute against the full displayed size of any protected quotation in the NMS stock that was traded through.

      (7) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was the execution of an order at a price that was not based, directly or indirectly, on the quoted price of the NMS stock at the time of execution and for which the material terms were not reasonably determinable at the time the commitment to execute the order was made.

      (8) The trading center displaying the protected quotation that was traded through had displayed, within one second prior to execution of the transaction that constituted the trade-through, a best bid or best offer, as applicable, for the NMS stock with a price that was equal or inferior to the price of the trade-through transaction.

      (9) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was the execution by a trading center of an order for which, at the time of receipt of the order, the trading center had guaranteed an execution at no worse than a specified price (a “stopped order”), where:

      (i) The stopped order was for the account of a customer;

      (ii) The customer agreed to the specified price on an order-by-order basis; and

      (iii) The price of the trade-through transaction was, for a stopped buy order, lower than the national best bid in the NMS stock at the time of execution or, for a stopped sell order, higher than the national best offer in the NMS stock at the time of execution.

      (c)  The trading center, broker, or dealer responsible for the routing of an intermarket sweep order shall take reasonable steps to establish that such order meets the requirements set forth in § 242.600(b)(47).

      (d)  The Commission, by order, may exempt from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any person, security, transaction, quotation, or order, or any class or classes of persons, securities, quotations, or orders, if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors.

      () Permit only persons designated by plan sponsors to have access to the data in the central repository;

      (C) The plan processor:

      (ii) Ensure the timeliness, accuracy, integrity, and completeness of the data provided to the central repository pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; and

      (iii) Ensure the accuracy of the consolidation by the plan processor of the data provided to the central repository pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (5) The national market system plan submitted pursuant to this section shall address whether there will be an annual independent evaluation of the security of the central repository and:

      (i) If so, provide a description of the scope of such planned evaluation; and

      (ii) If not, provide a detailed explanation of the alternative measures for evaluating the security of the central repository that are planned instead.

      (6) The national market system plan submitted pursuant to this section shall:

      (i) Specify a maximum error rate to be tolerated by the central repository for any data reported pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section; describe the basis for selecting such maximum error rate; explain how the plan sponsors will seek to reduce such maximum error rate over time; describe how the plan will seek to ensure compliance with such maximum error rate and, in the event of noncompliance, will promptly remedy the causes thereof;

      (ii) Require the central repository to measure the error rate each business day and promptly take appropriate remedial action, at a minimum, if the error rate exceeds the maximum error rate specified in the plan;

      (iii) Specify a process for identifying and correcting errors in the data reported to the central repository pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, including the process for notifying the national securities exchanges, national securities association, and members who reported erroneous data to the central repository of such errors, to help ensure that such errors are promptly corrected by the reporting entity, and for disciplining those who repeatedly report erroneous data; and

      (1) The submission complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) The security-based swap execution facility does not amend the proposed rule or supplement the submission, except as requested by the Commission, during the pendency of the review period, other than for correction of typographical errors, renumbering, or other non- substantive revisions.

      (d)  The Commission may further extend the review period in paragraph (c) of this section for:

      (1) An additional 45 days, if the proposed rule or rule amendment raises novel or complex issues that require additional time for review or is of major economic significance, the submission is incomplete, or the requestor does not respond completely to Commission questions in a timely manner, in which case the Commission shall notify the submitting security-based swap execution facility within the initial 45-day review period and shall briefly describe the nature of the specific issues for which additional time for review shall be required; or

      (2) Any period, beyond the additional 45 days provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to which the security-based swap execution facility agrees in writing.

      (f)  (1) Notification to a security-based swap execution facility under paragraph (e) of this section does not prevent the security-based swap execution facility from subsequently submitting a revised version of the proposed rule or rule amendment for Commission review and approval or from submitting the new rule or rule amendment as initially proposed in a supplemented submission. The revised submission will be reviewed without prejudice.

      (2) Notification to a security-based swap execution facility under paragraph (e) of this section of the Commission's determination not to approve a proposed rule or rule amendment shall be presumptive evidence that the security-based swap execution facility may not truthfully certify the same, or substantially the same, proposed rule or rule amendment under § 242.807(a).

      (a)  A security-based swap execution facility shall comply with the following conditions prior to implementing any rule—other than a rule delisting or withdrawing the certification of a product with no open interest and submitted in compliance with paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (6) of this section—that has not obtained Commission approval under § 242.806, or that remains a dormant rule subsequent to being submitted under this section or approved under § 242.806.

      (1) The security-based swap execution facility has filed its submission electronically with the Commission using the EFFS system.

      (2) The security-based swap execution facility has provided a certification that it posted a notice of pending certification with the Commission and a copy of the submission, concurrent with the filing of a submission with the Commission, on the security-based swap execution facility's website. Information that the security-based swap execution facility seeks to keep confidential may be redacted from the documents published on the security-based swap execution facility's website, but it must be republished consistent with any determination made pursuant to § 240.24b-2 of this chapter.

      (3) The Commission has received the submission not later than the open of business on the business day that is 10 business days prior to the security-based swap execution facility's implementation of the rule or rule amendment.

      (4) The Commission has not stayed the submission pursuant to § 242.807(c).

      (5) A new rule or rule amendment that establishes standards for responding to an emergency shall be submitted pursuant to § 242.807(a). A rule or rule amendment implemented under procedures of the governing board to respond to an emergency shall, if practicable, be filed with the Commission prior to implementation or, if not practicable, be filed with the Commission at the earliest possible time after implementation, but in no event more than 24 hours after implementation. Any such submission shall be subject to the certification and stay provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (6) The rule submission shall include:

      (i) A copy of the submission cover sheet in accordance with the instructions therein (in the case of a rule or rule amendment that responds to an emergency, “Emergency Rule Certification” should be noted in the description section of the submission cover sheet);

      (ii) The text of the rule (in the case of a rule amendment, deletions and additions must be indicated);

      (iii) The date of intended implementation;

      (iv) A certification by the security-based swap execution facility that the rule complies with the Act and the Commission's rules thereunder;

      (v) A concise explanation and analysis of the operation, purpose, and effect of the proposed rule or rule amendment and its compliance with applicable provisions of the Act, including core principles relating to security-based swap execution facilities and the Commission's rules thereunder;

      (vi) A brief explanation of any substantive opposing views expressed to the security-based swap execution facility by governing board or committee members, members of the security-based swap execution facility, or market participants, that were not incorporated into the rule, or a statement that no such opposing views were expressed; and

      (vii) As appropriate, a request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures provided in § 240.24b-2 of this chapter.

      (7) The security-based swap execution facility shall provide, if requested by Commission staff, additional evidence, information, or data that may be beneficial to the Commission in conducting a due diligence assessment of the filing and the security-based swap execution facility's compliance with any of the requirements of the Act or the Commission's rules or policies thereunder.

      (b)  The Commission shall have 10 business days to review the new rule or rule amendment before the new rule or rule amendment is deemed certified and can be made effective, unless the Commission notifies the security-based swap execution facility during the 10-business-day review period that it intends to issue a stay of the certification under paragraph (c) of this section.

      (c) —(1)  The Commission may stay the certification of a new rule or rule amendment submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by issuing a notification informing the security-based swap execution facility that the Commission is staying the certification of the rule or rule amendment on the grounds that the rule or rule amendment presents novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, the rule or rule amendment is accompanied by an inadequate explanation, or the rule or rule amendment is potentially inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder. The Commission will have an additional 90 days from the date of the notification to conduct the review.

      (2)  The Commission shall provide a 30-day comment period within the 90-day period in which the stay is in effect, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Commission shall publish a notice of the 30-day comment period on the Commission website. Comments from the public shall be submitted as specified in that notice.

      (3)  A new rule or rule amendment subject to a stay pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective, pursuant to the certification, at the expiration of the 90-day review period described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the Commission withdraws the stay prior to that time, or the Commission notifies the security-based swap execution facility during the 90-day time period that it objects to the proposed certification on the grounds that the proposed rule or rule amendment is inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder.

      (d)  Notwithstanding the rule certification requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a security-based swap execution facility may place the following rules or rule amendments into effect without certification to the Commission if the following conditions are met:

      (1) The security-based swap execution facility provides to the Commission at least weekly a summary notice of all rule amendments made effective pursuant to this paragraph during the preceding week. Such notice must be labeled “Weekly Notification of Rule Amendments” and need not be filed for weeks during which no such actions have been taken. One copy of each such submission shall be furnished electronically using the EFFS system; and

      (2) The rule governs:

      (i)  Corrections of typographical errors, renumbering, periodic routine updates to identifying information about the security-based swap execution facility, and other such non-substantive revisions of a product's terms and conditions that have no effect on the economic characteristics of the product;

      (ii)  Fees or fee changes, other than fees or fee changes associated with market making or trading incentive programs, that:

      (A) Total $1.00 or more per contract, and

      (B) Are established by an independent third party or are unrelated to delivery, trading, clearing, or dispute resolution.

      (iii)  Changes to lists of banks, brokers, dealers, or other entities that provide price or cash market information to an independent third party and that are incorporated by reference as product terms;

      (iv)  Changes in lists of approved brands or markings pursuant to previously certified or Commission approved standards or criteria;

      (3)  Notwithstanding the rule certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a security-based swap execution facility may place the following rules or rule amendments into effect without certification or notice to the Commission if the following conditions are met:

      (i) The security-based swap execution facility maintains documentation regarding all changes to rules; and

      (ii) The rule governs:

      (A)  Procedures and forms for the purchase, sale, or transfer of membership or ownership, but not including qualifications for membership or ownership, any right or obligation of membership or ownership, or dues or assessments;

      (B)  The organization and administrative procedures of a security-based swap execution facility's governing bodies such as a governing board, officers, and committees, but not voting requirements, governing board, or committee composition requirements or procedures, decision-making procedures, use or disclosure of material non-public information gained through the performance of official duties, or requirements relating to conflicts of interest;

      (C)  The routine daily administration, direction, and control of employees, requirements relating to gratuity and similar funds, but not guaranty, reserves, or similar funds; declaration of holidays; and changes to facilities housing the market, trading floor, or trading area;

      (D)  Standards of decorum or attire or similar provisions relating to admission to the floor, badges, or visitors, but not the establishment of penalties for violations of such rules;

      () Relate to matters such as dues, badges, telecommunication services, booth space, real-time quotations, historical information, publications, software licenses, or other matters that are administrative in nature; and

      (F)  The initial listing of trading months which are within the currently established cycle of trading months.

#### § § 242.811

      (a)  Upon the Commission's request, a security-based swap execution facility shall file with the Commission information related to its business as a security-based swap execution facility in the form and manner, and within the timeframe, specified by the Commission.

      (3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any aspect of an equity interest transfer described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires a security-based swap execution facility to file a rule, the security-based swap execution facility shall comply with the applicable rule filing requirements of § 242.806 or § 242.807.

      (4)  Upon an equity interest transfer described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the security-based swap execution facility shall file with the Commission, in a form and manner specified by the Commission, a certification that the security-based swap execution facility meets all of the requirements of section 3D of the Act and the Commission rules thereunder, no later than two business days following the date on which the equity interest of 50 percent or more was acquired.

      § 242.815   Methods of execution for Required and Permitted Transactions.

#### § § 242.815

      (a) —(1)  means any transaction involving a security-based swap that is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act.

      (2)  (i) Each Required Transaction that is not a block trade shall be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with one of the following methods of execution, except as provided in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section:

      (A) An order book; or

      (B) A request-for-quote system that operates in conjunction with an order book.

      (ii) In providing either one of the execution methods set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, a security-based swap execution facility may for purposes of execution and communication use any means of interstate commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, internet, email, and telephone, provided that the chosen execution method satisfies the requirements for order books in § 242.802 of this chapter or in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for request-for-quote systems.

      (3)  means a trading system or platform in which a market participant transmits a request for a quote to buy or sell a specific instrument to no less than three market participants in the trading system or platform, to which all such market participants may respond. The three market participants shall not be affiliates of or controlled by the requester and shall not be affiliates of or controlled by each other. A security-based swap execution facility that offers a request-for-quote system in connection with Required Transactions shall provide the following functionality:

      (i) At the same time that the requester receives the first responsive bid or offer, the security-based swap execution facility shall communicate to the requester any firm bid or offer pertaining to the same instrument resting on any of the security-based swap execution facility's order books;

      (ii) The security-based swap execution facility shall provide the requester with the ability to execute against such firm resting bids or offers along with any responsive orders; and

      (iii) The security-based swap execution facility shall ensure that its trading protocols provide each of its market participants with equal priority in receiving requests for quotes and in transmitting and displaying for execution responsive orders.

      (b) —(1)  With regard to Required Transactions, a security-based swap execution facility shall require that a broker or dealer who seeks to either execute against its customer's order or execute two of its customers' orders against each other through the security-based swap execution facility's order book, following some form of pre-arrangement or pre-negotiation of such orders, be subject to at least a 15-second time delay between the entry of those two orders into the order book, such that one side of the potential transaction is disclosed and made available to other market participants before the second side of the potential transaction, whether for the broker's or dealer's own account or for a second customer, is submitted for execution.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility may adjust the time period of the 15-second time delay requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, based upon a security-based swap's liquidity or other product-specific considerations; however, the time delay shall be set for a sufficient period of time so that an order is exposed to the market and other market participants have a meaningful opportunity to execute against such order.

      (c)  (1)  means any transaction not involving a security-based swap that is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility may offer any method of execution for each Permitted Transaction.

      (d)  (1) For purposes of this paragraph, a package transaction consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:

      (i) At least one component transaction is a Required Transaction;

      (ii) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and

      (iii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.

      (2) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component security-based swap that is subject exclusively to the Commission's jurisdiction, but is not subject to the clearing requirement under section 3C of the Act and is not intended to be cleared, may be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction;

      (3) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component that is not a security-based swap may be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction. This provision shall not apply to:

      (i) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are U.S. Treasury securities;

      (ii) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are contracts for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery;

      (iii) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are agency mortgage-backed securities;

      (iv) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component transaction that is the issuance of a bond in a primary market; and

      (v) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are swaps that are subject to a trade execution requirement under 17 CFR 37.9.

      (4) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component security-based swap that is not exclusively subject to the Commission's jurisdiction may be executed on a security-based swap in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction.

      (e)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain rules and procedures that facilitate the resolution of error trades. Such rules shall be fair, transparent, and consistent; allow for timely resolution; require members to provide prompt notice of an error trade—and, as applicable, offsetting and correcting trades—to the security-based swap execution facility; and permit members to:

      (i) Execute a correcting trade, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regardless of whether it is a Required or Permitted Transaction, for an error trade that has been rejected from clearing as soon as technologically practicable, but no later than one hour after a registered clearing agency provides notice of the rejection; or

      (ii) Execute an offsetting trade and a correcting trade, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regardless of whether it is a Required or Permitted Transaction, for an error trade that was accepted for clearing as soon as technologically practicable, but no later than three days after the error trade was accepted for clearing at a registered clearing agency.

      (2) If a correcting trade is rejected from clearing, then the security-based swap execution facility shall not allow the counterparties to execute another correcting trade.

      (f)  (1) Except as otherwise required under the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder, a security-based swap execution facility shall not directly or indirectly, including through a third-party service provider, disclose the identity of a counterparty to a security-based swap that is executed anonymously and intended to be cleared.

      (2) A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules that prohibit any person from directly or indirectly, including through a third-party service provider, disclosing the identity of a counterparty to a security-based swap that is executed anonymously and intended to be cleared.

      (3) For purposes of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, “executed anonymously” shall include a security-based swap that is pre-arranged or pre-negotiated anonymously, including by a member of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (4) For a package transaction that includes a component transaction that is not a security-based swap intended to be cleared, disclosing the identity of a counterparty shall not violate paragraphs (f)(1) or (2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a “package transaction” consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:

      (i) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and

      (ii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.

      (g)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules that provide that a security-based swap that is intended to be cleared at the time of the transaction, but is not accepted for clearing at a registered clearing agency, shall be void

      § 242.816   Trade execution requirement and exemptions therefrom.

#### § § 242.816

      (a) —(1)  A security-based swap execution facility that makes a security-based swap available to trade in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall submit to the Commission its determination with respect to such security-based swap as a rule, pursuant to the procedures under § 242.806 or § 242.807.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility that makes a security-based swap available to trade must demonstrate that it lists or offers that security-based swap for trading on its trading system or platform.

      (b)  To make a security-based swap available to trade for purposes of section 3C(h) of the Act, a security-based swap execution facility shall consider, as appropriate, the following factors with respect to such security-based swap:

      (1) Whether there are ready and willing buyers and sellers;

      (2) The frequency or size of transactions;

      (3) The trading volume;

      (4) The number and types of market participants;

      (5) The bid/ask spread; or

      (6) The usual number of resting firm or indicative bids and offers.

      (c)  Upon a determination that a security-based swap is available to trade on a security-based swap execution facility or national securities exchange, all other security-based swap execution facilities and SBS exchanges shall comply with the requirements of section 3C(h) of the Act in listing or offering such security-based swap for trading.

      (d)  The Commission may issue a determination that a security-based swap is no longer available to trade upon determining that no security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange lists such security-based swap for trading.

      (e)  (1) A security-based swap transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that also includes a component transaction that is the issuance of a bond in a primary market is exempt from the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a package transaction consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:

      (i) At least one component transaction is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act;

      (ii) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and

      (iii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.

      (2) Section 3C(h) of the Act does not apply to a security-based swap transaction that qualifies for an exception under section 3C(g) of the Act, or any exemption from the clearing requirement that is granted by the Commission, for which the associated requirements are met.

      (3)(i) Section 3C(h) of the Act does not apply to a security-based swap transaction that is executed between counterparties that qualify as “eligible affiliate counterparties,” as defined below.

      (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), counterparties will be “eligible affiliate counterparties” if:

      (A) One counterparty, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in the other counterparty, and the counterparty that holds the majority interest in the other counterparty reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the majority-owned counterparty; or

      (B) A third party, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in both counterparties, and the third party reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of both of the counterparties.

      (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), a counterparty or third party directly or indirectly holds a majority ownership interest if it directly or indirectly holds a majority of the equity securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution, or the contribution of, a majority of the capital of a partnership.

      § 242.819   Core Principle 2—Compliance with rules.

#### § § 242.819

      (a)  A security-based swap execution facility shall:

      (1) Establish and enforce compliance with any rule established by such security-based swap execution facility, including the terms and conditions of the security-based swaps traded or processed on or through the facility, and any limitation on access to the facility;

      (2) Establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules, including means to provide market participants with impartial access to the market and to capture information that may be used in establishing whether rule violations have occurred; and

      (3) Establish rules governing the operation of the facility, including rules specifying trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded or posted on the facility.

      (b)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall establish rules governing the operation of the security-based swap execution facility, including, but not limited to, rules specifying trading procedures to be followed by members when entering and executing orders traded or posted on the security-based swap execution facility.

      (2) A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and impartially enforce compliance with the rules of the security-based swap execution facility, including, but not limited to:

      (i) The terms and conditions of any security-based swaps traded or processed on or through the security-based swap execution facility;

      (ii) Access to the security-based swap execution facility;

      (iii) Trade practice rules;

      (iv) Audit trail requirements;

      (v) Disciplinary rules; and

      (vi) Mandatory trading requirements.

      (c) —(1)  A security-based swap execution facility shall provide any eligible contract participant and any independent software vendor with impartial access to its market(s) and market services, including any indicative quote screens or any similar pricing data displays, provided that the facility has:

      (i) Criteria governing such access that are impartial, transparent, and applied in a fair and non-discriminatory manner;

      (ii) Procedures whereby eligible contract participants provide the security-based swap execution facility with written or electronic confirmation of their status as eligible contract participants, as defined by the Act and Commission rules thereunder, prior to obtaining access; and

      (iii) Comparable fee structures for eligible contract participants and independent software vendors receiving comparable access to, or services from, the security-based swap execution facility.

      (2)  Prior to granting any eligible contract participant access to its facilities, a security-based swap execution facility shall require that the eligible contract participant consent to its jurisdiction.

      (3)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and impartially enforce rules governing any decision to allow, deny, suspend, or permanently bar an eligible contract participant's access to the security-based swap execution facility, including when a decision is made as part of a disciplinary or emergency action taken by the security-based swap execution facility.

      (4) —(i)  An application for review by the Commission may be filed by any person who is aggrieved by a determination of a security-based swap execution facility with respect to any final action with respect to a denial or limitation of access to any service offered by the security-based swap execution facility or any final action with respect to a denial or conditioning of membership, as defined in § 242.835(b)(2) of this chapter (Rule 835(b)(2)), in accordance with § 201.442 of this chapter (Rule of Practice 442).

      (ii)  In reviewing such a determination, if the Commission finds that the specific grounds on which such denial, limitation, or conditioning is based exist in fact, that such denial, limitation, or conditioning is in accordance with the rules of the security-based swap execution facility, and that such rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding or if it finds that such denial, limitation, or conditioning imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Commission, by order, shall set aside the action of the security-based swap execution facility and require it to admit such person to membership or participation or grant such person access to services offered by the security-based swap execution facility.

      (d)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and it shall have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules.

      (1)  A security-based swap execution facility shall prohibit abusive trading practices on its markets by members. A security-based swap execution facility that permits intermediation shall prohibit customer-related abuses including, but not limited to, trading ahead of customer orders, trading against customer orders, accommodation trading, and improper cross trading. Specific trading practices that shall be prohibited include front-running, wash trading, pre-arranged trading (except for transactions approved by or certified to the Commission pursuant § 242.806 or § 242.807, respectively), fraudulent trading, money passes, and any other trading practices that a security-based swap execution facility deems to be abusive. A security-based swap execution facility shall also prohibit any other manipulative or disruptive trading practices prohibited by the Act or by the Commission pursuant to Commission regulation.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility shall have arrangements and resources for effective enforcement of its rules. Such arrangements shall include the authority to collect information and documents on both a routine and non-routine basis, including the authority to examine books and records kept by the security-based swap execution facility's members and by persons under investigation. A security-based swap execution facility's arrangements and resources shall also facilitate the direct supervision of the market and the analysis of data collected to determine whether a rule violation has occurred.

      (3)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and maintain sufficient compliance staff and resources to ensure that it can conduct effective audit trail reviews, trade practice surveillance, market surveillance, and real-time market monitoring. The security-based swap execution facility's compliance staff shall also be sufficient to address unusual market or trading events as they arise, and to conduct and complete investigations in a timely manner, as set forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.

      (4)  A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain an automated trade surveillance system capable of detecting potential trade practice violations. The automated trade surveillance system shall load and process daily orders and trades no later than 24 hours after the completion of the trading day. The automated trade surveillance system shall have the capability to detect and flag specific trade execution patterns and trade anomalies; compute, retain, and compare trading statistics; reconstruct the sequence of market activity; perform market analyses; and support system users to perform in-depth analyses and ad hoc queries of trade-related data.

      (5)  A security-based swap execution facility shall conduct real-time market monitoring of all trading activity on its system(s) or platform(s) to identify any market or system anomalies. A security-based swap execution facility shall have the authority to adjust trade prices or cancel trades when necessary to mitigate market disrupting events caused by malfunctions in its system(s) or platform(s) or errors in orders submitted by members. Any trade price adjustments or trade cancellations shall be transparent to the market and subject to standards that are clear, fair, and publicly available.

      (6) —(i)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and maintain procedures that require its compliance staff to conduct investigations of possible rule violations. An investigation shall be commenced upon the receipt of a request from Commission staff or upon the discovery or receipt of information by the security-based swap execution facility that indicates a reasonable basis for finding that a violation may have occurred or will occur.

      (ii)  Each compliance staff investigation shall be completed in a timely manner. Absent mitigating factors, a timely manner is no later than 12 months after the date that an investigation is opened. Mitigating factors that may reasonably justify an investigation taking longer than 12 months to complete include the complexity of the investigation, the number of firms or individuals involved as potential wrongdoers, the number of potential violations to be investigated, and the volume of documents and data to be examined and analyzed by compliance staff.

      (iii)  Compliance staff shall submit a written investigation report for disciplinary action in every instance in which compliance staff determines from surveillance or from an investigation that a reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation. The investigation report shall include the reason the investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant facts; compliance staff's analysis and conclusions; and a recommendation as to whether disciplinary action should be pursued.

      (iv)  If after conducting an investigation, compliance staff determines that no reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation, it shall prepare a written report including the reason the investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant facts; and compliance staff's analysis and conclusions.

      (v)  The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may authorize its compliance staff to issue a warning letter to a person or entity under investigation or to recommend that a disciplinary panel take such an action. No more than one warning letter may be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same rule violation within a rolling 12-month period.

      (e) —(1)  A security-based swap execution facility may choose to contract with a registered futures association (under section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act), a board of trade designated as a contract market (under section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act), a national securities exchange, a national securities association, or another security-based swap execution facility (each a “regulatory service provider”), for the provision of services to assist in complying with the Act and Commission rules thereunder, as approved by the Commission. A security-based swap execution facility that chooses to contract with a regulatory service provider shall ensure that such provider has the capacity and resources necessary to provide timely and effective regulatory services, including adequate staff and automated surveillance systems. A security-based swap execution facility shall at all times remain responsible for the performance of any regulatory services received, for compliance with the security-based swap execution facility's obligations under the Act and Commission rules thereunder, and for the regulatory service provider's performance on its behalf.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility that elects to use the service of a regulatory service provider shall retain sufficient compliance staff to supervise the quality and effectiveness of the regulatory services provided on its behalf. Compliance staff of the security-based swap execution facility shall hold regular meetings with the regulatory service provider to discuss ongoing investigations, trading patterns, market participants, and any other matters of regulatory concern. A security-based swap execution facility shall also conduct periodic reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of services provided on its behalf. Such reviews shall be documented carefully and made available to the Commission upon request.

      (3)  A security-based swap execution facility that elects to use the service of a regulatory service provider shall retain exclusive authority in all substantive decisions made by its regulatory service provider, including, but not limited to, decisions involving the cancellation of trades, the issuance of disciplinary charges against members, and denials of access to the trading platform for disciplinary reasons. A security-based swap execution facility shall document any instances where its actions differ from those recommended by its regulatory service provider, including the reasons for the course of action recommended by the regulatory service provider and the reasons why the security-based swap execution facility chose a different course of action.

      (f)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish procedures to capture and retain information that may be used in establishing whether rule violations have occurred.

      (1)  A security-based swap execution facility shall capture and retain all audit trail data necessary to detect, investigate, and prevent customer and market abuses. Such data shall be sufficient to reconstruct all indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades within a reasonable period of time and to provide evidence of any violations of the rules of the security-based swap execution facility. An acceptable audit trail shall also permit the security-based swap execution facility to track a customer order from the time of receipt through execution on the security-based swap execution facility.

      (2) —(i)  A security-based swap execution facility's audit trail shall include original source documents. Original source documents include unalterable, sequentially identified records on which trade execution information is originally recorded, whether recorded manually or electronically. Records for customer orders (whether filled, unfilled, or cancelled, each of which shall be retained or electronically captured) shall reflect the terms of the order, an account identifier that relates back to the account's owner(s), the time of order entry, and the time of trade execution. A security-based swap execution facility shall require that all orders, indications of interest, and requests for quotes be immediately captured in the audit trail.

      (ii)  A security-based swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include an electronic transaction history database. An adequate transaction history database shall include a history of all indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades entered into a security-based swap execution facility's trading system or platform, including all order modifications and cancellations. An adequate transaction history database shall also include:

      (A) All data that are input into the trade entry or matching system for the transaction to match and clear;

      (B) The customer type indicator code; and

      (C) Timing and sequencing data adequate to reconstruct trading.

      (iii)  A security-based swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include electronic analysis capability with respect to all audit trail data in the transaction history database. Such electronic analysis capability shall ensure that the security-based swap execution facility has the ability to reconstruct indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades, and identify possible trading violations with respect to both customer and market abuse.

      (iv)  A security-based swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include the capability to safely store all audit trail data retained in its transaction history database. Such safe-storage capability shall include the capability to store all data in the database in a manner that protects it from unauthorized alteration, as well as from accidental erasure or other loss. Data shall be retained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of § 242.826 (Core Principle 9).

      (3) —(i)  A security-based swap execution facility shall enforce its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements through at least annual reviews of all members and persons and firms subject to the security-based swap execution facility's recordkeeping rules to verify their compliance with the security-based swap execution facility's audit trail and recordkeeping requirements. Such reviews shall include, but are not limited to, reviews of randomly selected samples of front-end audit trail data for order routing systems; a review of the process by which user identifications are assigned and user identification records are maintained; a review of usage patterns associated with user identifications to monitor for violations of user identification rules; and reviews of account numbers and customer type indicator codes in trade records to test for accuracy and improper use.

      (ii)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish a program for effective enforcement of its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements. An effective program shall identify members, persons, and firms subject to the security-based swap execution facility's recordkeeping rules that have failed to maintain high levels of compliance with such requirements, and impose meaningful sanctions when deficiencies are found. Sanctions shall be sufficient to deter recidivist behavior. No more than one warning letter shall be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same violation of audit trail or recordkeeping requirements within a rolling 12-month period.

      (g)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and have the capacity to enforce such rules through prompt and effective disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion of members that violate the rules of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (1)  (i) A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and maintain sufficient enforcement staff and resources to effectively and promptly prosecute possible rule violations within the disciplinary jurisdiction of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (ii) The enforcement staff of a security-based swap execution facility shall not include members or other persons whose interests conflict with their enforcement duties.

      (iii) A member of the enforcement staff shall not operate under the direction or control of any person or persons with trading privileges at the security-based swap execution facility.

      (iv) The enforcement staff of a security-based swap execution facility may operate as part of the security-based swap execution facility's compliance department.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish one or more disciplinary panels that are authorized to fulfill their obligations under the rules of this section. Disciplinary panels shall meet the composition requirements of § 242.834(d), and shall not include any members of the security-based swap execution facility's compliance staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding.

      (3)  If compliance staff authorized by a security-based swap execution facility or disciplinary panel thereof determines that a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation and adjudication is warranted, it shall direct that the person or entity alleged to have committed the violation be served with a notice of charges. A notice of charges shall adequately state the acts, conduct, or practices in which the respondent is alleged to have engaged; state the rule or rules alleged to have been violated (or about to be violated); advise the respondent that it is entitled, upon request, to a hearing on the charges; and prescribe the period within which a hearing on the charges may be requested. If the rules of the security-based swap execution facility so provide, a notice may also advise:

      (i) That failure to request a hearing within the period prescribed in the notice, except for good cause, may be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing; and

      (ii) That failure to answer or to deny expressly a charge may be deemed to be an admission of such charge.

      (4)  Upon being served with a notice of charges, a respondent shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all succeeding stages of the disciplinary process, except by any member of the security-based swap execution facility's governing board or disciplinary panel, any employee of the security-based swap execution facility, or any person substantially related to the underlying investigations, such as a material witness or respondent.

      (5)  A respondent shall be given a reasonable period of time to file an answer to a notice of charges. The rules of a security-based swap execution facility governing the requirements and timeliness of a respondent's answer to a notice of charges shall be fair, equitable, and publicly available.

      (6)  The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may provide that, if a respondent admits or fails to deny any of the charges, a disciplinary panel may find that the violations alleged in the notice of charges for which the respondent admitted or failed to deny any of the charges have been committed. If the security-based swap execution facility's rules so provide, then:

      (i) The disciplinary panel may impose a sanction for each violation found to have been committed;

      (ii) The disciplinary panel shall promptly notify the respondent in writing of any sanction to be imposed and shall advise the respondent that the respondent may request a hearing on such sanction within the period of time, which shall be stated in the notice; and

      (iii) The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may provide that, if a respondent fails to request a hearing within the period of time stated in the notice, the respondent will be deemed to have accepted the sanction.

      (7)  Where a respondent has requested a hearing on a charge that is denied, or on a sanction set by the disciplinary panel, the respondent shall be given an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the rules of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (8)  (i) The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may permit a respondent to submit a written offer of settlement at any time after an investigation report is completed. The disciplinary panel presiding over the matter may accept the offer of settlement, but may not alter the terms of a settlement offer unless the respondent agrees.

      (ii) The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may provide that, in its discretion, a disciplinary panel may permit the respondent to accept a sanction without either admitting or denying the rule violations upon which the sanction is based.

      (iii) If an offer of settlement is accepted, the panel accepting the offer shall issue a written decision specifying the rule violations it has reason to believe were committed, including the basis or reasons for the panel's conclusions, and any sanction to be imposed, which shall include full customer restitution where customer harm is demonstrated, except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided cannot be reasonably determined. If an offer of settlement is accepted without the agreement of the enforcement staff, the decision shall adequately support the disciplinary panel's acceptance of the settlement. Where applicable, the decision shall also include a statement that the respondent has accepted the sanctions imposed without either admitting or denying the rule violations.

      (iv) The respondent may withdraw its offer of settlement at any time before final acceptance by a disciplinary panel. If an offer is withdrawn after submission, or is rejected by a disciplinary panel, the respondent shall not be deemed to have made any admissions by reason of the offer of settlement and shall not be otherwise prejudiced by having submitted the offer of settlement.

      (9)  A security-based swap execution facility shall adopt rules that provide for the following minimum requirements for any hearing:

      (i) The hearing shall be fair, shall be conducted before members of the disciplinary panel, and shall be promptly convened after reasonable notice to the respondent. A security-based swap execution facility need not apply the formal rules of evidence for a hearing; nevertheless, the procedures for the hearing may not be so informal as to deny a fair hearing;

      (ii) No member of the disciplinary panel for the hearing may have a financial, personal, or other direct interest in the matter under consideration;

      (iii) In advance of the hearing, the respondent shall be entitled to examine all books, documents, or other evidence in the possession or under the control of the security-based swap execution facility. The security-based swap execution facility may withhold documents that are privileged or constitute attorney work product; were prepared by an employee of the security-based swap execution facility but will not be offered in evidence in the disciplinary proceedings; may disclose a technique or guideline used in examinations, investigations, or enforcement proceedings; or disclose the identity of a confidential source;

      (iv) The security-based swap execution facility's enforcement and compliance staffs shall be parties to the hearing, and the enforcement staff shall present their case on those charges and sanctions that are the subject of the hearing;

      (v) The respondent shall be entitled to appear personally at the hearing, to cross-examine any persons appearing as witnesses at the hearing, to call witnesses, and to present such evidence as may be relevant to the charges;

      (vi) The security-based swap execution facility shall require persons within its jurisdiction who are called as witnesses to participate in the hearing and produce evidence. The security-based swap execution facility shall make reasonable efforts to secure the presence of all other persons called as witnesses whose testimony would be relevant. The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may provide that a sanction may be summarily imposed upon any person within its jurisdiction whose actions impede the progress of a hearing; and

      (vii) If the respondent has requested a hearing, a copy of the hearing shall be made and shall become a part of the record of the proceeding. The record shall not be required to be transcribed unless:

      (A) The transcript is requested by Commission staff or the respondent;

      (B) The decision is appealed pursuant to the rules of the security-based swap execution facility; or

      (C) The decision is reviewed by the Commission pursuant to § 201.442 of this chapter. In all other instances, a summary record of a hearing is permitted.

      (10)  Promptly following a hearing conducted in accordance with the rules of the security-based swap execution facility, the disciplinary panel shall render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and shall provide a copy to the respondent. The decision shall include:

      (i) The notice of charges or a summary of the charges;

      (ii) The answer, if any, or a summary of the answer;

      (iii) A summary of the evidence produced at the hearing or, where appropriate, incorporation by reference of the investigation report;

      (iv) A statement of findings and conclusions with respect to each charge and a complete explanation of the evidentiary and other basis for such findings and conclusions with respect to each charge;

      (v) An indication of each specific rule that the respondent was found to have violated; and

      (vi) A declaration of all sanctions imposed against the respondent, including the basis for such sanctions and the effective date of such sanctions.

      (11)  (i) A security-based swap execution facility may impose a sanction, including suspension, or take other summary action against a person or entity subject to its jurisdiction upon a reasonable belief that such immediate action is necessary to protect the best interest of the market place.

      (ii) Any emergency disciplinary action shall be taken in accordance with a security-based swap execution facility's procedures that provide for the following:

      (A) If practicable, a respondent should be served with a notice before the action is taken, or otherwise at the earliest possible opportunity. The notice shall state the action, briefly state the reasons for the action, and state the effective time and date, and the duration of the action.

      (B) The respondent shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all proceedings subsequent to the emergency action taken. The respondent shall be given the opportunity for a hearing as soon as reasonably practicable and the hearing shall be conducted before the disciplinary panel pursuant to the rules of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (C) Promptly following the hearing, the security-based swap execution facility shall render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and shall provide a copy to the respondent. The decision shall include a description of the summary action taken; the reasons for the summary action; a summary of the evidence produced at the hearing; a statement of findings and conclusions; a determination that the summary action should be affirmed, modified, or reversed; and a declaration of any action to be taken pursuant to the determination, and the effective date and duration of such action.

      (12)  The rules of a security-based swap execution facility may permit the parties to a proceeding to appeal promptly an adverse decision of a disciplinary panel in all or in certain classes of cases. Such rules may require a party's notice of appeal to be in writing and to specify the findings, conclusions, or sanctions to which objection are taken. If the rules of a security-based swap execution facility permit appeals, then both the respondent and the enforcement staff shall have the opportunity to appeal and:

      (i) The security-based swap execution facility shall establish an appellate panel that is authorized to hear appeals. The rules of the security-based swap execution facility may provide that the appellate panel may, on its own initiative, order review of a decision by a disciplinary panel within a reasonable period of time after the decision has been rendered;

      (ii) The composition of the appellate panel shall be consistent with § 242.834(d) and shall not include any members of the security-based swap execution facility's compliance staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding. The rules of a security-based swap execution facility shall provide for the appeal proceeding to be conducted before all of the members of the appellate panel or a panel thereof;

      (iii) Except for good cause shown, the appeal or review shall be conducted solely on the record before the disciplinary panel, the written exceptions filed by the parties, and the oral or written arguments of the parties; and

      (iv) Promptly following the appeal or review proceeding, the appellate panel shall issue a written decision and shall provide a copy to the respondent. The decision issued by the appellate panel shall adhere to all the requirements of paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the extent that a different conclusion is reached from that issued by the disciplinary panel.

      (13) —(i)  All disciplinary sanctions imposed by a security-based swap execution facility or its disciplinary panels shall be commensurate with the violations committed and shall be clearly sufficient to deter recidivism or similar violations by other members. All disciplinary sanctions, including sanctions imposed pursuant to an accepted settlement offer, shall take into account the respondent's disciplinary history. In the event of demonstrated customer harm, any disciplinary sanction shall also include full customer restitution, except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided cannot be reasonably determined.

      (ii)  A security-based swap execution facility may adopt a summary fine schedule for violations of rules relating to the failure to timely submit accurate records required for clearing or verifying each day's transactions. A security-based swap execution facility may permit its compliance staff, or a designated panel of security-based swap execution facility officials, to summarily impose minor sanctions against persons within the security-based swap execution facility's jurisdiction for violating such rules. A security-based swap execution facility's summary fine schedule may allow for warning letters to be issued for first-time violations or violators. If adopted, a summary fine schedule shall provide for progressively larger fines for recurring violations.

      (14) —(i)  An application for review by the Commission may be filed by any person who is aggrieved by a determination of a security-based swap facility with respect to any final disciplinary action, as defined in § 242.835(b)(1) of this chapter (Rule 835(b)(1)), in accordance with § 201.442 of this chapter (Rule of Practice 442).

      (ii)  (A) In reviewing such a determination, if the Commission finds that such person has engaged in such acts or practices, or has omitted such acts, as the security-based swap execution facility has found him to have engaged in or omitted, that such acts or practices, or omissions to act, are in violation of the Exchange Act, the rules or regulations thereunder, or the rules of the security-based swap execution facility, and that such provisions are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of Exchange Act, the Commission, by order, shall so declare and, as appropriate, affirm the sanction imposed by the security-based swap execution facility, modify the sanction in accordance with paragraph (C) of this subsection, or remand to the security-based swap execution facility for further proceedings; or

      (B) if the Commission does not make any such finding it shall, by order, set aside the sanction imposed by the security-based swap execution facility and, if appropriate, remand to the security-based swap execution facility for further proceedings.

      (C) If the Commission, having due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, finds that a sanction imposed by a security-based swap execution facility upon such person imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act or is excessive or oppressive, the Commission may cancel, reduce, or require the remission of such sanction.

      (h) —(1)  The following definitions shall apply only in this paragraph (h):

      (i)  with respect to a security-based swap execution facility, means:

      (A) A security-based swap that trades on the security-based swap execution facility;

      (B) A security of an issuer that has issued a security that underlies a security-based swap that is listed on that facility; or

      (C) A derivative based on a security that falls within paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (ii)  means an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in which no covered interest constitutes more than 10 percent of the investment company's assets.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility must maintain in effect rules which have been submitted to the Commission pursuant to § 242.806 or § 242.807 that, at a minimum, prohibit an employee of the security-based swap execution facility from:

      (i) Trading, directly or indirectly, any covered interest; and

      (ii) Disclosing to any other person any material, non-public information which such employee obtains as a result of their employment at the security-based swap execution facility, where such employee has or should have a reasonable expectation that the information disclosed may assist another person in trading any covered interest; provided, however, that such rules shall not prohibit disclosures made in the course of an employee's duties, or disclosures made to another security-based swap execution facility, court of competent jurisdiction, or representative of any agency or department of the Federal or State government acting in their official capacity.

      (3)  A security-based swap execution facility may adopt rules, which must be submitted to the Commission pursuant to § 242.806 or § 242.807, which set forth circumstances under which exemptions from the trading prohibition contained in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section may be granted; such exemptions are to be administered by the security-based swap execution facility on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, such circumstances may include:

      (i) Participation by an employee in a pooled investment vehicle where the employee has no direct or indirect control with respect to transactions executed for or on behalf of such vehicle;

      (ii) Trading by an employee in a derivative based on a pooled investment vehicle that falls within paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section;

      (iii) Trading by an employee in a derivative based on an index in which no covered interest constitutes more than 10 percent of the index; and

      (iv) Trading by an employee under circumstances enumerated by the security-based swap execution facility in rules which the security-based swap execution facility determines are not contrary to applicable law, the public interest, or just and equitable principles of trade.

      (4)  (i) No employee, governing board member, committee member, or consultant of a security-based swap execution facility shall:

      (A) Trade for such person's own account, or for or on behalf of any other account, in any covered interest on the basis of any material, non-public information obtained through special access related to the performance of such person's official duties as an employee, governing board member, committee member, or consultant; or

      (B) Disclose for any purpose inconsistent with the performance of such person's official duties as an employee, governing board member, committee member, or consultant any material, non-public information obtained through special access related to the performance of such duties.

      (ii) No person shall trade for such person's own account, or for or on behalf of any other account, in any covered interest on the basis of any material, non-public information that such person knows was obtained in violation of this paragraph (h)(4) from an employee, governing board member, committee member, or consultant.

      (i)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain in effect rules which have been submitted to the Commission pursuant to § 242.806 or § 242.807 that render a person ineligible to serve on its disciplinary committees, arbitration panels, oversight panels, or governing board who:

      (i) Was found within the prior three years by a final decision of a security-based swap execution facility, a self-regulatory organization, an administrative law judge, a court of competent jurisdiction, or the Commission to have committed a disciplinary offense;

      (ii) Entered into a settlement agreement with a security-based swap execution facility, a court of competent jurisdiction, or the Commission within the prior three years in which any of the findings or, in the absence of such findings, any of the acts charged included a disciplinary offense;

      (v) Currently is subject to or has had imposed on him or her within the prior three years a Commission registration revocation or suspension in any capacity for any reason, or has been convicted within the prior three years of any felony; or

      (vi) Currently is subject to a denial, suspension, or disqualification from serving on a disciplinary committee, arbitration panel, or governing board of any security-based swap execution facility or self-regulatory organization.

      (2) No person may serve on a disciplinary committee, arbitration panel, oversight panel or governing board of a security-based swap execution facility if such person is subject to any of the conditions listed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.

      (3) A security-based swap execution facility shall submit to the Commission a schedule listing all those rule violations which constitute disciplinary offenses and, to the extent necessary to reflect revisions, shall submit an amended schedule within 30 days of the end of each calendar year. A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain and keep current the schedule required by this section, and post the schedule on the security-based swap execution facility's website so that it is in a public place designed to provide notice to members and otherwise ensure its availability to the general public.

      (4) A security-based swap execution facility shall submit to the Commission within 30 days of the end of each calendar year a certified list of any persons who have been removed from its disciplinary committees, arbitration panels, oversight panels, or governing board pursuant to the requirements of this section during the prior year.

      (5) Whenever a security-based swap execution facility finds by final decision that a person has committed a disciplinary offense and such finding makes such person ineligible to serve on that security-based swap execution facility's disciplinary committees, arbitration panels, oversight panels, or governing board, the security-based swap execution facility shall inform the Commission of that finding and the length of the ineligibility in a form and manner specified by the Commission.

      (6) For purposes of this paragraph:

      (iii)  means:

      (A) A decision of a security-based swap execution facility which cannot be further appealed within the security-based swap execution facility, is not subject to the stay of the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, and has not been reversed by the Commission or any court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (B) Any decision by an administrative law judge, a court of competent jurisdiction, or the Commission which has not been stayed or reversed.

      (i) The security-based swap execution facility shall promptly provide written notice of the disciplinary action to the member; and

      (ii) The security-based swap execution facility shall have established a rule pursuant to § 242.806 or § 242.807 that requires a member that receives such a notice to promptly provide written notice of the disciplinary action to the customer, as disclosed on the member's books and records.

      (2) A written notice required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section must include the principal facts of the disciplinary action and a statement that the security-based swap execution facility has found that the member has committed a rule violation that involved a transaction for the customer, whether executed or not, and that resulted in financial harm to the customer.

      (3) Solely for purposes of this paragraph (j):

      (i)  means a person that utilizes an agent in connection with trading on a security-based swap execution facility.

      (ii)  means any decision by or settlement with a security-based swap execution facility in a disciplinary matter which cannot be further appealed at the security-based swap execution facility, is not subject to the stay of the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, and has not been reversed by the Commission or any court of competent jurisdiction.

      (k)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility that admits a non-U.S. person as a member shall be deemed to be the agent of the non-U.S. member with respect to any security-based swaps executed by the non-U.S. member. Service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the security-based swap execution facility shall constitute valid and effective service upon the non-U.S. member. The security-based swap execution facility which has been served with, or to which there has been delivered, a communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a non-U.S. member shall transmit the communication promptly and in a manner which is reasonable under the circumstances, or in a manner specified by the Commission in the communication, to the non-U.S. member.

      (2) It shall be unlawful for a security-based swap execution facility to permit a non-U.S. member to execute security-based swaps on the facility unless the security-based swap execution facility prior thereto informs the non-U.S. member in writing of the requirements of this section.

      (3) The requirements of paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply if the non-U.S. member has duly executed and maintains in effect a written agency agreement in compliance with this paragraph with a person domiciled in the United States and has provided a copy of the agreement to the security-based swap execution facility prior to effecting any transaction on the security-based swap execution facility. This agreement must authorize the person domiciled in the United States to serve as the agent of the non-U.S. member for purposes of accepting delivery and service of all communications issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the non-U.S. member and must provide an address in the United States where the agent will accept delivery and service of communications from the Commission. This agreement must be filed with the Commission by the security-based swap execution facility prior to permitting the non-U.S. member to effect any transactions in security-based swaps. Such agreements shall be filed in a manner specified by the Commission.

      (4) A non-U.S. member shall notify the Commission immediately if the written agency agreement is terminated, revoked, or is otherwise no longer in effect. If the security-based swap execution facility knows or should know that the agreement has expired, been terminated, or is no longer in effect, the security-based swap execution facility shall notify the Commission immediately.

      § 242.820   Core Principle 3—Security-based swaps not readily susceptible to manipulation.

#### § § 242.820

      The security-based swap execution facility shall permit trading only in security-based swaps that are not readily susceptible to manipulation.

      § 242.821   Core Principle 4—Monitoring of trading and trade processing.

#### § § 242.821

      (a)  The security-based swap execution facility shall:

      (1) Establish and enforce rules or terms and conditions defining, or specifications detailing:

      (i) Trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded on or through the facilities of the security-based swap execution facility; and

      (ii) Procedures for trade processing of security-based swaps on or through the facilities of the security-based swap execution facility; and

      (2) Monitor trading in security-based swaps to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the delivery or cash settlement process through surveillance, compliance, and disciplinary practices and procedures, including methods for conducting real-time monitoring of trading and comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.

      (b)  A security-based swap execution facility shall:

      (1) Collect and evaluate data on its members' market activity on an ongoing basis in order to detect and prevent manipulation, price distortions, and, where possible, disruptions of the physical-delivery or cash-settlement process;

      (2) Monitor and evaluate general market data in order to detect and prevent manipulative activity that would result in the failure of the market price to reflect the normal forces of supply and demand;

      (3) Demonstrate an effective program for conducting real-time monitoring of trading for the purpose of detecting and resolving abnormalities. A security-based swap execution facility shall employ automated alerts to detect abnormal price movements and unusual trading volumes in real time and instances or threats of manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions on at least a T + 1 basis. The T + 1 detection and analysis should incorporate any additional data that becomes available on a T + 1 basis, including the trade reconstruction data;

      (4) Demonstrate the ability to comprehensively and accurately reconstruct daily trading activity for the purpose of detecting instances or threats of manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions; and

      (5) Have rules in place that allow it to intervene to prevent or reduce market disruptions. Once a threatened or actual disruption is detected, the security-based swap execution facility shall take steps to prevent the market disruption or reduce its severity.

      (c)  For physical-delivery security-based swaps, the security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it:

      (1) Monitors a security-based swap's terms and conditions as they relate to the underlying asset market; and

      (2) Monitors the availability of the supply of the asset specified by the delivery requirements of the security-based swap.

      (d)  (1) For cash-settled security-based swaps, the security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it monitors the pricing of the reference price used to determine cash flows or settlement.

      (2) For cash-settled security-based swaps listed on the security-based swap execution facility where the reference price is formulated and computed by the security-based swap execution facility, the security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it monitors the continued appropriateness of its methodology for deriving that price and shall promptly amend any methodologies that result, or are likely to result, in manipulation, price distortions, or market disruptions, or impose new methodologies to resolve the threat of disruptions or distortions.

      (3) For cash-settled security-based swaps listed on the security-based swap execution facility where the reference price relies on a third-party index or instrument, including an index or instrument traded on another venue, the security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it monitors for pricing abnormalities in the index or instrument used to calculate the reference price and shall conduct due diligence to ensure that the reference price is not susceptible to manipulation.

      (e)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it has access to sufficient information to assess whether trading in security-based swaps listed on its market, in the index or instrument used as a reference price, or in the underlying asset for its listed security-based swaps is being used to affect prices on its market. The security-based swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it can obtain position and trading information directly from members that conduct substantial trading on its facility or through an information-sharing agreement with other venues or a third-party regulatory service provider. If the position and trading information is not available directly from its members but is available through information-sharing agreements with other trading venues or a third-party regulatory service provider, the security-based swap execution facility should cooperate in such information-sharing agreements.

      (2) A security-based swap execution facility shall have rules that require its members to keep records of their trading, including records of their activity in the underlying asset, and related derivatives markets, and make such records available, upon request, to the security-based swap execution facility or, if applicable, to its regulatory service provider and the Commission. The security-based swap execution facility may limit the application of this requirement to only those members that conduct substantial trading on its facility.

      (f)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and maintain risk control mechanisms to prevent and reduce the potential risk of market disruptions, including, but not limited to, market restrictions that pause or halt trading under market conditions prescribed by the security-based swap execution facility. Such risk control mechanisms shall be designed to avoid market disruptions without unduly interfering with that market's price discovery function. The security-based swap execution facility may choose from among controls that include: pre-trade limits on order size, price collars or bands around the current price, message throttles, daily price limits, and intraday position limits related to financial risk to the clearing member, or design other types of controls, as well as clear error-trade and order-cancellation policies. Within the specific array of controls that are selected, the security-based swap execution facility shall set the parameters for those controls, so that the specific parameters are reasonably likely to serve the purpose of preventing market disruptions and price distortions.

      (g)  A security-based swap execution facility shall have the ability to comprehensively and accurately reconstruct all trading on its facility. All audit-trail data and reconstructions shall be made available to the Commission in a form, manner, and time that is acceptable to the Commission.

      (h)  A security-based swap execution facility shall comply with the rules in this section through a dedicated regulatory department or by contracting with a regulatory service provider pursuant to § 242.819(e).

      § 242.822   Core Principle 5—Ability to obtain information.

#### § § 242.822

      (2) Provide the information to the Commission on request; and

      (3) Have the capacity to carry out such international information-sharing agreements as the Commission may require.

      (b)  A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules that will allow the security-based swap execution facility to have the ability and authority to obtain sufficient information to allow it to fully perform its operational, risk management, governance, and regulatory functions and any requirements under this section, including the capacity to carry out international information-sharing agreements as the Commission may require.

      (c)  A security-based swap execution facility shall have rules that allow it to collect information on a routine basis, allow for the collection of non-routine data from its members, and allow for its examination of books and records kept by members on its facility.

      (d)  A security-based swap execution facility shall provide information in its possession to the Commission upon request, in a form and manner specified by the Commission.

      (e)  A security-based swap execution facility shall share information with other regulatory organizations, data repositories, and third-party data reporting services as required by the Commission or as otherwise necessary and appropriate to fulfill its regulatory and reporting responsibilities. Appropriate information-sharing agreements can be established with such entities, or the Commission can act in conjunction with the security-based swap execution facility to carry out such information sharing.

      § 242.823   Core Principle 6—Financial integrity of transactions.

#### § § 242.823

      (a)  The security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules and procedures for ensuring the financial integrity of security-based swaps entered on or through the facilities of the security-based swap execution facility, including the clearance and settlement of security-based swaps pursuant to section 3C(a)(1) of the Act.

      (b)  Transactions executed on or through the security-based swap execution facility that are required to be cleared under section 3C(a)(1) of the Act or are voluntarily cleared by the counterparties shall be cleared through a registered clearing agency or a clearing agency that has obtained an exemption from clearing agency registration to provide central counterparty services for security-based swaps.

      (c)  A security-based swap execution facility shall provide for the financial integrity of its transactions:

      (1) By establishing minimum financial standards for its members, which shall, at a minimum, require that each member qualify as an eligible contract participant;

      (2) For transactions cleared by a registered clearing agency:

      (i) By ensuring that the security-based swap execution facility has the capacity to route transactions to the registered clearing agency in a manner acceptable to the clearing agency for purposes of clearing; and

      (ii) By coordinating with each registered clearing agency to which it submits transactions for clearing, in the development of rules and procedures to facilitate prompt and efficient transaction processing.

      (d)  A security-based swap execution facility shall monitor its members to ensure that they continue to qualify as eligible contract participants.

      § 242.824   Core Principle 7—Emergency authority.

#### § § 242.824

      (a) The security-based swap execution facility shall adopt rules to provide for the exercise of emergency authority, in consultation or cooperation with the Commission, as is necessary and appropriate, including the authority to liquidate or transfer open positions in any security-based swap or to suspend or curtail trading in a security-based swap.

      (b) To comply with this core principle, a security-based swap execution facility shall adopt rules that are reasonably designed to:

      (1) Allow the security-based swap execution facility to intervene as necessary to maintain markets with fair and orderly trading and to prevent or address manipulation or disruptive trading practices, whether the need for intervention arises exclusively from the security-based swap execution facility's market or as part of a coordinated, cross-market intervention;

      (2) Have the flexibility and independence to address market emergencies in an effective and timely manner consistent with the nature of the emergency, as long as all such actions taken by the security-based swap execution facility are made in good faith to protect the integrity of the markets;

      (3) Take market actions as may be directed by the Commission, including, in situations where a security-based swap is traded on more than one platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest as directed, or agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff;

      (4) Include procedures and guidelines for decision-making and implementation of emergency intervention that avoid conflicts of interest;

      (5) Include alternate lines of communication and approval procedures to address emergencies associated with real-time events; and

      (6) Allow the security-based swap execution facility, to address perceived market threats, to impose or modify position limits, impose or modify price limits, impose or modify intraday market restrictions, impose special margin requirements, order the liquidation or transfer of open positions in any contract, order the fixing of a settlement price, extend or shorten the expiration date or the trading hours, suspend or curtail trading in any contract, transfer customer contracts and the margin, or alter any contract's settlement terms or conditions, or, if applicable, provide for the carrying out of such actions through its agreements with its third-party provider of clearing or regulatory services.

      (c) A security-based swap execution facility shall promptly notify the Commission of its exercise of emergency authority, explaining its decision-making process, the reasons for using its emergency authority, and how conflicts of interest were minimized, including the extent to which the security-based swap execution facility considered the effect of its emergency action on the underlying markets and on markets that are linked or referenced to the contracts traded on its facility, including similar markets on other trading venues. Information on all regulatory actions carried out pursuant to a security-based swap execution facility's emergency authority shall be included in a timely submission of a certified rule pursuant to § 242.807.

      § 242.825   Core Principle 8—Timely publication of trading information.

      (1)  The Daily Market Data Report of a security-based swap execution facility for a business day shall contain the following information for each tenor of each security-based swap traded on that security-based swap execution facility during that business day:

      (i) The trade count (excluding error trades, correcting trades, and offsetting trades);

      (ii) The total notional amount traded (excluding error trades, correcting trades, and offsetting trades);

      (iii) The total notional amount of block trades, after such time as the Commission adopts a definition of “block trade” in § 242.802 of this chapter (Rule 802);

      (iv) The opening and closing price;

      (v) The price that is used for settlement purposes, if different from the closing price; and

      (vi) The lowest price of a sale or offer, whichever is lower, and the highest price of a sale or bid, whichever is higher, that the security-based swap execution facility reasonably determines accurately reflects market conditions. Bids and offers vacated or withdrawn shall not be used in making this determination. A bid is vacated if followed by a higher bid or price and an offer is vacated if followed by a lower offer or price.

      (2)  A security-based swap execution facility must record the following information with respect to security-based swaps on that reporting market:

#### § § 242.829

      (a)  (1) The security-based swap execution facility shall have adequate financial, operational, and managerial resources to discharge each responsibility of the security-based swap execution facility, as determined by the Commission.

      (2) The financial resources of a security-based swap execution facility shall be considered to be adequate if the value of the financial resources:

      (i) Enables the organization to meet its financial obligations to its members notwithstanding a default by a member creating the largest financial exposure for that organization in extreme but plausible market conditions; and

      (ii) Exceeds the total amount that would enable the security-based swap execution facility to cover the operating costs of the security-based swap execution facility for a one-year period, as calculated on a rolling basis.

      (b)  A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain financial resources on an ongoing basis that are adequate to enable it to comply with the core principles set forth in section 3D of the Act and any applicable Commission rules. Financial resources shall be considered adequate if their value exceeds the total amount that would enable the security-based swap execution facility to cover its projected operating costs necessary for the security-based swap execution facility to comply with section 3D of the Act and applicable Commission rules for a one-year period, as calculated on a rolling basis pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

      (c)  Financial resources available to satisfy the requirements of this section may include:

      (1) The security-based swap execution facility's own capital, meaning its assets minus its liabilities calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States; and

      (2) Any other financial resource deemed acceptable by the Commission.

      (d)  The financial resources allocated by a security-based swap execution facility to meet the ongoing requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall include unencumbered, liquid financial assets ( cash and/or highly liquid securities) equal to at least the greater of three months of projected operating costs, as calculated on a rolling basis, or the projected costs needed to wind down the security-based swap execution facility's operations, in each case as determined under paragraph (e) of this section. If a security-based swap execution facility lacks sufficient unencumbered, liquid financial assets to satisfy its obligations under this section, the security-based swap execution facility may satisfy this requirement by obtaining a committed line of credit or similar facility in an amount at least equal to such deficiency.

      (e)  (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall, each fiscal quarter, make a reasonable calculation of its projected operating costs and wind-down costs in order to determine its applicable obligations under this section. The security-based swap execution facility shall have reasonable discretion in determining the methodologies used to compute such amounts.

      (i)  A security-based swap execution facility's calculation of its projected operating costs shall be deemed reasonable if it includes all expenses necessary for the security-based swap execution facility to comply with the core principles set forth in section 3D of the Act and any applicable Commission rules, and if the calculation is based on the security-based swap execution facility's current level of business and business model, taking into account any projected modification to its business model ( the addition or subtraction of business lines or operations or other changes), and any projected increase or decrease in its level of business over the next 12 months. A security-based swap execution facility may exclude the following expenses (“excludable expenses”) from its projected operating cost calculations:

      (A) Costs attributable solely to sales, marketing, business development, product development, or recruitment and any related travel, entertainment, event, or conference costs;

      (B) Compensation and related taxes and benefits for personnel who are not necessary to ensure that the security-based swap execution facility is able to comply with the core principles set forth in section 3D of the Act and any applicable Commission rules;

      (G) Any non-cash costs, including depreciation and amortization.

      (ii)  A security-based swap execution facility's calculation of its projected operating costs shall be deemed reasonable if an expense is prorated and the security-based swap execution facility:

      (A) Maintains sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which an expense is partially attributable to an excludable expense;

      (B) Identifies any prorated expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section; and

      (C) Sufficiently explains why it prorated any expense. Common allocation methodologies that may be used include actual use, headcount, or square footage. A security-based swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies to support its determination to prorate an expense.

      (iii)  A security-based swap execution facility's calculation of its projected operating costs shall be deemed reasonable if it prorates any shared expense that the security-based swap execution facility pays for, but only to the extent that such shared expense is attributable to an affiliate and for which the security-based swap execution facility is reimbursed. To prorate a shared expense, the security-based swap execution facility shall:

      (A) Maintain sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which the shared expense is attributable to and paid for by the security-based swap execution facility and/or affiliated entity. The security-based swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies, that reasonably shows how expenses are attributable to, and paid for by, the security-based swap execution facility and/or its affiliated entities to support its determination to prorate an expense;

      (B) Identify any shared expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section; and

      (C) Sufficiently explain why it prorated the shared expense.

      (2) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Commission may review the methodologies and require changes as appropriate.

      (f)  No less than each fiscal quarter, a security-based swap execution facility shall compute the current market value of each financial resource used to meet its obligations under this section. Reductions in value to reflect market and credit risk (“haircuts”) shall be applied as appropriate.

      (g)  (1) Each fiscal quarter, or at any time upon Commission request, a security-based swap execution facility shall provide a report to the Commission that includes:

      (i) The amount of financial resources necessary to meet the requirements of this section, computed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, and the market value of each available financial resource, computed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section; and

      (ii) Financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows of the security-based swap execution facility.

      (A) The financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, prepared in English, and denominated in U.S. dollars.

      (B) The financial statements of a security-based swap execution facility that is not domiciled in the United States, and is not otherwise required to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if such financial statements are prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or a comparable international standard as the Commission may otherwise accept in its discretion.

      (2) The calculations required by this paragraph (g) shall be made as of the last business day of the security-based swap execution facility's applicable fiscal quarter.

      (3) With each report required under paragraph (g) of this section, the security-based swap execution facility shall also provide the Commission with sufficient documentation explaining the methodology used to compute its financial requirements under this section. Such documentation shall:

      (i) Allow the Commission to reliably determine, without additional requests for information, that the security-based swap execution facility has made reasonable calculations pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; and

      (ii) Include, at a minimum:

      (A) A total list of all expenses, without any exclusion;

      (B) All expenses and the corresponding amounts, if any, that the security-based swap execution facility excluded or prorated when determining its operating costs, calculated on a rolling basis, required under this section, and the basis for any determination to exclude or prorate any such expenses;

      (C) Documentation demonstrating the existence of any committed line of credit or similar facility relied upon for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section ( copies of agreements establishing or amending a credit facility or similar facility); and

      (D) All costs that a security-based swap execution facility would incur to wind down its operations, the projected amount of time for any such wind-down period, and the basis of its determination for the estimation of its costs and timing.

      (4) The reports and supporting documentation required by this section shall be filed not later than 40 calendar days after the end of the security-based swap execution facility's first three fiscal quarters, and not later than 90 calendar days after the end of the security-based swap execution facility's fourth fiscal quarter, or at such later time as the Commission may permit, in its discretion, upon request by the security-based swap execution facility.

      (5) A security-based swap execution facility shall provide notice to the Commission no later than 48 hours after it knows or reasonably should know that it no longer meets its obligations under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.

      (6) A security-based swap execution facility shall provide the report and documentation required by this section to the Commission electronically using the EDGAR system as an Interactive Data File in accordance with § 232.405 of this chapter.

      (ii) Do not involve fraud, deceit, or conversion.

      (i) Any actions or rule changes which address an emergency; and

      (f)  Each security-based swap execution facility and SBS exchange shall submit to the Commission, within 30 days after each governing board election, a list of the governing board's members, the groups or classes of its members that they represent, and how the composition of the governing board otherwise meets the requirements of this section.

      (i) —(A)  A member of a governing board, disciplinary committee, or oversight panel of a security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange must abstain from such body's deliberations and voting on any matter involving a named party in interest where such member:

      (C)  Each security-based swap execution facility and SBS exchange must establish procedures for determining whether any member of its governing board, disciplinary committees, or oversight committees is subject to a conflicts restriction in any matter involving a named party in interest. Taking into consideration the exigency of the committee action, such determinations should be based upon:

      () Information provided by the member pursuant to paragraph (g)(_1_)(i)(B) of this section; and

      () Any other source of information that is held by and reasonably available to the security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange.

      (ii) —(A)  A member of the governing board, disciplinary committee, or oversight panel of a security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange must abstain from such body's deliberations and voting on any significant action if the member knowingly has a direct and substantial financial interest in the result of the vote based upon either exchange or non-exchange positions that could reasonably be expected to be affected by the action.

      (B)  Prior to the consideration of any significant action, each member of a governing board, disciplinary committee, or oversight panel of a security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange must disclose to the appropriate staff of the security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange the position information referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that is known to them. This requirement does not apply to members who choose to abstain from deliberations and voting on the subject significant action.

      (C)  Each security-based swap execution facility and SBS exchange must establish procedures for determining whether any member of its governing board, disciplinary committees, or oversight committees is subject to a conflicts restriction under this section in any significant action.

      (D)  Taking into consideration the exigency of the significant action, such determinations should be based upon:

      () Information provided by the member with respect to positions pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and

      (iii)  (A) Under the rules required by this section, a governing board, disciplinary committee, or oversight panel of a security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange may permit a member to participate in deliberations prior to a vote on a significant action for which they otherwise would be required to abstain, pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, if such participation would be consistent with the public interest and the member recuses from voting on such action.

      (B) In making a determination as to whether to permit a member to participate in deliberations on a significant action for which they otherwise would be required to abstain, the deliberating body shall consider the following factors:

      () Whether the member's participation in deliberations is necessary for the deliberating body to achieve a quorum in the matter; and

      () Whether the member has unique or special expertise, knowledge, or experience in the matter under consideration.

      (C) Prior to any determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the deliberating body must fully consider the position information which is the basis for the member's direct and substantial financial interest in the result of a vote on a significant action pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (iv)  The governing boards, disciplinary committees, and oversight panels of each security-based swap execution facility and SBS exchange must reflect in their minutes or otherwise document that the conflicts determination procedures required by this section have been followed. Such records also must include:

      (A) The names of all members who attended the meeting in person or who otherwise were present by electronic means;

      (B) The name of any members who voluntarily recused themselves or were required to abstain from deliberations and/or voting on a matter and the reason for the recusal or abstention, if stated; and

      (C) Information on the position information that was reviewed for each member.

      (ii) The pertinent failure to meet qualification requirements or other prerequisites for membership or access and the basis upon which the security-based swap execution facility determined that the person concerned could not be permitted to have membership or access with safety to investors, creditors, other members, or the security-based swap execution facility; or

      § 242.901   Reporting obligations.

#### § § 242.901

      (a)  A security-based swap, including a security-based swap that results from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of another security-based swap, shall be reported as follows:

      (1)  If a security-based swap is executed on a platform and will be submitted to clearing, the platform on which the transaction was executed shall report to a registered security-based swap data repository the counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each direct counterparty, as applicable, and the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section (except that, with respect to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the platform need indicate only if both direct counterparties are registered security-based swap dealers) and paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section.

      (2)  For all security-based swaps other than platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing, the reporting side shall provide the information required by §§ 242.900 through 242.909 to a registered security-based swap data repository. The reporting side shall be determined as follows:

      (i)  For a clearing transaction, the reporting side is the registered clearing agency that is a counterparty to the transaction.

      (ii)  (A) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered security-based swap dealer, the sides shall select the reporting side.

      (B) If only one side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap dealer, that side shall be the reporting side.

      (C) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered major security-based swap participant, the sides shall select the reporting side.

      (D) If one side of the security-based swap includes a registered major security-based swap participant and the other side includes neither a registered security-based swap dealer nor a registered major security-based swap participant, the side including the registered major security-based swap participant shall be the reporting side.

      (E) If neither side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant:

      () If both sides include a U.S. person, the sides shall select the reporting side.

      () If one side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § _2_42.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5), the sides shall select the reporting side.

      () If one side includes only non-U.S. persons that do not fall within § 242.908(b)(5) and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person, the side including a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person shall be the reporting side.

      () If neither side includes a U.S. person and neither side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 2_4_2.908(b)(5) but the security-based swap is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility), the registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) shall report the counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each direct counterparty, as applicable, and the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section (except that, with respect to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) need indicate only if both direct counterparties are registered security-based swap dealers) and paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section.

      (3)  A person who, under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, has a duty to report a security-based swap that has been submitted to clearing at a registered clearing agency shall promptly provide that registered clearing agency with the transaction ID of the submitted security-based swap and the identity of the registered security-based swap data repository to which the transaction will be reported or has been reported.

      (b)  If there is no registered security-based swap data repository that will accept the report required by § 242.901(a), the person required to make such report shall instead provide the required information to the Commission.

      (c)  The reporting side shall report the following information within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section:

      (1) The product ID, if available. If the security-based swap has no product ID, or if the product ID does not include the following information, the reporting side shall report:

      (i) Information that identifies the security-based swap, including the asset class of the security-based swap and the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or reference index;

      (ii) The effective date;

      (iii) The scheduled termination date;

      (iv) The terms of any standardized fixed or floating rate payments, and the frequency of any such payments; and

      (v) If the security-based swap is customized to the extent that the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not provide all of the material information necessary to identify such customized security-based swap or does not contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price, a flag to that effect;

      (2) The date and time, to the second, of execution, expressed using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);

      (3) The price, including the currency in which the price is expressed and the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front payments;

      (4) The notional amount(s) and the currenc(ies) in which the notional amount(s) is expressed;

      (5) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered security-based swap dealer, an indication to that effect;

      (6) Whether the direct counterparties intend that the security-based swap will be submitted to clearing; and

      (7) If applicable, any flags pertaining to the transaction that are specified in the policies and procedures of the registered security-based swap data repository to which the transaction will be reported.

      (d)  In addition to the information required under paragraph (c) of this section, for each security-based swap for which it is the reporting side, the reporting side shall report the following information within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section:

      (1) The counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each counterparty, as applicable;

      (2) As applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side;

      (3) To the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, or otherwise customized or non-standard payment streams, including the frequency and contingencies of any such payments;

      (4) For a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction and that will not be allocated after execution, the title and date of any master agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated by reference into the security-based swap contract;

      (5) To the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or other provisions of this paragraph (d), any additional data elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a person to determine the market value of the transaction;

      (6) If applicable, and to the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the name of the clearing agency to which the security-based swap will be submitted for clearing;

      (7) If the direct counterparties do not intend to submit the security-based swap to clearing, whether they have invoked the exception in Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g));

      (8) To the extent not provided pursuant to the other provisions of this paragraph (d), if the direct counterparties do not submit the security-based swap to clearing, a description of the settlement terms, including whether the security-based swap is cash-settled or physically settled, and the method for determining the settlement value;

      (9) The platform ID, if applicable, or if a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) is required to report the security-based swap by § 2_4_2.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(), the broker ID of that registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility); and

      (10) If the security-based swap arises from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps, the transaction ID of the allocated, terminated, assigned, or novated security-based swap(s), except in the case of a clearing transaction that results from the netting or compression of other clearing transactions.

      (e)  (1)(i)  A life cycle event, and any adjustment due to a life cycle event, that results in a change to information previously reported pursuant to paragraph (c), (d), or (i) of this section shall be reported by the reporting side, except that the reporting side shall not report whether or not a security-based swap has been accepted for clearing.

      (ii)  A registered clearing agency shall report whether or not it has accepted a security-based swap for clearing.

      (2) All reports of life cycle events and adjustments due to life cycle events shall, within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section, be reported to the entity to which the original security-based swap transaction will be reported or has been reported and shall include the transaction ID of the original transaction.

      (f)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall time stamp, to the second, its receipt of any information submitted to it pursuant to paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (i) of this section.

      (g)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties.

      (h)  A person having a duty to report shall electronically transmit the information required under this section in a format required by the registered security-based swap data repository to which it reports.

      (i)  With respect to any pre-enactment security-based swap or transitional security-based swap in a particular asset class, and to the extent that information about such transaction is available, the reporting side shall report all of the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to a registered security-based swap data repository that accepts security-based swaps in that asset class and indicate whether the security-based swap was open as of the date of such report.

      (j)  The reporting timeframe for paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be 24 hours after the time of execution (or acceptance for clearing in the case of a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of § 242.908(a)(1)(ii)), or, if 24 hours after the time of execution or acceptance, as applicable, would fall on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is a business day. The reporting timeframe for paragraph (e) of this section shall be 24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle event or the adjustment due to the life cycle event.

      § 242.902   Public dissemination of transaction reports.

#### § § 242.902

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a registered security-based swap data repository shall publicly disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap, or a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle event, immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap, or upon re-opening following a period when the registered security-based swap data repository was closed. The transaction report shall consist of all the information reported pursuant to § 242.901(c), plus any condition flags contemplated by the registered security-based swap data repository's policies and procedures that are required by § 242.907.

      (b) [Reserved].

      (c)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall not disseminate:

      (1) The identity of any counterparty to a security-based swap;

      (2) With respect to a security-based swap that is not cleared at a registered clearing agency and that is reported to the registered security-based swap data repository, any information disclosing the business transactions and market positions of any person;

      (3) Any information regarding a security-based swap reported pursuant to § 242.901(i);

      (4) Any non-mandatory report;

      (5) Any information regarding a security-based swap that is required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.901 and 242.908(a)(1) but is not required to be publicly disseminated pursuant to § 242.908(a)(2);

      (6) Any information regarding a clearing transaction that arises from the acceptance of a security-based swap for clearing by a registered clearing agency or that results from netting other clearing transactions;

      (7) Any information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap; or

      (8) Any information regarding a security-based swap that has been rejected from clearing or rejected by a prime broker if the original transaction report has not yet been publicly disseminated.

      (d)  No person shall make available to one or more persons (other than a counterparty or a post-trade processor) transaction information relating to a security-based swap before the primary trade information about the security-based swap is sent to a registered security-based swap data repository.

      § 242.903   Coded information.

#### § § 242.903

      (a) If an internationally recognized standards-setting system that imposes fees and usage restrictions on persons that obtain UICs for their own usage that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory and that meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section is recognized by the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or product (or has endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based swap data repository shall employ that UIC (or methodology for assigning transaction IDs). If no such system has been recognized by the Commission, or a recognized system has not assigned a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person, or product (or has not endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based swap data repository shall assign a UIC to that person, unit of person, or product using its own methodology (or endorse a methodology for assigning transaction IDs). If the Commission has recognized such a system that assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a registered security-based swap data repository shall obtain a UIC from or through that system for identifying itself, and each participant that acts as a guarantor of a direct counterparty's performance of any obligation under a security-based swap that is subject to § 242.908(a) shall, if the direct counterparty has not already done so, obtain a UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or through that system, if that system permits third-party registration without a requirement to obtain prior permission of the direct counterparty.

      (b) A registered security-based swap data repository may permit information to be reported pursuant to § 242.901, and may publicly disseminate that information pursuant to § 242.902, using codes in place of certain data elements, provided that the information necessary to interpret such codes is widely available to users of the information on a non-fee basis.

      § 242.904   Operating hours of registered security-based swap data repositories.

#### § § 242.904

      A registered security-based swap data repository shall have systems in place to continuously receive and disseminate information regarding security-based swaps pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, subject to the following exceptions:

      (a) A registered security-based swap data repository may establish normal closing hours during periods when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive. A registered security-based swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice to participants and to the public of its normal closing hours.

      (b) A registered security-based swap data repository may declare, on an  basis, special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours. A registered security-based swap data repository shall, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, avoid scheduling special closing hours during periods when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active; and provide reasonable advance notice of its special closing hours to participants and to the public.

      (c) During normal closing hours, and to the extent reasonably practicable during special closing hours, a registered security-based swap data repository shall have the capability to receive and hold in queue information regarding security-based swaps that has been reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909.

      (d) When a registered security-based swap data repository re-opens following normal closing hours or special closing hours, it shall disseminate transaction reports of security-based swaps held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of § 242.902.

      (e) If a registered security-based swap data repository could not receive and hold in queue transaction information that was required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, it must immediately upon re-opening send a message to all participants that it has resumed normal operations. Thereafter, any participant that had an obligation to report information to the registered security-based swap data repository pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, but could not do so because of the registered security-based swap data repository's inability to receive and hold in queue data, must promptly report the information to the registered security-based swap data repository.

      § 242.905   Correction of errors in security-based swap information.

#### § § 242.905

      (a)  Any counterparty or other person having a duty to report a security-based swap that discovers an error in information previously reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909 shall correct such error in accordance with the following procedures:

      (1) If a person that was not the reporting side for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported with respect to such security-based swap, that person shall promptly notify the person having the duty to report the security-based swap of the error; and

      (2) If the person having the duty to report a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported with respect to a security-based swap, or receives notification from a counterparty of an error, such person shall promptly submit to the entity to which the security-based swap was originally reported an amended report pertaining to the original transaction report. If the person having the duty to report reported the initial transaction to a registered security-based swap data repository, such person shall submit an amended report to the registered security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures contemplated by § 242.907(a)(3).

      (b)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall:

      (1) Upon discovery of an error or receipt of a notice of an error, verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based swap and, following such verification, promptly correct the erroneous information regarding such security-based swap contained in its system; and

      (2) If such erroneous information relates to a security-based swap that the registered security-based swap data repository previously disseminated and falls into any of the categories of information enumerated in § 242.901(c), publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report of the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the counterparties to the security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to a previously disseminated transaction.

      § 242.906   Other duties of participants.

#### § § 242.906

      (a)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall identify any security-based swap reported to it for which the registered security-based swap data repository does not have the counterparty ID and (if applicable) the broker ID, branch ID, execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID of each direct counterparty. Once a day, the registered security-based swap data repository shall send a report to each participant of the registered security-based swap data repository or, if applicable, an execution agent, identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, the security-based swap(s) for which the registered security-based swap data repository lacks counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, branch ID, execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. A participant of a registered security-based swap data repository that receives such a report shall provide the missing information with respect to its side of each security-based swap referenced in the report to the registered security-based swap data repository within 24 hours.

      (b)  Each participant of a registered security-based swap data repository that is not a platform, a registered clearing agency, an externally managed investment vehicle, or a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under § 2_4_2.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)() shall provide to the registered security-based swap data repository information sufficient to identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the participant that also are participants of the registered security-based swap data repository, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs. Any such participant shall promptly notify the registered security-based swap data repository of any changes to that information.

      (c)  Each participant of a registered security-based swap data repository that is a registered security-based swap dealer, registered major security-based swap participant, registered clearing agency, platform, or registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under § 2_4_2.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)() shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that it complies with any obligations to report information to a registered security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent with §§ 242.900 through 242.909. Each such participant shall review and update its policies and procedures at least annually.

      § 242.907   Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap data repositories.

#### § § 242.907

      (a)  With respect to the receipt, reporting, and dissemination of data pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, a registered security-based swap data repository shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures:

      (1) That enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap that must be reported, which shall include, at a minimum, the data elements specified in § 242.901(c) and (d);

      (2) That specify one or more acceptable data formats (each of which must be an open-source structured data format that is widely used by participants), connectivity requirements, and other protocols for submitting information;

      (3) For specifying procedures for reporting life cycle events and corrections to previously submitted information, making corresponding updates or corrections to transaction records, and applying an appropriate flag to the transaction report to indicate that the report is an error correction required to be disseminated by § 242.905(b)(2), or is a life cycle event, or any adjustment due to a life cycle event, required to be disseminated by § 242.902(a);

      (4) For:

      (i) Identifying characteristic(s) of a security-based swap, or circumstances associated with the execution or reporting of the security-based swap, that could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of the registered security-based swap data repository, cause a person without knowledge of these characteristic(s) or circumstance(s), to receive a distorted view of the market;

      (ii) Establishing flags to denote such characteristic(s) or circumstance(s);

      (iii) Directing participants that report security-based swaps to apply such flags, as appropriate, in their reports to the registered security-based swap data repository; and

      (iv) Applying such flags:

      (A) To disseminated reports to help to prevent a distorted view of the market; or

      (B) In the case of a transaction referenced in § 242.902(c), to suppress the report from public dissemination entirely, as appropriate;

      (5) For assigning UICs in a manner consistent with § 242.903; and

      (6) For periodically obtaining from each participant other than a platform, registered clearing agency, externally managed investment vehicle, or registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under § 2_4_2.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)() information that identifies the participant's ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs.

      (b) [Reserved].

      (c)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall make the policies and procedures required by §§ 242.900 through 242.909 publicly available on its Web site.

      (d)  A registered security-based swap data repository shall review, and update as necessary, the policies and procedures required by §§ 242.900 through 242.909 at least annually. Such policies and procedures shall indicate the date on which they were last reviewed.

      (e) A registered security-based swap data repository shall provide to the Commission, upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to it pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909 and the registered security-based swap data repository's policies and procedures thereunder.

      § 242.908   Cross-border matters.

#### § § 242.908

      (a)  (1) A security-based swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if:

      (i) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction;

      (ii) The security-based swap is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States;

      (iii) The security-based swap is executed on a platform having its principal place of business in the United States;

      (iv) The security-based swap is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility); or

      (v) The transaction is connected with a non-U.S. person's security-based swap dealing activity and is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office.

      (2) A security-based swap that is not included within paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination if there is a direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides of the transaction that is a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant.

      (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of §§ 242.900 through 242.909, a person shall not incur any obligation under §§ 242.900 through 242.909 unless it is:

      (1) A U.S. person;

      (2) A registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant;

      (3) A platform;

      (4) A registered clearing agency; or

      (5) A non-U.S. person that, in connection with such person's security-based swap dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or executed the security-based swap using its personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, or using personnel of an agent located in a U.S. branch or office.

      (c) —(1)  Compliance with the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission order described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch.

      (2)  (i) The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction's requirements for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements. The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting of security-based swaps that are subject to § 242.908(a)(2) with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction's requirements for the regulatory reporting of security-based swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements.

      (ii) A party that potentially would comply with requirements under §§ 242.900 through 242.909 pursuant to a substituted compliance order or any foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities supervising such a person's security-based swap activities may file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0-13 of this chapter, requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction the rules of which also would require reporting and public dissemination of those security-based swaps.

      (iii) In making such a substituted compliance determination, the Commission shall take into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the foreign financial regulatory authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public dissemination system for security-based swaps.

#### § § 242.304

    (a)  Unless not required to comply with Regulation ATS pursuant to § 242.301(a), an NMS Stock ATS must comply with §§ 242.300 through 242.304 (except § 242.301(b)(2)(i) through (vii)) to be exempt pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2).

    (1)  (i)  No exemption is available to an NMS Stock ATS pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2) unless the NMS Stock ATS files with the Commission an initial Form ATS-N, in accordance with the conditions of this section, and the initial Form ATS-N is effective pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) or (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.

    (ii)  (A) The Commission may, by order, as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, declare an initial Form ATS-N filed by an NMS Stock ATS ineffective no later than 120 calendar days from the date of filing with the Commission, or, if applicable, the end of the extended review period. The Commission may extend the initial Form ATS-N review period for:

    () An additional 90 calendar days, if the Form ATS-N is unusually lengthy or raises novel or complex issues that require additional time for review, in which case the Commission will notify the NMS Stock ATS in writing within the initial _1_20-calendar day review period and will briefly describe the reason for the determination for which additional time for review is required; or

    () Any extended review period to which a duly authorized representative of the NMS Stock ATS agrees in writing.

    (B) During review by the Commission of the initial Form ATS-N, the NMS Stock ATS shall amend its initial Form ATS-N pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section. To make material changes to its initial Form ATS-N during the Commission review period, the NMS Stock ATS shall withdraw its filed initial Form ATS-N and may refile an initial Form ATS-N pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (iii)  (A) An initial Form ATS-N, as amended, filed by an NMS Stock ATS will become effective, unless declared ineffective, upon the earlier of:

    () The completion of review by the Commission and publication pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; or

    () The expiration of the review period, or, if applicable, the end of the extended review period, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (B) The Commission will, by order, declare an initial Form ATS-N ineffective if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. If the Commission declares an initial Form ATS-N ineffective, the NMS Stock ATS shall be prohibited from operating as an NMS Stock ATS pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2). An initial Form ATS-N declared ineffective does not prevent the NMS Stock ATS from subsequently filing a new Form ATS-N.

    (iv)  (A)  A Legacy NMS Stock ATS shall file with the Commission an initial Form ATS-N, in accordance with the conditions of this section, no earlier than January 7, 2019, and no later than February 8, 2019. An initial Form ATS-N filed by a Legacy NMS Stock ATS shall supersede and replace for purposes of the exemption the previously filed Form ATS of the Legacy NMS Stock ATS. The Legacy NMS Stock ATS may operate, on a provisional basis, pursuant to the filed initial Form ATS-N, and any amendments thereto, during the review of the initial Form ATS-N by the Commission. An initial Form ATS-N filed by a Legacy NMS Stock ATS, as amended, will become effective, unless declared ineffective, upon the earlier of:

    () The completion of review by the Commission and publication pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; or

    () The expiration of the review period, or, if applicable, the end of the extended review period, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B) of this section.

    (B)  The Commission may, by order, as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, declare an initial Form ATS-N filed by a Legacy NMS Stock ATS ineffective no later than 120 calendar days from the date of filing with the Commission, or, if applicable, the end of the extended review period. The Commission may extend the initial Form ATS-N review period for a Legacy NMS Stock ATS for:

    () An additional _1_20 calendar days if the initial Form ATS-N is unusually lengthy or raises novel or complex issues that require additional time for review, in which case the Commission will notify the Legacy NMS Stock ATS in writing within the initial 120-calendar day review period and will briefly describe the reason for the determination for which additional time for review is required; or

    () Any extended review period to which a duly-authorized representative of the Legacy NMS Stock ATS agrees in writing.

    (C)  During review by the Commission of the initial Form ATS-N filed by a Legacy NMS Stock ATS, the Legacy NMS Stock ATS shall amend its initial Form ATS-N pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

    (B) No later than 30 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter to correct information that has become inaccurate or incomplete for any reason and was not required to be reported to the Commission as a Form ATS-N amendment pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A), (C), or (D) of this section (“Updating Amendment”);

    (C) Promptly, to correct information in any previous disclosure on Form ATS-N, after discovery that any information previously filed on Form ATS-N was materially inaccurate or incomplete when filed (“Correcting Amendment”); or

    (D) No later than seven calendar days after information required to be disclosed in Part III, Items 24 and 25 on Form ATS-N has become inaccurate or incomplete (“Order Display and Fair Access Amendment”).

    (ii)  The Commission will, by order, declare ineffective any Form ATS-N amendment filed pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, no later than 30 calendar days from filing with the Commission, if the Commission finds that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. A Form ATS-N amendment declared ineffective shall prohibit the NMS Stock ATS from operating pursuant to the ineffective Form ATS-N amendment. A Form ATS-N amendment declared ineffective does not prevent the NMS Stock ATS from subsequently filing a new Form ATS-N amendment. During review by the Commission of a Material Amendment, the NMS Stock ATS shall amend the Material Amendment pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) through (C) of this section. To make material changes to a filed Material Amendment during the Commission review period, an NMS Stock ATS shall withdraw its filed Material Amendment and must file the new Material Amendment pursuant to (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section.

    (3)  An NMS Stock ATS shall notice its cessation of operations on Form ATS-N at least 10 business days prior to the date the NMS Stock ATS will cease to operate as an NMS Stock ATS. The notice of cessation shall cause the Form ATS-N to become ineffective on the date designated by the NMS Stock ATS.

    (4)  (i) The Commission will, by order, if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors, suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, limit, or revoke the exemption for an NMS Stock ATS pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2) of this chapter.

    (ii) If the exemption for an NMS Stock ATS is suspended or revoked pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the NMS Stock ATS shall be prohibited from operating pursuant to the exemption pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2) of this chapter. If the exemption for an NMS Stock ATS is limited pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the NMS Stock ATS shall be prohibited from operating in a manner otherwise inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Commission order.

    (b)  (1) Every Form ATS-N filed pursuant to this section shall constitute a “report” within the meaning of sections 11A, 17(a), 18(a), and 32(a) (15 U.S.C. 78k-1, 78q(a), 78r(a), and 78ff(a)), and any other applicable provisions of the Act.

    (2) The Commission will make public via posting on the Commission's website, each:

    (ii) Order of ineffective initial Form ATS-N;

    (iii) Form ATS-N amendment to an effective Form ATS-N:

    (A)  The cover page of the Material Amendment will be made public by the Commission upon filing and, unless the Commission declares the Material Amendment ineffective, the entirety of the Material Amendment, as amended, will be made public by the Commission following the expiration of the review period pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

    (B)  The entirety of Updating, Correcting, and Order Display and Fair Access Amendments will be made public by the Commission upon filing.

    § 243.101   Definitions.

#### § § 243.101

    This section defines certain terms as used in Regulation FD (§§ 243.100-243.103).

    (a)  A selective disclosure of material nonpublic information is “intentional” when the person making the disclosure either knows, or is reckless in not knowing, that the information he or she is communicating is both material and nonpublic.

    (b)  An “issuer” subject to this regu_l_ation is one that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78), or is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)), including any closed-end investment company (as defined in Section 5(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) (15 U.S.C. 80a-5(a)(2)), but not including any other investment company or any foreign government or foreign private issuer, as those terms are defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (§ 230.405 of this chapter).

    (c)  “Person acting on behalf of an issuer” means any senior official of the issuer (or, in the case of a closed-end investment company, a senior official of the issuer's investment adviser), or any other officer, employee, or agent of an issuer who regularly communicates with any person described in § 243.100(b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), or with holders of the issuer's securities. An officer, director, employee, or agent of an issuer who discloses material nonpublic information in breach of a duty of trust or confidence to the issuer shall not be considered to be acting on behalf of the issuer.

    (d)  “Promptly” means as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event after the later of 24 hours or the commencement of the next day's trading on the New York Stock Exchange) after a senior official of the issuer (or, in the case of a closed-end investment company, a senior official of the issuer's investment adviser) learns that there has been a non-intentional disclosure by the issuer or person acting on behalf of the issuer of information that the senior official knows, or is reckless in not knowing, is both material and nonpublic.

    (e)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an issuer shall make the “public disclosure” of information required by § 243.100(a) by furnishing to or filing with the Commission a Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) disclosing that information.

    (2) An issuer shall be exempt from the requirement to furnish or file a Form 8-K if it instead disseminates the information through another method (or combination of methods) of disclosure that is reasonably designed to provide broad, non-exclusionary distribution of the information to the public.

    (f)  “Senior official” means any director, executive officer (as defined in § 240.3b-7 of this chapter), investor relations or public relations officer, or other person with similar functions.

    (g)  For purposes of § 243.100(b)(2)(iv):

    (1)  A securities offering that is underwritten commences when the issuer reaches an understanding with the broker-dealer that is to act as managing underwriter and continues until the later of the end of the period during which a dealer must deliver a prospectus or the sale of the securities (unless the offering is sooner terminated);

    (2)  A securities offering that is not underwritten:

    (i) If covered by Rule 415(a)(1)(x) (§ 230.415(a)(1)(x) of this chapter), commences when the issuer makes its first bona fide offer in a takedown of securities and continues until the later of the end of the period during which each dealer must deliver a prospectus or the sale of the securities in that takedown (unless the takedown is sooner terminated);

    (ii) If a business combination as defined in Rule 165(f)(1) (§ 230.165(f)(1) of this chapter), commences when the first public announcement of the transaction is made and continues until the completion of the vote or the expiration of the tender offer, as applicable (unless the transaction is sooner terminated);

    (iii) If an offering other than those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, commences when the issuer files a registration statement and continues until the later of the end of the period during which each dealer must deliver a prospectus or the sale of the securities (unless the offering is sooner terminated).

    § 243.102   No effect on antifraud liability.

#### § § 243.102

    No failure to make a public disclosure required solely by § 243.100 shall be deemed to be a violation of Rule 10b-5 (17 CFR 240.10b-5) under the Securities Exchange Act.

    § 243.103   No effect on Exchange Act reporting status.

#### § § 243.103

    A failure to make a public disclosure required solely by § 243.100 shall not affect whether:

    (a) For purposes of Forms S-3 (17 CFR 239.13), S-8 (17 CFR 239.16b) and SF-3 (17 CFR 239.45) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a ), or Form N-2 (17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a ) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 ), an issuer is deemed to have filed all the material required to be filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) or where applicable, has made those filings in a timely manner; or

    (b) There is adequate current public information about the issuer for purposes of § 230.144(c) of this chapter (Rule 144(c)).

    § 245.101   Prohibition of insider trading during pension fund blackout periods.

#### § § 245.101

    (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, it is unlawful under section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)(1)) for any director or executive officer of an issuer of any equity security (other than an exempt security), directly or indirectly, to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any equity security of the issuer (other than an exempt security) during any blackout period with respect to such equity security, if such director or executive officer acquires or previously acquired such equity security in connection with his or her service or employment as a director or executive officer.

    (b) For purposes of section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, any sale or other transfer of an equity security of the issuer during a blackout period will be treated as a transaction involving an equity security “acquired in connection with service or employment as a director or executive officer” (as defined in § 245.100(a)) to the extent that the director or executive officer has a pecuniary interest (as defined in § 245.100(l)) in such equity security, unless the director or executive officer establishes by specific identification of securities that the transaction did not involve an equity security “acquired in connection with service or employment as a director or executive officer.” To establish that the equity security was not so acquired, a director or executive officer must identify the source of the equity securities and demonstrate that he or she has utilized the same specific identification for any purpose related to the transaction (such as tax reporting and any applicable disclosure and reporting requirements).

    (c) The following transactions are exempt from section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:

    (2) Any purchase or sale of equity securities of the issuer pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan entered into by the director or executive officer that satisfies the affirmative defense conditions of § 240.10b5-1(c) of this chapter; provided that the director or executive officer did not enter into or modify the contract, instruction or written plan during the blackout period (as defined in § 245.100(b)) in question, or while aware of the actual or approximate beginning or ending dates of that blackout period (whether or not the director or executive officer received notice of the blackout period as required by Section 306(a)(6) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)(6)));

    (3) Any purchase or sale of equity securities, other than a Discretionary Transaction (as defined in § 240.16b-3(b)(1) of this chapter), pursuant to a Qualified Plan (as defined in § 240.16b-3(b)(4) of this chapter), an Excess Benefit Plan (as defined in § 240.16b-3(b)(2) of this chapter) or a Stock Purchase Plan (as defined in § 240.16b-3(b)(5) of this chapter) (or, in the case of a foreign private issuer, pursuant to an employee benefit plan that either (i) has been approved by the taxing authority of a foreign jurisdiction, or (ii) is eligible for preferential treatment under the tax laws of a foreign jurisdiction because the plan provides for broad-based employee participation); provided that a Discretionary Transaction that meets the conditions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section also shall be exempt;

    (4) Any grant or award of an option, stock appreciation right or other equity compensation pursuant to a plan that, by its terms:

    (i) Permits directors or executive officers to receive grants or awards; and

    (ii) Either:

    (A) States the amount and price of securities to be awarded to designated directors and executive officers or categories of directors and executive officers (though not necessarily to others who may participate in the plan) and specifies the timing of awards to directors and executive officers; or

    (B) Sets forth a formula that determines the amount, price and timing, using objective criteria (such as earnings of the issuer, value of the securities, years of service, job classification, and compensation levels);

    (5) Any exercise, conversion or termination of a derivative security that the director or executive officer did not write or acquire during the blackout period (as defined in § 245.100(b)) in question, or while aware of the actual or approximate beginning or ending dates of that blackout period (whether or not the director or executive officer received notice of the blackout period as required by Section 306(a)(6) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002); and either:

    (i) The derivative security, by its terms, may be exercised, converted or terminated only on a fixed date, with no discretionary provision for earlier exercise, conversion or termination; or

    (ii) The derivative security is exercised, converted or terminated by a counterparty and the director or executive officer does not exercise any influence on the counterparty with respect to whether or when to exercise, convert or terminate the derivative security;

    (6) Any acquisition or disposition of equity securities involving a bona fide gift or a transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution;

    (7) Any acquisition or disposition of equity securities pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or the rules thereunder;

    (8) Any sale or other disposition of equity securities compelled by the laws or other requirements of an applicable jurisdiction;

    (9) Any acquisition or disposition of equity securities in connection with a merger, acquisition, divestiture or similar transaction occurring by operation of law;

    (11) Any acquisition or disposition of an asset-backed security, as defined in § 229.1101 of this chapter.

    § 245.102   Exceptions to definition of blackout period.

    (a) A regularly scheduled period in which participants and beneficiaries may not purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in any equity security of an issuer, if a description of such period, including its frequency and duration and the plan transactions to be suspended or otherwise affected, is:

    (1) Incorporated into the individual account plan or included in the documents or instruments under which the plan operates; and

    (2) Disclosed to an employee before he or she formally enrolls, or within 30 days following formal enrollment, as a participant under the individual account plan or within 30 days after the adoption of an amendment to the plan. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), the disclosure may be provided in any graphic form that is reasonably accessible to the employee; or

    (b) Any trading suspension described in § 245.100(b) that is imposed in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, divestiture or similar transaction involving the plan or plan sponsor, the principal purpose of which is to permit persons affiliated with the acquired or divested entity to become participants or beneficiaries, or to cease to be participants or beneficiaries, in an individual account plan; provided that the persons who become participants or beneficiaries in an individual account plan are not able to participate in the same class of equity securities after the merger, acquisition, divestiture or similar transaction as before the transaction.

    § 245.103   Issuer right of recovery; right of action by equity security owner.

#### § § 245.103

    (a)  Section 306(a)(2) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)(2)) provides that any profit realized by a director or executive officer from any purchase, sale or other acquisition or transfer of any equity security of an issuer in violation of section 306(a)(1) of that Act (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)(1)) will inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, regardless of any intention on the part of the director or executive officer in entering into the transaction.

    (b)  Section 306(a)(2) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 provides that an action to recover profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any equity security of the issuer in the name and on behalf of the issuer if the issuer fails or refuses to bring such action within 60 days after the date of request, or fails diligently to prosecute the action thereafter, except that no such suit may be brought more than two years after the date on which such profit was realized.

    (c)  (1) In determining the profit recoverab_l_e in an action undertaken pursuant to section 306(a)(2) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 from a transaction that involves a purchase, sale or other acquisition or transfer (other than a grant, exercise, conversion or termination of a derivative security) in violation of section 306(a)(1) of that Act of an equity security of an issuer that is registered pursuant to section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78(b) or (g)) and listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association, profit (including any loss avoided) may be measured by comparing the difference between the amount paid or received for the equity security on the date of the transaction during the blackout period and the average market price of the equity security calculated over the first three trading days after the ending date of the blackout period.

    (2) In determining the profit recoverable in an action undertaken pursuant to section 306(a)(2) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 from a transaction that is not described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, profit (including any loss avoided) may be measured in a manner that is consistent with the objective of identifying the amount of any gain realized or loss avoided by a director or executive officer as a result of a transaction taking place in violation of section 306(a)(1) of that Act during the blackout period as opposed to taking place outside of such blackout period.

    (3) The terms of this section do not limit in any respect the authority of the Commission to seek or determine remedies as the result of a transaction taking place in violation of section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

    § 245.104   Notice.

#### § § 245.104

    (a) In any case in which a director or executive officer is subject to section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)(1)) in connection with a blackout period (as defined in § 245.100(b)) with respect to any equity security, the issuer of the equity security must timely notify each director or officer and the Commission of the blackout period.

    (b) For purposes of this section:

    (1) The notice must include:

    (i) The reason or reasons for the blackout period;

    (C) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv), a  means a seven-day period beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday; and

    (v) The name, address and telephone number of the person designated by the issuer to respond to inquiries about the blackout period, or, in the absence of such a designation, the issuer's human resources director or person performing equivalent functions.

    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the requirement to give advance notice will not apply in any case in which the inability to provide advance notice of the blackout period is due to events that were unforeseeable to, or circumstances that were beyond the reasonable control of, the issuer, and the issuer reasonably so determines in writing. Determinations described in the preceding sentence must be dated and signed by an authorized representative of the issuer. In any case in which this exception to the advance notice requirement applies, the issuer must provide the notice described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as well as a copy of the written determination, to all affected directors and executive officers as soon as reasonably practicable.

    (iii) If there is a subsequent change in the beginning or ending dates of the blackout period as provided in the notice to the Commission under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an issuer must file a current report on Form 8-K containing the updated beginning or ending dates of the blackout period, explaining the reasons for the change in the date or dates and identifying all material changes in the information contained in the prior report.

      (a)  Except as provided in §§ 246.5 through 246.10, the sponsor of a securitization transaction must retain an eligible vertical interest or eligible horizontal residual interest, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      (1) If the sponsor retains only an eligible vertical interest as its required risk retention, the sponsor must retain an eligible vertical interest in a percentage of not less than 5 percent.

      (2) If the sponsor retains only an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the amount of the interest must equal at least 5 percent of the fair value of all ABS interests in the issuing entity issued as a part of the securitization transaction, determined using a fair value measurement framework under GAAP.

      (3) If the sponsor retains both an eligible vertical interest and an eligible horizontal residual interest as its required risk retention, the percentage of the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest and the percentage of the eligible vertical interest must equal at least five.

      (4) The percentage of the eligible vertical interest, eligible horizontal residual interest, or combination thereof retained by the sponsor must be determined as of the closing date of the securitization transaction.

      (b)  In lieu of retaining all or any part of an eligible horizontal residual interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor may, at closing of the securitization transaction, cause to be established and funded, in cash, an eligible horizontal cash reserve account in the amount equal to the fair value of such eligible horizontal residual interest or part thereof, provided that the account meets all of the following conditions:

      (1) The account is held by the trustee (or person performing similar functions) in the name and for the benefit of the issuing entity;

      (2) Amounts in the account are invested only in cash and cash equivalents; and

      (3) Until all ABS interests in the issuing entity are paid in full, or the issuing entity is dissolved:

      (i) Amounts in the account shall be released only to:

      (A) Satisfy payments on ABS interests in the issuing entity on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to satisfy an amount due on any ABS interest; or

      (B) Pay critical expenses of the trust unrelated to credit risk on any payment date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds from any source to pay such expenses and:

      () Such expenses, in the absence of available funds in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account, would be paid prior to any payments to holders of ABS interests; and

      () Such payments are made to parties that are not affiliated with the sponsor; and

      (ii) Interest (or other earnings) on investments made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be released once received by the account.

      (c)  A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption “Credit Risk Retention”, a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities in the securitization transaction the following disclosures in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (c):

      (1)  With respect to any eligible horizontal residual interest held under paragraph (a) of this section, a sponsor must disclose:

      (i) A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security issued in the same offering of ABS interests,

      (A) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction. If the specific prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization are not available, the sponsor must disclose a range of fair values (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the close of the securitization transaction based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes, or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization. A sponsor disclosing a range of fair values based on a range of bona fide estimates or specified prices, sizes or rates of interest of each tranche of the securitization must also disclose the method by which it determined any range of prices, tranche sizes, or rates of interest.

      (B) A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor;

      (C) A description of the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair values or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including any portion of the eligible horizontal residual interest retained by the sponsor;

      (D) All key inputs and assumptions or a comprehensive description of such key inputs and assumptions that were used in measuring the estimated total fair value or range of fair values of all classes of ABS interests, including the eligible horizontal residual interest to be retained by the sponsor.

      (E) To the extent applicable to the valuation methodology used, the disclosure required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section shall include, but should not be limited to, quantitative information about each of the following:

      () Discount rates;

      () Loss given default (recovery);

      () Prepayment rates;

      () Default rates;

      (F) The disclosure required in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall include, at a minimum, descriptions of all inputs and assumptions that either could have a material impact on the fair value calculation or would be material to a prospective investor's ability to evaluate the sponsor's fair value calculations. To the extent the disclosure required in this paragraph (c)(1) includes a description of a curve or curves, the description shall include a description of the methodology that was used to derive each curve and a description of any aspects or features of each curve that could materially impact the fair value calculation or the ability of a prospective investor to evaluate the sponsor's fair value calculation. To the extent a sponsor uses information about the securitized assets in its calculation of fair value, such information shall not be as of a date more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided that for a subsequent issuance of ABS interests by the same issuing entity with the same sponsor for which the securitization transaction distributes amounts to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, such information shall not be as of a date more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors; provided further, that the balance or value (in accordance with the transaction documents) of the securitized assets may be increased or decreased to reflect anticipated additions or removals of assets the sponsor makes or expects to make between the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the asset pool collateralizing such asset-backed security and the closing date of the securitization.

      (G) A summary description of the reference data set or other historical information used to develop the key inputs and assumptions referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section, including loss given default and default rates;

      (ii) A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction:

      (A) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest the sponsor retained at the closing of the securitization transaction, based on actual sale prices and finalized tranche sizes;

      (B) The fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to retain under this section; and

      (C) To the extent the valuation methodology or any of the key inputs and assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value or range of fair values disclosed prior to sale and required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section materially differs from the methodology or key inputs and assumptions used to calculate the fair value at the time of closing, descriptions of those material differences.

      (iii) If the sponsor retains risk through the funding of an eligible horizontal cash reserve account:

      (A) The amount to be placed (or that is placed) by the sponsor in the eligible horizontal cash reserve account at closing, and the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) of the eligible horizontal residual interest that the sponsor is required to fund through the eligible horizontal cash reserve account in order for such account, together with other retained interests, to satisfy the sponsor's risk retention requirement;

      (B) A description of the material terms of the eligible horizontal cash reserve account; and

      (C) The disclosures required in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (B) The percentage that the sponsor is required to retain as a vertical interest under this section; and

      (C) A description of the material terms of the vertical interest and the amount that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction.

      (ii) A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of the vertical interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

      (d)  A sponsor must retain the certifications and disclosures required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.

      § 246.5   Revolving pool securitizations.

#### § § 246.5

      (a)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

      means an issuing entity that is established to issue on multiple issuance dates more than one series, class, subclass, or tranche of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of securitized assets that will change in composition over time, and that does not monetize excess interest and fees from its securitized assets.

      means an ABS interest or ABS interests:

      (1) Collateralized by the securitized assets and servicing assets owned or held by the issuing entity, other than the following that are not considered a component of seller's interest:

      (i) Servicing assets that have been allocated as collateral only for a specific series in connection with administering the revolving pool securitization, such as a principal accumulation or interest reserve account; and

      (ii) Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and

      (2) That is  with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and

      (3) That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.

      (b)  A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 246.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.

      (c)  In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:

      (1) The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:

      (i) The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and

      (ii) Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 246.4 are permitted to be invested;

      (3) If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;

      (4) The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and

      (i) At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or

      (ii) If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).

      (d)  In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding § 246.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.

      (2) If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.

      (3) If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.

      (f)  The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:

      (1) Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;

      (2) Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 246.4 are permitted to be invested; and

      (3) In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.

      (g)  The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this § 246.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding § 246.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).

      (h)  The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);

      (1) Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;

      (2) The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;

      (3) The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and

      (4) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:

      (i) The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and

      (ii) The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.

      (i)  The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in § 246.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:

      (1) The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;

      (2) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:

      (i) As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and

      (ii) Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:

      (A) The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;

      (B) the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,

      (C) the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.

      (j)  A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this § 246.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:

      (1) The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and

      (2) The dates are no more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors of disclosures required for the interest by paragraph (k) of this section, or for revolving pool securitizations that make distributions to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, no more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors of such disclosures.

      (k)  (1)  A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption “Credit Risk Retention” the following disclosure in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (k):

      (i) A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security, a description of the material terms of the seller's interest, and the percentage of the seller's interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction, measured in accordance with the requirements of this § 246.5, as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests issued, or as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, as required by the terms of the securitization transaction;

      (ii) A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of seller's interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) A description of the material terms of any horizontal residual interests offsetting the seller's interest in accordance with paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section; and

      (iv) Disclosure of the fair value of those horizontal residual interests retained by the sponsor for the series being offered to investors and described in the disclosures, as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests issued, described in the same manner and within the same timeframes required for disclosure of the fair values of eligible horizontal residual interests specified in § 246.4(c).

      (2)  Disclosures required by this paragraph (k) to be made a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security of the amount of seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest may include adjustments to the amount of securitized assets for additions or removals the sponsor expects to make before the closing date and adjustments to the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for expected increases and decreases of those interests under the control of the sponsor.

      (3)  A sponsor must retain the disclosures required in paragraph (k)(1) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.

      (l)  A sponsor that organizes a revolving pool securitization that relies on this § 246.5 to satisfy the risk retention requirements of § 246.3, does not violate the requirements of this part if its seller's interest falls below the level required by § 246. 5 after the revolving pool securitization commences early amortization, pursuant to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, of all series of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:

      (1) The sponsor was in full compliance with the requirements of this section on all measurement dates specified in paragraph (c) of this section prior to the commencement of early amortization;

      (2) The terms of the seller's interest continue to make it  with or subordinate in identical or varying amounts to each series of outstanding investor ABS interests issued with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets;

      (3) The terms of any horizontal interest relied upon by the sponsor pursuant to paragraph (g) to offset the minimum seller's interest amount continue to require the interests to absorb losses in accordance with the terms of paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable; and

      (4) The revolving pool securitization issues no additional ABS interests after early amortization is initiated to any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, either at the time of issuance or during the amortization period.

      (C)  A subsequent third-party purchaser is subject to all of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) through (5), and (b)(8) of this section applicable to third-party purchasers, provided that obligations under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) through (5), and (b)(8) of this section that apply to initial third-party purchasers at or before the time of closing of the securitization transaction shall apply to successor third-party purchasers at or before the time of the transfer of the eligible horizontal residual interest to the successor third-party purchaser.

      Privacy and Opt Out Notices

        § 248.4   Initial privacy notice to consumers required.

#### § § 248.4

        (a)  You must provide a clear and conspicuous notice that accurately reflects your privacy policies and practices to:

        (1)  An individual who becomes your customer, not later than when you establish a customer relationship, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (2)  A consumer, before you disclose any nonpublic personal information about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, if you make such a disclosure other than as authorized by §§ 248.14 and 248.15.

        (b)  You are not required to provide an initial notice to a consumer under paragraph (a) of this section if:

        (1) You do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, other than as authorized by §§ 248.14 and 248.15; and

        (2) You do not have a customer relationship with the consumer.

        (c) —(1)  You establish a customer relationship when you and the consumer enter into a continuing relationship.

        (2)  You do not have a customer relationship with a consumer if you buy a loan made to the consumer but do not have the servicing rights for that loan.

        (3)  You establish a customer relationship when the consumer:

        (i) Effects a securities transaction with you or opens a brokerage account with you under your procedures;

        (ii) Opens a brokerage account with an introducing broker or dealer that clears transactions with and for its customers through you on a fully disclosed basis;

        (iii) Enters into an advisory contract with you (whether in writing or orally); or

        (iv) Purchases shares you have issued (and the consumer is the record owner of the shares), if you are an investment company.

        (d)  When an existing customer obtains a new financial product or service from you that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you satisfy the initial notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as follows:

        (1) You may provide a revised privacy notice, under § 248.8, that covers the customer's new financial product or service; or

        (2) If the initial, revised, or annual notice that you most recently provided to that customer was accurate with respect to the new financial product or service, you do not need to provide a new privacy notice under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (i) Establishing the customer relationship is not at the customer's election;

        (ii) Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would substantially delay the customer's transaction and the customer agrees to receive the notice at a later time; or

        (iii) A nonaffiliated broker or dealer or investment adviser establishes a customer relationship between you and a consumer without your prior knowledge.

        (2) —(i)  Establishing a customer relationship is not at the customer's election if the customer's account is transferred to you by a trustee selected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) and appointed by a United States Court.

        (iii)  Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would not substantially delay the customer's transaction when the relationship is initiated in person at your office or through other means by which the customer may view the notice, such as on a web site.

        (f)  When you are required to deliver an initial privacy notice by this section, you must deliver it according to § 248.9. If you use a short-form initial notice for non-customers according to § 248.6(d), you may deliver your privacy notice according to § 248.6(d)(3).

        (i)  If you no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because you change your policies or practices in such a way that § 248.8 requires you to provide a revised privacy notice, you must provide an annual privacy notice in accordance with the timing requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, treating the revised privacy notice as an initial privacy notice.

        (ii)  If you no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because you change your policies or practices in such a way that § 248.8 does not require you to provide a revised privacy notice, you must provide an annual privacy notice within 100 days of the change in your policies or practices that causes you to no longer meet the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

If you were not required to provide a revised privacy notice under § 248.8, you must provide an annual privacy notice by July 9 of year 1.

        (B) You change your policies and practices in such a way that you no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and so provide an annual notice to your customers. After providing the annual notice to your customers, you once again meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section for an exception to the annual notice requirement. You do not need to provide additional annual notice to your customers until such time as you no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (D) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out.

        (iii)  You  provide a reasonable means of opting out if:

        (A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or

        (B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.

        (iv)  You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for that consumer.

        (b)  You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form as the initial notice you provide in accordance with § 248.4.

        (c)  If you provide the opt out notice after the initial notice in accordance with § 248.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

        (d)  (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer.

        (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either:

        (i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or

        (ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.

        (i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary;

        (ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction; or

        (iii) Permit John and Mary to make different opt out directions. If you do so:

        (A) You must permit John and Mary to opt out for each other.

        (B) If both opt out, you must permit both to notify you in a single response (such as on a form or through a telephone call).

        (C) If John opts out and Mary does not, you may only disclose nonpublic personal information about Mary, but not about John and not about John and Mary jointly.

        (e)  You must comply with a consumer's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it.

        (f)  A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.

        (g)  (1) A consumer's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

        (2) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship.

        (h)  When you are required to deliver an opt out notice by this section, you must deliver it according to § 248.9.

        (i)  Pursuant to § 248.2(a) and appendix A to subpart A of this part, Form S-P meets the notice content requirements of this section.

        (4) —(i)  Unless a covered institution has determined, after a reasonable investigation of the facts and circumstances of the incident of unauthorized access to or use of sensitive customer information that occurred at the covered institution or one of its service providers that is not itself a covered institution, that sensitive customer information has not been, and is not reasonably likely to be, used in a manner that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience, the covered institution must provide a clear and conspicuous notice, or ensure that such notice is provided, to each affected individual whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization. The notice must be transmitted by a means designed to ensure that each affected individual can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice in writing.

        (ii)  If an incident of unauthorized access to or use of customer information has occurred or is reasonably likely to have occurred, but the covered institution is unable to identify which specific individuals' sensitive customer information has been accessed or used without authorization, the covered institution must provide notice to all individuals whose sensitive customer information resides in the customer information system that was, or was reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization.

        (iii)  A covered institution must provide the notice as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days, after becoming aware that unauthorized access to or use of customer information has occurred or is reasonably likely to have occurred unless the United States Attorney General determines that the notice required under this rule poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety, and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing, in which case the covered institution may delay providing such notice for a time period specified by the Attorney General, up to 30 days following the date when such notice was otherwise required to be provided. The notice may be delayed for an additional period of up to 30 days if the Attorney General determines that the notice continues to pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing. In extraordinary circumstances, notice required under this section may be delayed for a final additional period of up to 60 days if the Attorney General determines that such notice continues to pose a substantial risk to national security and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing. Beyond the final 60-day delay under this paragraph (a)(4)(iii), if the Attorney General indicates that further delay is necessary, the Commission will consider additional requests for delay and may grant such delay through Commission exemptive order or other action.

        (iv)  The notice must:

        (5)  (i) A covered institution's response program prepared in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section must include the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require oversight, including through due diligence and monitoring, of service providers, including to ensure that the covered institution notifies affected individuals as set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (A) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and

        (B) Provide notification to the covered institution as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after becoming aware that a breach in security has occurred resulting in unauthorized access to a customer information system maintained by the service provider.

      (A) A list of names and addresses of customers of an entity that is not a financial institution; or

      (B) Information that does not identify a consumer, such as aggregate information or blind data that does not contain personal identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.

      (v)(1)  means any information that you reasonably believe is lawfully made available to the general public from:

      (i) Federal, State, or local government records;

      (ii) Widely distributed media; or

      (iii) Disclosures to the general public that are required to be made by federal, State, or local law.

      (2) —(i)  (A) You have a reasonable belief that information about your consumer is made available to the general public if you have confirmed, or your consumer has represented to you, that the information is publicly available from a source described in paragraphs (v)(1)(i)-(iii) of this section;

      (B) You have a reasonable belief that information about your consumer is made available to the general public if you have taken steps to submit the information, in accordance with your internal procedures and policies and with applicable law, to a keeper of federal, State, or local government records that is required by law to make the information publicly available.

      (C) You have a reasonable belief that an individual's telephone number is lawfully made available to the general public if you have located the telephone number in the telephone book or the consumer has informed you that the telephone number is not unlisted.

      (D) You do not have a reasonable belief that information about a consumer is publicly available solely because that information would normally be recorded with a keeper of federal, State, or local government records that is required by law to make the information publicly available, if the consumer has the ability in accordance with applicable law to keep that information nonpublic, such as where a consumer may record a deed in the name of a blind trust.

**Source:** Source: 74 FR 40431, Aug. 11, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

      § 248.101   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 248.101

      (a)  The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 624 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681,  (“FCRA”). Section 624, which was added to the FCRA by section 214 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952 (2003) (“FACT Act” or “Act”), regulates the use of consumer information received from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations.

      (b)  This subpart applies to any broker or dealer other than a notice-registered broker or dealer, to any investment company, and to any investment adviser or transfer agent registered with the Commission. These entities are referred to in this subpart as “you.”

      § 248.102   Examples.

#### § § 248.102

      The examples in this subpart are not exclusive. The examples in this subpart provide guidance concerning the rules' application in ordinary circumstances. The facts and circumstances of each individual situation, however, will determine whether compliance with an example, to the extent applicable, constitutes compliance with this subpart. Examples in a paragraph illustrate only the issue described in the paragraph and do not illustrate any other issue that may arise under this subpart. Similarly, the examples do not illustrate any issues that may arise under other laws or regulations.

      §§ 248.103-248.119   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 248.103-248.119

      § 248.120   Definitions.

#### § § 248.120

      As used in this subpart, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (a)  of a broker, dealer, or investment company, or an investment adviser or transfer agent registered with the Commission means any person that is related by common ownership or common control with the broker, dealer, or investment company, or the investment adviser or transfer agent registered with the Commission. In addition, a broker, dealer, or investment company, or an investment adviser or transfer agent registered with the Commission will be deemed an affiliate of a company for purposes of this subpart if:

      (1) That company is regulated under section 214 of the FACT Act, Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952 (2003), by a government regulator other than the Commission; and

      (2) Rules adopted by the other government regulator under section 214 of the FACT Act treat the broker, dealer, or investment company, or investment adviser or transfer agent registered with the Commission as an affiliate of that company.

      (b)  has the same meaning as in section 3(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)). A “broker” does not include a broker registered by notice with the Commission under section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(11)).

      (c)  means reasonably understandable and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information presented.

      (d)  means the Securities and Exchange _Commission_.

      (e)  means any corporation, limited liability company, business trust, general or limited partnership, association, or similar organization.

      (f) —(1)  The term “concise” means a reasonably brief expression or statement.

      (2)  A notice required by this subpart may be concise even if it is combined with other disclosures required or authorized by Federal or State law.

      (g)  means an individual.

      (h)  of a company means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise. Any person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25 percent of the voting securities of any company is presumed to control the company. Any person who does not own more than 25 percent of the voting securities of any company will be presumed not to control the company. Any presumption regarding control may be rebutted by evidence, but, in the case of an investment company, will continue until the Commission makes a decision to the contrary according to the procedures described in section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(9)).

      (i)  has the same meaning as in section 3(a)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5)). A “dealer” does not include a dealer registered by notice with the Commission under section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(11)).

      (j)  means any information the communication of which would be a consumer report if the exclusions from the definition of “consumer report” in section 603(d)(2)(A) of the FCRA did not apply. _Eligibility information_ does not include aggregate or blind data that does not contain personal identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.

      (k)  means the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681, ).

      (l)  means the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801, ).

      (m)  has the same meaning as in section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)).

      (n)  has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3) and includes a separate series of the investment company.

      (o) —(1)  The term “marketing solicitation” means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is:

      (i) Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by its affiliate as described in this subpart; and

      (ii) Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such product or service.

      (2)  A marketing solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general public. For example, television, general circulation magazine, billboard advertisements and publicly available Web sites that are not directed to particular consumers would not constitute marketing solicitations, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from the person initiating the communications.

      (3)  A marketing solicitation would include, for example, a telemarketing call, direct mail, e-mail, or other form of marketing communication directed to a particular consumer that is based on eligibility information received from an affiliate.

      (p)  means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.

      (q) —(1)  The term “pre-existing business relationship” means a relationship between a person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on:

      (i) A financial contract between the person and the consumer which is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart;

      (ii) The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of the person's goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or a policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart; or

      (iii) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart.

      (2)  (i) If a consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer that is currently in force, the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.

      (ii) If a consumer has an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser, the investment adviser has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.

      (iii) If a consumer was the record owner of securities issued by an investment company, but the consumer redeems these securities, the investment company has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date the consumer redeemed the investment company's securities.

      (iv) If a consumer applies for a margin account offered by a broker-dealer, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the broker-dealer, the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the application.

      (v) If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a broker-dealer about its products or services and provides contact information to the broker-dealer, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.

      (vi) If a consumer makes an inquiry by e-mail to a broker-dealer about one of its affiliated investment company's products or services but does not obtain a product or service from, or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the broker-dealer or the investment company, the broker-dealer and the investment company both have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information they receive from their affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about their products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.

      (vii) If a consumer who has a pre-existing business relationship with an investment company that is part of a group of affiliated companies makes a telephone call to the centralized call center for the affiliated companies to inquire about products or services offered by a broker-dealer affiliated with the investment company, and provides contact information to the call center, the call constitutes an inquiry to the broker-dealer. In these circumstances, the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from the investment company to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.

      (3)  (i) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the consumer's existing account at a broker-dealer, the call does not constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the broker-dealer that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of the account-holding broker-dealer.

      (ii) If a consumer who has an advisory contract with a registered investment adviser makes a telephone call to an affiliate of the investment adviser to ask about the affiliate's retail locations and hours, but does not make an inquiry about the affiliate's products or services, the call does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate. Also, the affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.

      (iii) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a broker-dealer in response to an advertisement offering a free promotional item to consumers who call a toll-free number, but the advertisement does not indicate that the broker-dealer's products or services will be marketed to consumers who call in response, the call does not create a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the broker-dealer because the consumer has not made an inquiry about a product or service offered by the institution, but has merely responded to an offer for a free promotional item.

      (r)  has the same meaning as in section 3(a)(25) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(25)).

      (s)  means:

      (1) Any broker or dealer other than a broker or dealer registered by notice with the Commission under section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(11));

      (2) Any investment company;

      (3) Any investment adviser registered with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1, ); and

      (4) Any transfer agent registered with the Commission under section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q-1).

      § 248.121   Affiliate marketing opt out and exceptions.

#### § § 248.121

      (a) —(1)  You may not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer, unless:

      (i) It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice that you may use eligibility information about that consumer received from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;

      (ii) The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to “opt out,” or the consumer prohibits you from using eligibility information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer; and

      (iii) The consumer has not opted out.

      (2)  A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated investment adviser. Based on that eligibility information, the investment adviser wants to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its discretionary advisory accounts. The investment adviser does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions apply. The investment adviser is prohibited from using eligibility information received from its broker-dealer affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about its discretionary advisory accounts unless the consumer is given a notice and opportunity to opt out and the consumer does not opt out.

      (3)  The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:

      (i) By an affiliate that has or has previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer; or

      (ii) As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the affiliates on the joint notice has or has previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.

      (b) —(1)  For purposes of this subpart, you make a marketing solicitation if:

      (i) You receive eligibility information from an affiliate;

      (ii) You use that eligibility information to do one or more of the following:

      (A) Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a marketing solicitation;

      (B) Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation; or

      (C) Decide which of your products or services to market to the consumer or tailor your marketing solicitation to that consumer; and

      (iii) As a result of your use of the eligibility information, the consumer is provided a marketing solicitation.

      (2)  You may receive eligibility information from an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that information into a common database that you may access.

      (3)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, you receive or use an affiliate's eligibility information if a service provider acting on your behalf (whether an affiliate or a nonaffiliated third party) receives or uses that information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and services.

      (4)  Unless you have used eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, you do not make a marketing solicitation subject to this subpart if your affiliate:

      (i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market your products or services to the affiliate's consumer; or

      (ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer, and you do not communicate directly with the service provider regarding that use.

      (5) —(i)  You do not make a marketing solicitation subject to this subpart if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that you may access) receives eligibility information from your affiliate that your affiliate obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market your products or services to that affiliate's consumer, so long as:

      (A) Your affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market your products or services);

      (B) Your affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use your affiliate's eligibility information to market your products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to your affiliate's consumers, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose products or services may be marketed to the affiliate's consumers by the service provider, the types of products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times your affiliate's consumers may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;

      (C) Your affiliate requires the service provider to implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses your affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with the terms and conditions established by your affiliate relating to the marketing of your products or services;

      (D) Your affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and

      (E) You do not directly use your affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (ii)  (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between your affiliate and the service provider; and

      (B) The specific terms and conditions established by your affiliate as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.

      (6)  (i) A consumer has an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser that is affiliated with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer receives eligibility information about the consumer from the investment adviser. The broker-dealer uses that eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about brokerage products and services, and, as a result, the broker-dealer provides a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its brokerage services. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the broker-dealer has made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.

      (ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about brokerage products and services, the broker-dealer asks the registered investment adviser to send the marketing solicitation to the consumer and the investment adviser does so. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the broker-dealer has made a marketing solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about its products or services, and, as a result, a marketing solicitation was provided to the consumer about the broker-dealer's products and services.

      (iii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that eligibility information about consumers who have an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser is placed into a common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies may independently access and use. Without using the investment adviser's eligibility information, the broker-dealer develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the investment adviser. The investment adviser reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the selection criteria provided by the broker-dealer to determine which consumers should receive the broker-dealer's marketing materials and sends the broker-dealer's marketing materials to those consumers. Even though the broker-dealer has received eligibility information through the common database as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the investment adviser used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.

      (iv) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the registered investment adviser provides the broker-dealer's criteria to the investment adviser's service provider and directs the service provider to use the investment adviser's eligibility information to identify investment adviser consumers who meet the criteria and to send the broker-dealer's marketing materials to those consumers. The broker-dealer does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the investment adviser's information to market its products or services to the investment adviser's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.

      (v) An affiliated group of companies includes an investment company, a principal underwriter for the investment company, a retail broker-dealer, and a transfer agent that also acts as a service provider. Each affiliate in the group places information about its consumers into a common database. The service provider has access to all information in the common database. The investment company controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set forth in a written agreement between the investment company and the service provider. The written agreement also requires the service provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions established by the investment company relating to the marketing of the products and services of all affiliates, including the principal underwriter and the retail broker-dealer. In a separate written communication, the investment company specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may use the investment company's eligibility information to market the retail broker-dealer's products and services to the investment company's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of affiliated companies (including the retail broker-dealer) whose products or services may be marketed to the investment company's consumers by the service provider; the specific products or services or types of products or services that may be marketed to the investment company's consumers by the service provider; the categories of eligibility information that may be used by the service provider in marketing products or services to the investment company's consumers; the types or categories of the investment company's consumers to whom the service provider may market products or services of investment company affiliates; the number and types of marketing communications that the service provider may send to the investment company's consumers; and the length of time during which the service provider may market the products or services of the investment company's affiliates to its consumers. The investment company periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with these terms and conditions. The retail broker-dealer asks the service provider to market brokerage services to certain of the investment company's consumers. Without using the investment company's eligibility information, the retail broker-dealer develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, its marketing materials, and related instructions to the service provider. The service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information from the common database to identify the investment company's consumers to whom brokerage services will be marketed. When the retail broker-dealer's marketing materials are provided to the identified consumers, the name of the investment company is displayed on the retail broker-dealer's marketing materials, an introductory letter that accompanies the marketing materials, an account statement that accompanies the marketing materials, or the envelope containing the marketing materials. The requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have been satisfied, and the retail broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.

      (vi) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service provider to use the investment company's eligibility information to market the products and services of other affiliates to the investment company's consumers whenever the service provider deems it appropriate to do so. The service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information in accordance with the discretion afforded to it by the terms and conditions. Because the terms and conditions are not specific, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have not been satisfied.

      (c)  The provisions of this subpart do not apply to you if you use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate:

      (1) To make a marketing solicitation to a consumer with whom you have a pre-existing business relationship;

      (2) To facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit you provide employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan;

      (3) To perform services on behalf of an affiliate, except that this paragraph shall not be construed as permitting you to send marketing solicitations on behalf of an affiliate if the affiliate would not be permitted to send the marketing solicitation as a result of the election of the consumer to opt out under this subpart;

      (4) In response to a communication about your products or services initiated by the consumer;

      (5) In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to receive solicitations; or

      (6) If your compliance with this subpart would prevent you from complying with any provision of State insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination in any State in which you are lawfully doing business.

      (d) —(1)  A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The consumer also has a deposit account with the broker-dealer's affiliated depository institution. The broker-dealer receives eligibility information about the consumer from its depository institution affiliate and uses that information to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about the broker-dealer's college savings accounts. The broker-dealer may make this marketing solicitation even if the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out because the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.

      (2)  (i) A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliate, a registered investment adviser. Based on that eligibility information, the investment adviser wants to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its advisory services. The investment adviser does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply. The consumer has been given an opt out notice and has elected to opt out of receiving such marketing solicitations. The investment adviser asks a service provider to send the marketing solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may not send the marketing solicitation on behalf of the investment adviser because, as a result of the consumer's opt out election, the investment adviser is not permitted to make the marketing solicitation.

      (ii) The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except the consumer has been given an opt out notice, but has not elected to opt out. The investment adviser asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may send the marketing solicitation on behalf of the investment adviser because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the investment adviser is permitted to make the marketing solicitation.

      (3)  (i) A consumer who is the record owner of shares in an investment company initiates a communication with an affiliated registered investment adviser about advisory services. The affiliated investment adviser may use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the investment company or any other affiliate to make marketing solicitations regarding the affiliated investment adviser's services in response to the consumer-initiated communication.

      (ii) A consumer who has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer contacts the broker-dealer to request information about how to save and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type of savings or investment vehicle in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a range of different products or services offered by the broker-dealer and one or more of its affiliates may be responsive to that communication. Such products, services, and investments may include the following: investments in affiliated investment companies; investments in section 529 plans offered by the broker-dealer; or trust services offered by a different financial institution in the affiliated group. Any affiliate offering products or services that would be responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and investing for a child's college education may use eligibility information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer in response to this communication.

      (iii) A registered investment adviser makes a marketing call to the consumer without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The investment adviser leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a toll-free number to receive information about services offered by the investment adviser. If the consumer calls the toll-free number to inquire about the investment advisory services, the call is a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service, and the investment adviser may now use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make marketing solicitations to the consumer.

      (iv) A consumer calls a broker-dealer to ask about retail locations and hours, but does not request information about its products or services. The broker-dealer may not use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer because the consumer-initiated communication does not relate to the broker-dealer's products or services. Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not apply.

      (v) A consumer calls a broker-dealer to ask about retail locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer wants to stop in and find out about mutual funds (i.e., registered open-end investment companies). The customer service representative offers to provide that information by telephone and mail additional information to the consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The broker-dealer may use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about mutual funds because such marketing solicitations would respond to the consumer-initiated communication about mutual funds.

      (4)  (i) A consumer who has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer authorizes or requests information about life insurance offered by the broker-dealer's insurance affiliate. The authorization or request, whether given to the broker-dealer or the insurance affiliate, would permit the insurance affiliate to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the broker-dealer or any other affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about life insurance.

      (ii) A consumer completes an online application to open an online brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer's online application contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or request information from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.

      (iii) A consumer completes an online application to open an online brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer's online application contains a check box indicating that the consumer authorizes or requests information from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer does not deselect the check box. The consumer has not authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.

      (iv) The terms and conditions of a brokerage account agreement contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer has not authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.

      (e)  Nothing in this subpart limits the responsibility of a person to comply with the notice and opt out provisions of Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) where applicable.

      § 248.122   Scope and duration of opt out.

#### § § 248.122

      (a) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any affiliate covered by the opt out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate as described in the notice to make marketing solicitations to the consumer.

      (2) —(i)  If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an opt out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with:

      (A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with you or your affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or

      (B) Any other transaction between the consumer and you or your affiliates as described in the notice.

      (ii)  A consumer has a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate if the consumer:

      (A) Opens a brokerage account or enters into an advisory contract with you or your affiliate;

      (B) Obtains a loan for which you or your affiliate owns the servicing rights;

      (C) Purchases investment company shares in his or her own name;

      (D) Holds an investment through you or your affiliate; such as when you act or your affiliate acts as a custodian for securities or for assets in an individual retirement arrangement;

      (E) Enters into an agreement or understanding with you or your affiliate whereby you or your affiliate undertakes to arrange or broker a home mortgage loan for the consumer;

      (F) Enters into a lease of personal property with you or your affiliate; or

      (G) Obtains financial, investment, or economic advisory services from you or your affiliate for a fee.

      (3) —(i)  If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or an application that is denied, an opt out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.

      (ii)  An isolated transaction occurs if:

      (A) The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash from an account at another financial institution; or

      (B) A broker-dealer opens a brokerage account for the consumer solely for the purpose of liquidating or purchasing securities as an accommodation, i.e., on a one-time basis, without the expectation of engaging in other transactions.

      (4)  A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit marketing solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit marketing solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all marketing solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.

      (5) —(i)  A consumer must be given a new opt out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a marketing solicitation. The new opt out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt out notice would not override a prior opt out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.

      (ii)  A consumer has an advisory contract with a company that is registered with the Commission as both a broker-dealer and an investment adviser, and that is part of an affiliated group. The consumer terminates the advisory contract. One year after terminating the advisory contract, the consumer opens a brokerage account with the same company. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to opt out before the company's affiliates may make marketing solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the company in connection with the new brokerage account relationship, regardless of whether the consumer opted out in connection with the advisory contract.

      (b)  The election of a consumer to opt out must be effective for a period of at least five years (the “opt out period”) beginning when the consumer's opt out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt out in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt out period of more than five years may be established, including an opt out period that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.

      (c)  A consumer may opt out at any time.

      § 248.123   Contents of opt out notice; consolidated and equivalent notices.

#### § § 248.123

      (a) —(1)  A notice must be clear, conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:

      (i)  If the notice is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate that it is being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates providing the joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or by “the ABC bank and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;

      (ii) A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate that it applies to multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or to “the ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;

      (iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;

      (iv) That the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;

      (v) That the consumer's election will apply for the specified period of time stated in the notice and, if applicable, that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;

      (vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who may have previously opted out, such as if a notice is provided to consumers annually, that the consumer who has chosen to limit marketing solicitations does not need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and

      (vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.

      (2)  (i) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a product or service, a single opt out notice may be provided to the joint consumers. Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out.

      (ii) The opt out notice must explain how an opt out direction by a joint consumer will be treated. An opt out direction by a joint consumer may be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or each joint consumer may be permitted to opt out separately. If each joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the joint consumers must be permitted to exercise their separate rights to opt out in a single response.

      (iii) It is impermissible to require all joint consumers to opt out before implementing any opt out direction.

      (3)  If the consumer is afforded a broader right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that accurately discloses the consumer's opt out rights.

      (4)  Model notices are provided in the Appendix to this subpart.

      (b)  A notice required by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the entity providing the notice, including but not limited to the notice described in section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) and the GLBA privacy notice.

      (c)  A notice or other disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by this subpart, and that is provided to a consumer together with disclosures required by any other provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.

      § 248.124   Reasonable opportunity to opt out.

#### § § 248.124

      (a)  You must not use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to a consumer about your products or services unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by § 248.121(a)(1)(ii).

      (b)  The consumer is given a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:

      (1)  The opt out notice is mailed to the consumer. The consumer is given 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.

      (2)  (i) The opt out notice is provided electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at an Internet Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.

      (ii) The opt out notice is provided to the consumer by e-mail where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail from the person sending the notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.

      (3)  The opt out notice is provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, such as a transaction conducted on an Internet Web site. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. There is a simple process that the consumer may use to opt out at that time using the same mechanism through which the transaction is conducted.

      (4)  The opt out notice is provided to the consumer in writing at the time of an in-person transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as completing a form that requires consumers to write a “yes” or “no” to indicate their opt out preference or that requires the consumer to check one of two blank check boxes—one that allows consumers to indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to indicate that they do not want to opt out.

      (5)  The opt out notice is included in a GLBA privacy notice. The consumer is allowed to exercise the opt out within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt out under that privacy notice.

      § 248.125   Reasonable and simple methods of opting out.

#### § § 248.125

      (a)  You must not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable and simple method to opt out, as required by § 248.121(a)(1)(ii).

      (b) —(1)  Reasonable and simple methods for exercising the opt out right include:

      (i) Designating a check-off box in a prominent position on the opt out form;

      (ii) Including a reply form and a self-addressed envelope together with the opt out notice;

      (iii) Providing an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can be electronically mailed or processed at an Internet Web site, if the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information;

      (iv) Providing a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out; or

      (v) Allowing consumers to exercise all of their opt out rights described in a consolidated opt out notice that includes the GLBA privacy, FCRA affiliate sharing, and FCRA affiliate marketing opt outs, by a single method, such as by calling a single toll-free telephone number.

      (2)  Reasonable and simple methods for exercising an opt out right  include:

      (i) Requiring the consumer to write his or her own letter;

      (ii) Requiring the consumer to call or write to obtain a form for opting out, rather than including the form with the opt out notice; or

      (iii) Requiring the consumer who receives the opt out notice in electronic form only, such as through posting at an Internet Web site, to opt out solely by paper mail or by visiting a different Web site without providing a link to that site.

      (c)  Each consumer may be required to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable and simple for that consumer.

      § 248.126   Delivery of opt out notices.

#### § § 248.126

      (a)  The opt out notice must be provided so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice. For opt out notices provided electronically, the notice may be provided in compliance with either the electronic disclosure provisions in this subpart or the provisions in section 101 of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001,

      (b)  A consumer may reasonably be expected to receive actual notice if the affiliate providing the notice:

      (1) Hand-delivers a printed copy of the notice to the consumer;

      (2) Mails a printed copy of the notice to the last known mailing address of the consumer;

      (3) Provides a notice by e-mail to a consumer who has agreed to receive electronic disclosures by e-mail from the affiliate providing the notice; or

      (4) Posts the notice on the Internet Web site at which the consumer obtained a product or service electronically and requires the consumer to acknowledge receipt of the notice.

      (c)  A consumer may not reasonably be expected to receive actual notice if the affiliate providing the notice:

      (1) Only posts the notice on a sign in a branch or office or generally publishes the notice in a newspaper;

      (2) Sends the notice by e-mail to a consumer who has not agreed to receive electronic disclosures by e-mail from the affiliate providing the notice; or

      (3) Posts the notice on an Internet Web site without requiring the consumer to acknowledge receipt of the notice.

      § 248.127   Renewal of opt out elections.

#### § § 248.127

      (a) —(1)  After the opt out period expires, you may not make marketing solicitations to a consumer who previously opted out, unless:

      (i) The consumer has been given a renewal notice that complies with the requirements of this section and §§ 248.124 through 248.126, and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to renew the opt out, and the consumer does not renew the opt out; or

      (ii) An exception in § 248.121(c) applies.

      (2)  Each opt out renewal must be effective for a period of at least five years as provided in § 248.122(b).

      (3)  The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:

      (i) By the affiliate that provided the previous opt out notice, or its successor; or

      (ii) As part of a joint renewal notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, or their successors, that jointly provided the previous opt out notice.

      (b)  The renewal notice must be clear, conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:

      (1) The name of the affiliate(s) providing the notice. If the notice is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate it is being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates providing the joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or by “the ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;

      (2) A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate that it applies to multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or to “the ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;

      (3) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;

      (4) That the consumer previously elected to limit the use of certain information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;

      (5) That the consumer's election has expired or is about to expire;

      (6) That the consumer may elect to renew the consumer's previous election;

      (7) If applicable, that the consumer's election to renew will apply for the specified period of time stated in the notice and that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires; and

      (8) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.

      (c) —(1)  A renewal notice may be provided to the consumer either:

      (i) A reasonable period of time before the expiration of the opt out period; or

      (ii) Any time after the expiration of the opt out period but before marketing solicitations that would have been prohibited by the expired opt out are made to the consumer.

      (2)  If you provide an annual privacy notice under the GLBA, providing a renewal notice with the last annual privacy notice provided to the consumer before expiration of the opt out period is a reasonable period of time before expiration of the opt out in all cases.

      (d)  An opt out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration of the opt out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.

      § 248.128   Effective date, compliance date, and prospective application.

#### § § 248.128

      (a)  This subpart is effective September 10, 2009.

      (b)  Compliance with this subpart is required not later than January 1, 2010.

For purposes of this section, you are deemed to receive eligibility information when such information is placed into a common database and is accessible by you.

      § 248.202   Duties of card issuers regarding changes of address.

#### § § 248.202

      (a)  This section applies to a person described in § 248.201(a) that issues a credit or debit card (card issuer).

      (b)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means a consumer who has been issued a  or  as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(r).

      (2)  means reasonably understandable and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information presented.

      (c)  A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change of address, the card issuer:

      (1)(i) Notifies the cardholder of the request:

      (A) At the cardholder's former address; or

#### § § 255.7

      (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

      (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or

      (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      () All such profit, once allocated, is distributed to the entity (or employee or former employee thereof) promptly after being earned or, if not so distributed, is retained by the covered fund for the sole purpose of establishing a reserve amount to satisfy contractual obligations with respect to subsequent losses of the covered fund and such undistributed profit of the entity (or employee or former employee thereof) does not share in the subsequent investment gains of the covered fund;

      () Repayment of a fixed principal amount, on or before a maturity date, in a contractually-determined manner (which may include prepayment premiums intended solely to reflect, and compensate holders of the interest for, forgone income resulting from an early prepayment);

      () The holders of the interest are not entitled to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event).

      § 255.12   Permitted investment in a covered fund.

#### § § 255.12

      (a)  (1) Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in § 255.10(a) of this subpart, a banking entity may acquire and retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that the banking entity or an affiliate thereof organizes and offers pursuant to § 255.11, for the purposes of:

      (i)  Establishing the fund and providing the fund with sufficient initial equity for investment to permit the fund to attract unaffiliated investors, subject to the limits contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section; or

      (ii)  Making and retaining an investment in the covered fund subject to the limits contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      (A) Must actively seek unaffiliated investors to reduce, through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods, the aggregate amount of all ownership interests of the banking entity in the covered fund to the amount permitted in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section; and

      (B) Must, no later than 1 year after the date of establishment of the fund (or such longer period as may be provided by the Board pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section), conform its ownership interest in the covered fund to the limits in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;

      (ii)  (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in any covered fund made or held pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not exceed 3 percent of the total number or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund.

      (B) An investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in a c_o_vered fund that is an issuing entity of asset-backed securities may not exceed 3 percent of the total fair market value of the ownership interests of the fund measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless a greater percentage is retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in compliance with the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder, in which case the investment by the banking entity and its affiliates in the covered fund may not exceed the amount, number, or value of ownership interests of the fund required under section 15G of the Exchange Act and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.

      (iii)  The aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired or retained under this section may not exceed 3 percent of the tier 1 capital of the banking entity, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter.

      (iv)  For purposes of this section, the date of establishment of a covered fund shall be:

      (A)  The date on which the investment adviser or similar entity to the covered fund begins making investments pursuant to the written investment strategy for the fund;

      (ii)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a registered investment company, SEC-regulated business development companies, or foreign public fund as described in § 255.10(c)(1) will not be considered to be an affiliate of the banking entity so long as:

      (A) The banking entity, together with its affiliates, does not own, control, or hold with the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting shares of the company or fund; and

      (B) The banking entity, or an affiliate of the banking entity, provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, administrative, and other services to the company or fund in compliance with the limitations under applicable regulation, order, or other authority.

      (iii)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a covered fund will not be considered to be an affiliate of a banking entity so long as the covered fund is held in compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

      (iv)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires an ownership interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the ownership interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4), for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:

      (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment);

      (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment). If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;

      (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (3)  In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section:

      (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or

      (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.

      (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes.

      (iv) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.

      (4) —(i)  If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the “feeder fund”) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the “master fund”), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entity's permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund. The banking entity's permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and

      (ii)  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 255.11 for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a “fund of funds”) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entity's permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest in the fund that is held through the fund of funds. The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.

      (5)  (i) A banking entity shall not be required to include in the calculation of the investment limits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (ii) A banking entity shall not be restricted under this section in the amount of any investment the banking entity makes alongside a covered fund as long as the investment is made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable safety and soundness standards.

      (c)  (1)(i) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 255.10(d)(6)(ii)), on a historical cost basis;

      (ii) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (2)  For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:

      (i)  If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and

      (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:

      (A) In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;

      (B) In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:

      ()  If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier _1_ capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and

      ()  If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders' equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards.

      (iii) —(A)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards.

      (B)  With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.

      (d)  For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entity's tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of:

      (1)(i) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 255.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C of this part), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and

      (ii) The fair market value of the banking entity's ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 255.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C of this part), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.

      (2) Treatment of employee and director restricted profit interests financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires a restricted profit interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the restricted profit interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.

      (e)  (1)  Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.

      (i) Whether the investment would result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;

      (ii) The contractual terms governing the banking entity's interest in the covered fund;

      (iii) The date on which the covered fund is expected to have attracted sufficient investments from investors unaffiliated with the banking entity to enable the banking entity to comply with the limitations in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;

      (vii) The banking entity's prior efforts to reduce through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods its ownership interests in the covered fund, including activities related to the marketing of interests in such covered fund;

      (viii) Market conditions; and

      (a)  (1) The prohibition contained in § 255.10(a) of this subpart does not apply with respect to an ownership interest in a covered fund acquired or retained by a banking entity that is designed to reduce or otherwise significantly mitigate the specific, identifiable risks to the banking entity in connection with:

      (i) A compensation arrangement with an employee of the banking entity or an affiliate thereof that directly provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory or other services to the covered fund; or

      (ii) A position taken by the banking entity when acting as intermediary on behalf of a customer that is not itself a banking entity to facilitate the exposure by the customer to the profits and losses of the covered fund.

      (2) The risk-mitigating hedging activities of a banking entity are permitted under this paragraph (a) only if:

      (i) The banking entity has established and implements, maintains and enforces an internal compliance program in accordance with subpart D of this part that is reasonably designed to ensure the banking entity's compliance with the requirements of this section, including:

      (A) Reasonably designed written policies and procedures; and

      (B) Internal controls and ongoing monitoring, management, and authorization procedures, including relevant escalation procedures; and

      (ii) The acquisition or retention of the ownership interest:

      (A) Is made in accordance with the written policies, procedures, and internal controls required under this section;

      (B) At the inception of the hedge, is designed to reduce or otherwise significantly mitigate one or more specific, identifiable risks arising:

      () Out of a transaction conducted solely to accommodate a specific customer request with respect to the covered fund; or

      () In connection with the compensation arrangement with the employee that directly provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, or other services to the covered fund;

      (C) Does not give rise, at the inception of the hedge, to any significant new or additional risk that is not itself hedged contemporaneously in accordance with this section; and

      (D) Is subject to continuing review, monitoring and management by the banking entity.

      (iii) With respect to risk-mitigating hedging activity conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the compensation arrangement relates solely to the covered fund in which the banking entity or any affiliate has acquired an ownership interest pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) and such compensation arrangement provides that any losses incurred by the banking entity on such ownership interest will be offset by corresponding decreases in amounts payable under such compensation arrangement.

      (b)  (1) The prohibition contained in § 255.10(a) of this subpart does not apply to the acquisition or retention of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund by a banking entity only if:

      (i) The banking entity is not organized or directly or indirectly controlled by a banking entity that is organized under the laws of the United States or of one or more States;

      (ii) The activity or investment by the banking entity is pursuant to paragraph (9) or (13) of section 4(c) of the BHC Act;

      (iii) No ownership interest in the covered fund is offered for sale or sold to a resident of the United States; and

      (iv) The activity or investment occurs solely outside of the United States.

      (2) An activity or investment by the banking entity is pursuant to paragraph (9) or (13) of section 4(c) of the BHC Act for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section only if:

      (i) The activity or investment is conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section; and

      (ii)(A) With respect to a banking entity that is a foreign banking organization, the banking entity meets the qualifying foreign banking organization requirements of section 211.23(a), (c) or (e) of the Board's Regulation K (12 CFR 211.23(a), (c) or (e)), as applicable; or

      (B) With respect to a banking entity that is not a foreign banking organization, the banking entity is not organized under the laws of the United States or of one or more States and the banking entity, on a fully-consolidated basis, meets at least two of the following requirements:

      () Total assets of the banking entity held outside of the United States exceed total assets of the banking entity held in the United States;

      () Total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity outside of the United States exceed total revenues derived from the business of the banking entity in the United States; or

      () Total net income derived from the business of the banking entity outside of the United States exceeds total net income derived from the business of the banking entity in the United States.

      (3) An ownership interest in a covered fund is not offered for sale or sold to a resident of the United States for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section only if it is not sold and has not been sold pursuant to an offering that targets residents of the United States in which the banking entity or any affiliate of the banking entity participates. If the banking entity or an affiliate sponsors or serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor to a covered fund, then the banking entity or affiliate will be deemed for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3) to participate in any offer or sale by the covered fund of ownership interests in the covered fund.

      (4) An activity or investment occurs solely outside of the United States for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section only if:

      (i) The banking entity acting as sponsor, or engaging as principal in the acquisition or retention of an ownership interest in the covered fund, is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located in the United States or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State;

      (ii) The banking entity (including relevant personnel) that makes the decision to acquire or retain the ownership interest or act as sponsor to the covered fund is not located in the United States or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State; and

      (iii) The investment or sponsorship, including any transaction arising from risk-mitigating hedging related to an ownership interest, is not accounted for as principal directly or indirectly on a consolidated basis by any branch or affiliate that is located in the United States or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State.

      (5) For purposes of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign bank, or any subsidiary thereof, is located in the United States; however, a foreign bank of which that branch, agency, or subsidiary is a part is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operation of the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (c) Permitted covered fund interests and activities by a regulated insurance company. The prohibition contained in § 255.10(a) of this subpart does not apply to the acquisition or retention by an insurance company, or an affiliate thereof, of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund only if:

      (1) The insurance company or its affiliate acquires and retains the ownership interest solely for the general account of the insurance company or for one or more separate accounts established by the insurance company;

      (2) The acquisition and retention of the ownership interest is conducted in compliance with, and subject to, the insurance company investment laws and regulations of the State or jurisdiction in which such insurance company is domiciled; and

      (3) The appropriate Federal banking agencies, after consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the relevant insurance commissioners of the States and foreign jurisdictions, as appropriate, have not jointly determined, after notice and comment, that a particular law or regulation described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity, or the financial stability of the United States.

      (d)  (1) The prohibition contained in § 255.10(a) does not apply to a qualifying foreign excluded fund.

      (2) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a qualifying foreign excluded fund means a banking entity that:

      (i) Is organized or established outside the United States, and the ownership interests of which are offered and sold solely outside the United States;

      (ii)(A) Would be a covered fund if the entity were organized or established in the United States, or

      (B) Is, or holds itself out as being, an entity or arrangement that raises money from investors primarily for the purpose of investing in financial instruments for resale or other disposition or otherwise trading in financial instruments;

      (iii) Would not otherwise be a banking entity except by virtue of the acquisition or retention of an ownership interest in, sponsorship of, or relationship with the entity, by another banking entity that meets the following:

      (A) The banking entity is not organized, or directly or indirectly controlled by a banking entity that is organized, under the laws of the United States or of any State; and

      (B) The banking entity's acquisition of an ownership interest in or sponsorship of the fund by the foreign banking entity meets the requirements for permitted covered fund activities and investments solely outside the United States, as provided in § 255.13(b);

      (iv) Is established and operated as part of a bona fide asset management business; and

      (v) Is not operated in a manner that enables the banking entity that sponsors or controls the qualifying foreign excluded fund, or any of its affiliates, to evade the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part.

      § 255.14   Limitations on relationships with a covered fund.

#### § § 255.14

      (a)  (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 255.11 of this subpart, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 255.11(b) of this subpart, and no affiliate of such entity, may enter into a transaction with the covered fund, or with any other covered fund that is controlled by such covered fund, that would be a covered transaction as defined in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b)(7)), as if such banking entity and the affiliate thereof were a member bank and the covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a banking entity may:

      (i) Acquire and retain any ownership interest in a covered fund in accordance with the requirements of §§ 255.11, 255.12, or 255.13;

      (ii) Enter into any prime brokerage transaction with any covered fund in which a covered fund managed, sponsored, or advised by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof) has taken an ownership interest, if:

      (A) The banking entity is in compliance with each of the limitations set forth in § 255.11 of this subpart with respect to a covered fund organized and offered by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof);

      (B) The chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) of the banking entity certifies in writing annually no later than March 31 to the SEC (with a duty to update the certification if the information in the certification materially changes) that the banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee, assume, or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such covered fund invests; and

      (C) The Board has not determined that such transaction is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation and condition of the banking entity; and

      (iii) Enter into a transaction with a covered fund that would be an exempt covered transaction under 12 U.S.C. 371c(d) or § 223.42 of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42) subject to the limitations specified under 12 U.S.C. 371c(d) or § 223.42 of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42), as applicable,

      (B) Each extension of credit is repaid, sold, or terminated by the end of five business days; and

      (C) The banking entity making each extension of credit meets the requirements of § 223.42(l)(1)(i) and (ii) of the Board's Regulation W (12 CFR 223.42(l)(1)(i) and(ii)), as if the extension of credit was an intraday extension of credit, regardless of the duration of the extension of credit.

      (3) Any transaction or activity permitted under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (iv) or (v) must comply with the limitations in § 255.15.

      (b)  A banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, or that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 255.11 of this subpart, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 255.11(b) of this subpart, shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1), as if such banking entity were a member bank and such covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

      (c)  Any transaction permitted under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1) as if the counterparty were an affiliate of the banking entity under section 23B.

      § 255.15   Other limitations on permitted covered fund activities.

#### § § 255.15

      (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 255.11 through 255.13 of this subpart if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:

      (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

      (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or

      (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:

      (i)  (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and

      (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or

      (ii)  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

      (2)  means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

#### § § 255.16

      (1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;

      (2) The banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in Qualifying TruPS Collateral; and

      (3) The banking entity acquired such interest on or before December 10, 2013 (or acquired such interest in connection with a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that acquired the interest on or before December 10, 2013).

      (b) For purposes of this § 255.16,  shall mean any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that, as of the end of any reporting period within 12 months immediately preceding the issuance of such trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument, had total consolidated assets of less than $15,000,000,000 or issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a mutual holding company.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a banking entity may act as a market maker with respect to the interests of an issuer described in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§ 255.4 and 255.11.

      (d) Without limiting the applicability of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board, the FDIC and the OCC will make public a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of paragraph (a). A banking entity may rely on the list published by the Board, the FDIC and the OCC.

      (1) Documentation of the exclusions or exemptions other than sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 relied on by each fund sponsored by the banking entity (including all subsidiaries and affiliates) in determining that such fund is not a covered fund;

      (2) For each fund sponsored by the banking entity (including all subsidiaries and affiliates) for which the banking entity relies on one or more of the exclusions from the definition of covered fund provided by §§ 255.10(c)(1),255.10(c)(5), 255.10(c)(8), 255.10(c)(9), or 255.10(c)(10) of subpart C, documentation supporting the banking entity's determination that the fund is not a covered fund pursuant to one or more of those exclusions;

      (5) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign banking entity is located in the United States; however, the foreign bank that operates or controls that branch, agency, or subsidiary is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operating or controlling the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.

      (f) —(1)  A banking entity that does not engage in activities or investments pursuant to subpart B or subpart C (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 255.6(a) of subpart B) may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing the required compliance program prior to becoming engaged in such activities or making such investments (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 255.6(a) of subpart B).

      (g) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a banking entity with limited trading assets and liabilities shall be presumed to be compliant with subpart B and subpart C of this part and shall have no obligation to demonstrate compliance with this part on an ongoing basis.

      (2)  If upon examination or audit, the SEC determines that the banking entity has engaged in proprietary trading or covered fund activities that are otherwise prohibited under subpart B or subpart C of this part, the SEC may require the banking entity to be treated under this part as if it did not have limited trading assets and liabilities. The SEC's rebuttal of the presumption in this paragraph must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the SEC retains its authority to require a banking entity without significant trading assets and liabilities to apply any requirements of this part that would otherwise apply if the banking entity had significant or moderate trading assets and liabilities if the SEC determines that the size or complexity of the banking entity's trading or investment activities, or the risk of evasion of subpart B or subpart C of this part, does not warrant a presumption of compliance under paragraph (g) of this section or treatment as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities, as applicable. The SEC's exercise of this reservation of authority must be made in accordance with the notice and response procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (i) —(1)  The SEC will notify the banking entity in writing of any determination requiring notice under this part and will provide an explanation of the determination.

      (2)  The banking entity may respond to any or all items in the notice described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The response should include any matters that the banking entity would have the SEC consider in deciding whether to make the determination. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated SEC official within 30 days after the date on which the banking entity received the notice. The SEC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the SEC, the activities or condition of the banking entity so requires, provided that the banking entity is informed of the time period at the time of notice, or with the consent of the banking entity. In its discretion, the SEC may extend the time period for good cause.

      (3)  Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the SEC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the SEC's determination.

      (4)  The SEC will notify the banking entity of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision.

#### § § 270.0-4

    (a)  Except as provided by this section or in the appropriate form, information may be incorporated by reference in answer, or partial answer, to any item of a registration statement or report. Where an item requires a summary or outline of the provisions of any document, the summary or outline may incorporate by reference particular items, sections, or paragraphs of any exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such reference.

    (b)  Except as provided in the Commission's rules, financial information required to be given in comparative form for two or more fiscal years or periods must not be incorporated by reference unless the information incorporated by reference includes the entire period for which the comparative data is given. In the financial statements, incorporating by reference, or cross-referencing to, information outside of the financial statements is not permitted unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission's rules or by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, whichever is applicable.

    (c)  Any document or part thereof, including any financial statement or part thereof, filed with the Commission pursuant to any Act administered by the Commission may be incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any registration statement, application, or report filed with the Commission by the same or any other person. If any modification has occurred in the text of any document incorporated by reference since the filing thereof, the registrant must file with the reference a statement containing the text of any such modification and the date thereof.

    (d)  Include an active hyperlink to information incorporated into a registration statement, application, or report by reference if such information is publicly available on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (“EDGAR”) at the time the registration statement, application, or report is filed. For hyperlinking to exhibits, please refer to the appropriate form.

    (e)  Include an express statement clearly describing the specific location of the information you are incorporating by reference. The statement must identify the document where the information was originally filed or submitted and the location of the information within that document. The statement must be made at the particular place where the information is required, if applicable. Information must not be incorporated by reference in any case where such incorporation would render the disclosure incomplete, unclear, or confusing. For example, unless expressly permitted or required, disclosure must not be incorporated by reference from a second document if that second document incorporates information pertinent to such disclosure by reference to a third document.

    § 270.2a-1   Valuation of portfolio securities in special cases.

#### § § 270.2a-1

    (a) Any investment company whose securities are qualified for sale, or for whose securities application for such qualification has been made, in any State in which the securities owned by such company are required by applicable State law or regulations to be valued at cost or on some other basis different from that prescribed by clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act for the purpose of determining the percentage of its assets invested in any particular type or classification of securities or in the securities of any one issuer, may, in valuing its securities for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the Act, use the same basis of valuation as that used in complying with such State law or regulations in lieu of the method of valuation prescribed by clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act.

    (b) Any open-end company which has heretofore valued its securities at cost for the purpose of qualifying as a “mutual investment company” under the Internal Revenue Code, prior to its amendment by the Revenue Act of 1942, shall henceforth, for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the Act, value its securities in accordance with the method prescribed in clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act unless such company is permitted under paragraph (a) of this section to use a different method of valuation.

    (c) A registered investment company which has adopted for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the Act a method of valuation permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, shall state in its registration statement filed pursuant to section 8 (54 Stat. 803; 15 U.S.C. 80a-8) of the Act, or in a report filed pursuant to section 30 (54 Stat. 836; 15 U.S.C. 80a-30) of the Act, the method of valuation adopted and the facts which justify the adoption of such method. A registered investment company which has adopted for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the Act a method of valuation permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, unless it shall have adopted such method for the purpose or partly for the purpose of qualifying as a “mutual investment company” under the Internal Revenue Code, shall continue to use that method until it has notified the Commission of its desire to use a different method, and has received from the Commission permission for such change. Such permission may be made effective on a fixed date or within such reasonable time thereafter as may be deemed advisable under the circumstances.

    (d) If at any time it appears that the method of valuation adopted by any company pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is no longer justified by the facts, the Commission may require a change in the method of valuation within a reasonable period of time either to the method prescribed in clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act or to some other method permitted by paragraph (a) of this section which is justified by the existing facts.

#### § § 270.2a-4

    (a) The current net asset value of any redeemable security issued by a registered investment company used in computing periodically the current price for the purpose of distribution, redemption, and repurchase means an amount which reflects calculations, whether or not recorded in the books of account, made substantially in accordance with the following, with estimates used where necessary or appropriate.

    (1) Portfolio securities with respect to which market quotations are readily available shall be valued at current market value, and other securities and assets shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the registered company.

    (2) Changes in holdings of portfolio securities shall be reflected no later than in the first calculation on the first business day following the trade date.

    (3) Changes in the number of outstanding shares of the registered company resulting from distributions, redemptions, and repurchases shall be reflected no later than in the first calculation on the first business day following such change.

    (4) Expenses, including any investment advisory fees, shall be included to date of calculation. Appropriate provision shall be made for Federal income taxes if required. Investment companies which retain realized capital gains designated as a distribution to shareholders shall comply with paragraph (h) of § 210.6-03 of Regulation S-X.

    (5) Dividends receivable shall be included to date of calculation either at ex-dividend dates or record dates, as appropriate.

    (6) Interest income and other income shall be included to date of calculation.

    (b) The items which would otherwise be required to be reflected by paragraphs (a) (4) and (6) of this section need not be so reflected if cumulatively, when netted, they do not amount to as much as one cent per outstanding share.

    (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, any interim determination of current net asset value between calculations made as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the preceding business day and the current business day may be estimated so as to reflect any change in current net asset value since the closing calculation on the preceding business day.

    (2)  Performing each of the following, taking into account the fund's valuation risks:

    (i) Selecting and applying in a consistent manner an appropriate methodology or methodologies for determining (and calculating) the fair value of fund investments, provided that a selected methodology may be changed if a different methodology is equally or more representative of the fair value of fund investments, including specifying the key inputs and assumptions specific to each asset class or portfolio holding;

    (ii) Periodically reviewing the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodologies selected and making any necessary changes or adjustments thereto; and

    (iii) Monitoring for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value;

    (3)  Testing the appropriateness and accuracy of the fair value methodologies that have been selected, including identifying the testing methods to be used and the minimum frequency with which such testing methods are to be used; and

    (4)  Overseeing pricing service providers, if used, including establishing the process for approving, monitoring, and evaluating each pricing service provider and initiating price challenges as appropriate.

    (b)  The board of the fund must determine fair value in good faith for any or all fund investments by carrying out the functions required in paragraph (a) of this section. The board may choose to designate the valuation designee to perform the fair value determination relating to any or all fund investments, which shall carry out all of the functions required in paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the requirements of this paragraph (b).

    (1)  The board oversees the valuation designee, and the valuation designee reports to the fund's board, in writing, including such information as may be reasonably necessary for the board to evaluate the matters covered in the report, as follows:

    (i)  (A) At least quarterly:

    () Any reports or materials requested by the board related to the fair value of designated investments or the valuation designee's process for fair valuing fund investments; and

    () A summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter, including:

    () Any mater_i_al changes in the assessment and management of valuation risks required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including any material changes in conflicts of interest of the valuation designee (and any other service provider);

    () Any material changes to, or material deviations from, the fair value methodologies established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

    () Any material changes to the valuation designee's process for selecting and overseeing pricing services, as well as any material events related to the valuation designee's oversight of pricing services; and

    (B) At least annually, an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the valuation designee's process for determining the fair value of the designated portfolio of investments, including, at a minimum:

    () A summary of the results of the testing of fair value methodologies required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

    () An assessment of the adequacy of resources allocated to the process for determining the fair value of designated investments, including any material changes to the roles or functions of the persons responsible for determining fair value under paragraph (b)(_2_) of this section; and

    (ii)  The valuation designee notifies the board of the occurrence of matters that materially affect the fair value of the designated portfolio of investments, including a significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or effectiveness of the valuation designee's fair value determination process, or material errors in the calculation of net asset value, (any such matter or error, a “material matter”) within a time period determined by the board (but in no event later than five business days after the valuation designee becomes aware of the material matter), with such timely follow-on reporting as the board may determine appropriate; and

    (2)  The valuation designee specifies the titles of the persons responsible for determining the fair value of the designated investments, including by specifying the particular functions for which they are responsible, and reasonably segregates fair value determinations from the portfolio management of the fund such that the portfolio manager(s) may not determine, or effectively determine by exerting substantial influence on, the fair values ascribed to portfolio investments.

    (c)  For purposes of section 2(a)(41) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41)), a market quotation is readily available only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the fund can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable.

    (d)  If the fund is a unit investment trust, and the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the unit investment trust occurs  March 8, 2021, the fund's trustee or depositor must carry out the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the unit investment trust occurred  March 8, 2021, and an entity other than the fund's trustee or depositor has been designated to carry out the fair value determination, that entity must carry out the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

    (e)  For purposes of this section:

    (1)  means a registered investment company or business development company.

    (2)  means the value of a portfolio investment for which market quotations are not readily available under paragraph (c) of this section.

    (3)  means either the fund's entire board of directors or a designated committee of such board composed of a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund.

    (4)  means the investment adviser, other than a sub-adviser, of a fund or, if the fund does not have an investment adviser, an officer or officers of the fund.

    (b) —(1)  It shall be an untrue statement of material fact within the meaning of section 34(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)) for a registered investment company, in any registration statement, application, report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to the Act, including any advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to prospective investors that is required to be filed with the Commission by section 24(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)), to hold itself out to investors as a money market fund or the equivalent of a money market fund, unless such registered investment company complies with this section.

    (2)  It shall constitute the use of a materially deceptive or misleading name or title within the meaning of section 35(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-34(d)) for a registered investment company to adopt the term “money market” as part of its name or title or the name or title of any redeemable securities of which it is the issuer, or to adopt a name that suggests that it is a money market fund or the equivalent of a money market fund, unless such registered investment company complies with this section.

    (3)  For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a name that suggests that a registered investment company is a money market fund or the equivalent thereof includes one that uses such terms as “cash,” “liquid,” “money,” “ready assets” or similar terms.

    (c) —(1)  (i) The current price per share, for purposes of distribution, redemption and repurchase, of any redeemable security issued by a government money market fund or retail money market fund, notwithstanding the requirements of section 2(a)(41) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41)) and of §§ 270.2a-4 and 270.22c-1 thereunder, may be computed by use of the amortized cost method and/or the penny-rounding method. To use these methods, the board of directors of the government or retail money market fund must determine, in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders to maintain a stable net asset value per share or stable price per share, by virtue of either the amortized cost method and/or the penny-rounding method. The government or retail money market fund may continue to use such methods only so long as the board of directors believes that they fairly reflect the market-based net asset value per share and the fund complies with the other requirements of this section.

    (ii) Any money market fund that is not a government money market fund or a retail money market fund must compute its price per share for purposes of distribution, redemption and repurchase by rounding the fund's current net asset value per share to a minimum of the fourth decimal place in the case of a fund with a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market funds with a different share price (e.g. $10.000 per share, or $100.00 per share).

    (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, and notwithstanding section 27(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-27(i)) and § 270.22c-1:

    (i)  If the fund's board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the fund, determines that a liquidity fee is in the best interests of the fund, the fund must institute a liquidity fee (not to exceed two percent of the value of the shares redeemed).

    (A)  Once imposed, a discretionary liquidity fee must be applied to all shares redeemed and must remain in effect until the money market fund's board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the fund, determines that imposing such liquidity fee is no longer in the best interests of the fund.

    (B)  The requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) do not apply to a government money market fund. A government money market fund may, however, choose to rely on the ability to impose discretionary liquidity fees consistent with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) and any other requirements that apply to liquidity fees ( Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form N-1A (§ 274.11A of this chapter)).

    (ii)  If a money market fund that is not a government money market fund or a retail money market fund has total daily net redemptions that exceed five percent of the fund's net assets, or such smaller amount of net redemptions as the board determines, based on flow information available within a reasonable period after the last computation of the fund's net asset value on that day, the fund must apply a liquidity fee to all shares that are redeemed at a price computed on that day, in an amount determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

    (iii)  The amount of a mandatory liquidity fee must be determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) or (D) of this section.

    (A)  The fee amount must be based on a good faith estimate, supported by data, of the costs the fund would incur if it sold a pro rata amount of each security in its portfolio to satisfy the amount of net redemptions, including:

    () Spread costs, such that the fund is valuing each security at its bid price, and any other charges, fees, and taxes associated with portfolio security sales; and

    () Market impacts for each security. The fund must determine market impacts by first establishing a market impact factor for each security, which is a good faith estimate of the percentage change in the value of the security if it were sold, per dollar of the amount of the security that would be sold if the fund sold a pro rata amount of each security in its portfolio to satisfy the amount of net redemptions under current market conditions and, second, multiplying the market impact factor by the dollar amount of the security that would be sold. A fund may assume a market impact of zero for its daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets.

    (B)  For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, a fund may estimate costs and market impacts for each type of security with the same or substantially similar characteristics and apply those estimates to all securities of that type rather than analyze each security separately.

    (C)  If the costs of selling a pro rata amount of each portfolio security cannot be estimated in good faith and supported by data, the liquidity fee amount is one percent of the value of shares redeemed.

    (D)  A fund is not required to apply a liquidity fee if the amount of the fee determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is less than 0.01% of the value of the shares redeemed.

    (iv)  Notwithstanding section 27(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-27(i)), a variable insurance contract issued by a registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or the sponsoring insurance company of such separate account may apply a liquidity fee pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section to contract owners who allocate all or a portion of their contract value to a subaccount of the separate account that is either a money market fund or that invests all of its assets in shares of a money market fund.

    (v)  Any money market fund (“feeder fund”) that owns, pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(E)), shares of another money market fund (“master fund”) may not impose liquidity fees under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided however, that if a master fund, in which the feeder fund invests, imposes a liquidity fee pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, then the feeder fund shall pass through to its investors the fee on the same terms and conditions as imposed by the master fund.

    (3)  A money market fund may not reduce the number of its shares outstanding to seek to maintain a stable net asset value per share or stable price per share unless:

    (i) The money market fund calculates its share price pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;

    (ii) The fund has negative gross yield as a result of negative interest rates (“negative interest rate event”);

    (iii) The board of directors determines that reducing the number of the fund's shares outstanding is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders; and

    (iv) Timely, concise, and plain English disclosure is provided to investors about the fund's share cancellation practices and their effects on investors, including:

    (A) Advance notification to investors in the fund's prospectus that the fund plans to use share cancellation in a negative interest rate event and the potential effects on investors; and

    (B) When the fund is cancelling shares, information in each account statement or in a separate writing accompanying each account statement identifying that such practice is in use and explaining its effects on investors.

    (d) —(1)  The money market fund must maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity appropriate to its investment objective; provided, however, that the money market fund must not:

    (i) Acquire any instrument with a remaining maturity of greater than 397 calendar days;

    (ii) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity (“WAM”) that exceeds 60 calendar days, with the dollar-weighted average based on the percentage of each security's market value in the portfolio; or

    (iii) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 120 calendar days, determined without reference to the exceptions in paragraph (i) of this section regarding interest rate readjustments (“WAL”) and with the dollar-weighted average based on the percentage of each security's market value in the portfolio.

    (2) —(i)  The money market fund must limit its portfolio investments to those United States dollar-denominated securities that at the time of acquisition are eligible securities.

    (ii)  A security that is subject to a guarantee may be determined to be an eligible security based solely on whether the guarantee is an eligible security, provided however, that the issuer of the guarantee, or another institution, has undertaken to promptly notify the holder of the security in the event the guarantee is substituted with another guarantee (if such substitution is permissible under the terms of the guarantee).

    (iii)  A security that is subject to a conditional demand feature (“underlying security”) may be determined to be an eligible security only if:

    (A) The conditional demand feature is an eligible security;

    (B) The underlying security or any guarantee of such security is an eligible security, except that the underlying security or guarantee may have a remaining maturity of more than 397 calendar days.

    (C) At the time of the acquisition of the underlying security, the money market fund's board of directors has determined that there is minimal risk that the circumstances that would result in the conditional demand feature not being exercisable will occur; and

    () The conditions limiting exercise either can be monitored readily by the fund or relate to the taxability, under federal, state or local law, of the interest payments on the security; or

    () The terms of the conditional demand feature require that the fund will receive notice of the occurrence of the condition and the opportunity to exercise the demand feature in accordance with its terms; and

    (D) The issuer of the conditional demand feature, or another institution, has undertaken to promptly notify the holder of the security in the event the conditional demand feature is substituted with another conditional demand feature (if such substitution is permissible under the terms of the conditional demand feature).

    (3) —(i)  The money market fund must be diversified with respect to issuers of securities acquired by the fund as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, other than with respect to government securities.

    (A)  Immediately after the acquisition of any security, a money market fund other than a single state fund must not have invested more than:

    () Five percent of its total assets in securities issued by the issuer of the security, provided, however, that with respect to paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, such a fund may invest up to twenty-five percent of its total assets in the securities of a single issuer for a period of up to three business days after the acquisition thereof; provided, further, that the fund may not invest in the securities of more than one issuer in accordance with the foregoing proviso in this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A)() at any time; and

    () Ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee, provided, however, that a tax exempt fund need only comply with this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A)() with respect to eighty-five percent of its total assets, subject to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

    (B)  Immediately after the acquisition of any security, a single state fund must not have invested:

    () With respect to seventy-five percent of its total assets, more than five percent of its total assets in securities issued by the issuer of the security; and

    () With respect to seventy-five percent of its total assets, more than ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee, subject to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

    (ii)  For purposes of making calculations under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:

    (A)  The acquisition of a repurchase agreement may be deemed to be an acquisition of the underlying securities, provided the obligation of the seller to repurchase the securities from the money market fund is collateralized fully and the fund's board of directors has evaluated the seller's creditworthiness.

    (B)  The acquisition of a refunded security shall be deemed to be an acquisition of the escrowed government securities.

    (C)  A conduit security shall be deemed to be issued by the person (other than the municipal issuer) ultimately responsible for payments of interest and principal on the security.

    (D) —()  An asset-backed security acquired by a fund (“primary ABS”) shall be deemed to be issued by the special purpose entity that issued the asset-backed security, provided, however:

    ()  Any person whose obl_i_gations constitute ten percent or more of the principal amount of the qualifying assets of the primary ABS (“ten percent obligor”) shall be deemed to be an issuer of the portion of the primary ABS such obligations represent; and

    ()  If a ten percent obligor of a primary ABS is itself a special purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities (“secondary ABS”), any ten percent obligor of such secondary ABS also shall be deemed to be an issuer of the portion of the primary ABS that such ten percent obligor represents.

    ()  A ten percent obligor with respect to a primary or secondary ABS shall not be deemed to have issued any portion of the assets of a primary ABS as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D)() of this section if that ten percent obligor is itself a special purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities (“restricted special purpose entity”), and the securities that it issues (other than securities issued to a company that controls, or is controlled by or under common control with, the restricted special purpose entity and which is not itself a special purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities) are held by only one other special purpose entity.

    ()  In the case of a ten percent obligor deemed to be an issuer, the fund must satisfy the diversification requirements of paragraph (d)_(3_)(iii) of this section with respect to any demand feature or guarantee to which the ten percent obligor's obligations are subject.

    (E)  A money market fund that acquires shares issued by another money market fund in an amount that would otherwise be prohibited by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section shall nonetheless be deemed in compliance with this section if the board of directors of the acquiring money market fund reasonably believes that the fund in which it has invested is in compliance with this section.

    (F) —()  The money market fund, when calculating the amount of its total assets invested in securities issued by any particular issuer for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, must treat as a single issuer two or more issuers of securities owned by the money market fund if one issuer controls the other, is controlled by the other issuer, or is under common control with the other issuer, provided that “control” for this purpose means ownership of more than 50 percent of the issuer's voting securities.

    ()  The money market fund is not required to aggregate an asset-backed commercial paper special purpose entity and its equity owners under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section provided that a primary line of business of its equity owners is owning equity interests in special purpose entities and providing services to special purpose entities, the independent equity owners' activities with respect to the SPEs are limited to providing management or administrative services, and no qualifying assets of the special purpose entity were originated by the equity owners.

    ()  For purposes of determ_i_ning ten percent obligors pursuant to paragraph (d)(_3_)(ii)(D)() of this section, the money market fund must treat as a single person two or more persons whose obligations in the aggregate constitute ten percent or more of the principal amount of the qualifying assets of the primary ABS if one person controls the other, is controlled by the other person, or is under common control with the person, provided that “control” for this purpose means ownership of more than 50 percent of the person's voting securities.

    (iii)  The money market fund must be diversified with respect to demand features and guarantees acquired by the fund as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (iii), and (iv) of this section, other than with respect to a demand feature issued by the same institution that issued the underlying security, or with respect to a guarantee or demand feature that is itself a government security.

    (A)  Immediately after the acquisition of any demand feature or guarantee, any security subject to a demand feature or guarantee, or a security directly issued by the issuer of a demand feature or guarantee, a money market fund must not have invested more than ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee, subject to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.

    (B)  Immediately after the acquisition of any demand feature or guarantee, any security subject to a demand feature or guarantee, or a security directly issued by the issuer of a demand feature or guarantee (any such acquisition, a “demand feature or guarantee acquisition”), a tax exempt fund, with respect to eighty-five percent of its total assets, must not have invested more than ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee; provided that any demand feature or guarantee acquisition in excess of ten percent of the fund's total assets in accordance with this paragraph must be a demand feature or guarantee issued by a non-controlled person.

    (iv) —(A)  In the case of a security subject to a demand feature or guarantee from an institution by which the institution guarantees a specified portion of the value of the security, the institution shall be deemed to guarantee the specified portion thereof.

    (B)  In the case of a security subject to demand features or guarantees from multiple institutions that have not limited the extent of their obligations as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, each institution shall be deemed to have provided the demand feature or guarantee with respect to the entire principal amount of the security.

    (v)  A money market fund that satisfies the applicable diversification requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) and (e) of this section shall be deemed to have satisfied the diversification requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1)) and the rules adopted thereunder.

    (4)  The money market fund must hold securities that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of the fund's obligations under section 22(e) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e)) and any commitments the fund has made to shareholders; provided, however, that:

    (i)  The money market fund may not acquire any illiquid security if, immediately after the acquisition, the money market fund would have invested more than five percent of its total assets in illiquid securities.

    (ii)  The money market fund may not acquire any security other than a daily liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested less than twenty-five percent of its total assets in daily liquid assets. This provision does not apply to tax exempt funds.

    (iii)  The money market fund may not acquire any security other than a weekly liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested less than fifty percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets.

    (e)  If the fund's board of directors has determined that the fund is not relying on a demand feature or guarantee to determine the quality (pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section), or maturity (pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section), or liquidity of a portfolio security (pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section), and maintains a record of this determination (pursuant to paragraphs (g)(3) and (h)(7) of this section), then the fund may disregard such demand feature or guarantee for all purposes of this section.

    (f) —(1)  Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section with respect to a portfolio security, the money market fund shall dispose of such security as soon as practicable consistent with achieving an orderly disposition of the security, by sale, exercise of any demand feature or otherwise, absent a finding by the board of directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the best interests of the money market fund (which determination may take into account, among other factors, market conditions that could affect the orderly disposition of the portfolio security):

    (i) The default with respect to a portfolio security (other than an immaterial default unrelated to the financial condition of the issuer);

    (ii) A portfolio security ceases to be an eligible security (e.g., no longer presents minimal credit risks); or

    (iii) An event of insolvency occurs with respect to the issuer of a portfolio security or the provider of any demand feature or guarantee.

    (2)  The money market fund must notify the Commission of the occurrence of certain material events, as specified in Form N-CR (§ 274.222 of this chapter).

    (3)  For purposes of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, an instrument subject to a demand feature or guarantee shall not be deemed to be in default (and an event of insolvency with respect to the security shall not be deemed to have occurred) if:

    (i) In the case of an instrument subject to a demand feature, the demand feature has been exercised and the fund has recovered either the principal amount or the amortized cost of the instrument, plus accrued interest;

    (ii) The provider of the guarantee is continuing, without protest, to make payments as due on the instrument; or

    (iii) The provider of a guarantee with respect to an asset-backed security pursuant to paragraph (a)(16)(ii) of this section is continuing, without protest, to provide credit, liquidity or other support as necessary to permit the asset-backed security to make payments as due.

    (4)  (i) The money market fund must notify its board of directors within one business day following the occurrence of:

    (A) The money market fund investing less than twelve and a half percent of its total assets in daily liquid assets; or

    (B) The money market fund investing less than twenty-five percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets.

    (ii) Following an event described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the money market fund must provide its board of directors with a brief description of the facts and circumstances leading to such event within four business days after occurrence of the event.

    (g)  The money market fund's board of directors must adopt written procedures including the following:

    (1)  In the case of a government or retail money market fund that uses the amortized cost method of valuation, in supervising the money market fund's operations and delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to the money market fund's investment adviser, the money market fund's board of directors, as a particular responsibility within the overall duty of care owed to its shareholders, shall establish written procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the money market fund's investment objectives, to stabilize the money market fund's net asset value per share, as computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase, at a single value.

    (i)  Included within the procedures adopted by the board of directors shall be the following:

    (A)  Written procedures shall provide:

    () That the extent of deviation, if any, of the current net asset value per share calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) from the money market fund's amortized cost price per share, shall be calculated at least daily, and at such other intervals that the board of directors determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions;

    () For the periodic review by the board of directors of the amount of the deviation as well as the methods used to calculate the deviation; and

    () For the maintenance of records of the determination of deviation and the board's review thereof.

    (B)  In the event such deviation from the money market fund's amortized cost price per share exceeds   of 1 percent, the board of directors shall promptly consider what action, if any, should be initiated by the board of directors.

    (C)  Where the board of directors believes the extent of any deviation from the money market fund's amortized cost price per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders, it shall cause the fund to take such action as it deems appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable such dilution or unfair results.

    (ii) [Reserved]

    (2)  In the case of a government or retail money market fund that uses the penny rounding method of pricing, in supervising the money market fund's operations and delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to the money market fund's investment adviser, the money market fund's board of directors, as a particular responsibility within the overall duty of care owed to its shareholders, must establish written procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the money market fund's investment objectives, to assure to the extent reasonably practicable that the money market fund's price per share as computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase, rounded to the nearest one percent, will not deviate from the single price established by the board of directors.

    (3)  The written procedures must require the adviser to provide ongoing review of whether each security (other than a government security) continues to present minimal credit risks. The review must:

    (i) Include an assessment of each security's credit quality, including the capacity of the issuer or guarantor (including conditional demand feature provider, when applicable) to meet its financial obligations; and

    (ii) Be based on, among other things, financial data of the issuer of the portfolio security or provider of the guarantee or demand feature, as the case may be, and in the case of a security subject to a conditional demand feature, the issuer of the security whose financial condition must be monitored under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, whether such data is publicly available or provided under the terms of the security's governing documents.

    (4)  In the case of a security subject to one or more demand features or guarantees that the fund's board of directors has determined that the fund is not relying on to determine the quality (pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section), maturity (pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section) or liquidity (pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section) of the security subject to the demand feature or guarantee, written procedures must require periodic evaluation of such determination.

    (5)  In the case of a variable rate or floating rate security that is not subject to a demand feature and for which maturity is determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(1), (i)(2) or (i)(4) of this section, written procedures shall require periodic review of whether the interest rate formula, upon readjustment of its interest rate, can reasonably be expected to cause the security to have a market value that approximates its amortized cost value.

    (6)  In the case of an asset-backed security, written procedures must require the fund to periodically determine the number of ten percent obligors (as that term is used in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section) deemed to be the issuers of all or a portion of the asset-backed security for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section; provided, however, written procedures need not require periodic determinations with respect to any asset-backed security that a fund's board of directors has determined, at the time of acquisition, will not have, or is unlikely to have, ten percent obligors that are deemed to be issuers of all or a portion of that asset-backed security for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, and maintains a record of this determination.

    (7)  In the case of an asset-backed security for which the fund's board of directors has determined that the fund is not relying on the sponsor's financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support in connection with the asset-backed security to determine the quality (pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) or liquidity (pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section) of the asset-backed security, written procedures must require periodic evaluation of such determination.

    (8)  Written procedures must provide for:

    (i)  The periodic stress testing, at such intervals as the board of directors determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions, of the money market fund's ability to maintain the sufficient liquidity levels identified in its written procedures, and the fund's ability to minimize principal volatility (and, in the case of a money market fund using the amortized cost method of valuation or penny rounding method of pricing as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the fund's ability to maintain the stable price per share established by the board of directors for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase), based upon specified hypothetical events that include, but are not limited to:

In addition the agreement of each officer and director will contain provisions similar to those contained in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

    (2) That every agreement and undertaking of the applicant, its officers, directors, investment adviser, principal underwriter and custodian required by this section (i) constitute inducements to the Commission for the issuance and continuance in effect of, and conditions to, the Commission's order to be entered under this section; (ii) constitute a contract among applicant and applicant's shareholders with the same intent as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section; and (iii) failure by the applicant or any of the above enumerated persons to comply with any such agreement and undertaking, unless permitted by the Commission, shall constitute a violation of the order entered under this section.

    (3) That the Commission, in its discretion, may revoke its order permitting registration of the applicant and the public offering of its securities if it shall find after notice and opportunity for hearing that there shall have been a violation of such order or the act and may determine whether distribution of applicant's assets is necessary or appropriate in the interests of investors and may so direct.

    (a) As used in this section:

    (1)  shall mean any sales load, including a contingent deferred sales load, that is deducted upon redemption or annuitization of amounts representing all or a portion of a securityholder's interest in a separate account;

    (2)  shall include not only the security or securities (or portion[s] thereof) of a securityholder actually exchanged pursuant to an exchange offer but also any security or securities (or portion[s] thereof) of the securityholder previously exchanged for the exchanged security or its predecessors;

    (4)  as used in paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(2) of this section, shall not include any purchase payments made for the exchanged security or any appreciation attributable to those purchase payments that are transferred to the offering account in connection with an exchange.

    (b) Notwithstanding section 11 of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-11], any registered separate account or any principal underwriter for such an account (collectively, the “offering account”) may make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of the offering account, or of any other registered separate account having the same insurance company depositor or sponsor as the offering account or having an insurance company depositor or sponsor that is an affiliate of the offering account's depositor or sponsor, to exchange his security (or portion thereof) (the “exchanged security”) for a security (or portion thereof) of the offering account (the “acquired security”) without the terms of such exchange offer first having been submitted to and approved by the Commission, as provided below:

    (1) If the securities (or portions thereof) involved are variable annuity contracts, then

    (i) The exchange must be made on the basis of the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchanged, except that the offering account may deduct at the time of the exchange

    (B) Any front-end sales load permitted by paragraph (c) of this section, and

    (ii) Any deferred sales load imposed on the acquired security by the offering account shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section; or

    (2) If the securities (or portions thereof) involved are variable life insurance contracts offered by a separate account registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, then the exchange must be made on the basis of the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchanged, except that the offering account may deduct at the time of the exchange an administrative fee which is disclosed in the part of the offering account's registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 relating to the prospectus.

    (c) If the offering account imposes a front-end sales load on the acquired security, then such sales load shall be a percentage that is no greater than the excess of the rate of the front-end sales load otherwise applicable to that security over the rate of any front-end sales load previously paid on the exchanged security.

    (d) If the offering account imposes a deferred sales load on the acquired security and the exchanged security was also subject to a deferred sales load, then any deferred sales load imposed on the acquired security shall be calculated as if:

    (1) The holder of the acquired security had been the holder of that security from the date on which he became the holder of the exchanged security; and

    (2) Purchase payments made for the exchanged security had been made for the acquired security on the date on which they were made for the exchanged security.

    (e) If the offering account imposes a deferred sales load on the acquired security and a front-end sales load was paid on the exchanged security, then any deferred sales load imposed on the acquired security may not be imposed on purchase payments made for the exchanged security or any appreciation attributable to purchase payments made for the exchanged security that are transferred in connection with the exchange.

    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no offer of exchange shall be made in reliance on this section if both a front-end sales load and a deferred sales load are to be imposed on the acquired security or if both such sales loads are imposed on the exchanged security.

    (i) The percentage rate of any sales load charged when the acquired security is redeemed, that is solely the result of a deferred sales load imposed on the exchanged security, may be no greater than the excess, if any, of the applicable rate of such sales load, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section, over the sum of the rates of all sales loads previously paid on the acquired security, and

    (ii) In no event may the sum of the rates of all sales loads imposed prior to and at the time the acquired security is redeemed, including any sales load paid or to be paid with respect to the exchanged security, exceed the maximum sales load rate, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section, that would be applicable in the absence of an exchange to the security (exchanged or acquired) with the highest such rate;

    (5) Any deferred sales load charged at the time the acquired security is redeemed is calculated as if the holder of the acquired security had held that security from the date on which he became the holder of the exchanged security,

    (i) The existence of any administrative fee or redemption fee that would be imposed at the time of an exchange; and

    (ii) If the offering company reserves the right to change the terms of or terminate the exchange offer, that the exchange offer is subject to termination and its terms are subject to change;

    (8) Whenever an exchange offer is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security subject to that offer shall be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least 60 days prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment,

    (i) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate an administrative fee, sales load or redemption fee payable at the time of an exchange, and

    (ii) No notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either

    (A) There is a suspension of the redemption of the exchanged security under section 22(e) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e)] and the rules and regulations thereunder, or

    (B) The offering company temporarily delays or ceases the sale of the acquired security because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions; and

    (9) In calculating any sales load charged with respect to the acquired security:

    (i) If a securityholder exchanges less than all of his securities, the security upon which the highest sales load rate was previously paid is deemed exchanged first; and

    (ii) If the exchanged security was acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, that security is deemed to have been sold with a sales load rate equal to the sales load rate previously paid on the security on which the dividend was paid or distribution made.

    (c) If either no sales load is imposed on the acquired security or the sales load imposed is less than the maximum allowed by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the offering company may require the exchanging securityholder to have held the exchanged security for a minimum period of time previously established by the offering company and applied uniformly to all securityholders of the class specified.

    (d) Any offering company that has previously made an offer of exchange may continue to impose fees or sales loads permitted by an order under section 11(a) of the Act upon shares purchased before the earlier of (1) One year after the effective date of this section, or (2) When the offer has been brought into compliance with the terms of this section, and upon shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions based on such shares, until such shares are redeemed.

    (e) Any offering company that has previously made an offer of exchange cannot rely on this section to amend such prior offer unless

    (1) The offering company's prospectus disclosed, during at least the two year period prior to the amendment of the offer (or, if the fund is less than two years old, at all times the offer has been outstanding) that the terms of the offer were subject to change, or

    (2) If any class or series of securities of a series company fails to approve an investment advisory contract in the manner required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the investment adviser of such company may continue to serve or act in such capacity for the period of time pending such required approval of such contract, of a new contract with the same or different adviser, or other definitive action:  That the compensation received by such investment adviser during such period is equal to no more than its actual costs incurred in furnishing investment advisory services to such class or series or the amount it would have received under the advisory contract, whichever is less.

    Notwithstanding sections 18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(1) and (i), respectively), a registered open-end management investment company or series or class thereof established in accordance with section 18(f)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(2)) whose shares are registered on Form N-1A [§§ 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter] (“company”) may issue more than one class of voting stock,  that:

    (a) Each class:

    (1)(i) Shall have a different arrangement for shareholder services or the distribution of securities or both, and shall pay all of the expenses of that arrangement;

    (ii) May pay a different share of other expenses, not including advisory or custodial fees or other expenses related to the management of the company's assets, if these expenses are actually incurred in a different amount by that class, or if the class receives services of a different kind or to a different degree than other classes; and

    (iii) May pay a different advisory fee to the extent that any difference in amount paid is the result of the application of the same performance fee provisions in the advisory contract of the company to the different investment performance of each class;

    (2) Shall have exclusive voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to its arrangement;

    (3) Shall have separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one class differ from the interests of any other class; and

    (4) Shall have in all other respects the same rights and obligations as each other class.

    (b) Expenses may be waived or reimbursed by the company's adviser, underwriter, or any other provider of services to the company.

    (c)(1) Income, realized gains and losses, unrealized appreciation and depreciation, and Fundwide Expenses shall be allocated based on one of the following methods (which method shall be applied on a consistent basis):

    (i) To each class based on the net assets of that class in relation to the net assets of the company (“relative net assets”);

    (ii) To each class based on the Simultaneous Equations Method;

    (iii) To each class based on the Settled Shares Method,  the company is a Daily Dividend Fund (such a company may allocate income and Fundwide Expenses based on the Settled Shares Method and realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation based on relative net assets);

    (iv) To each share without regard to class,  the company is a Daily Dividend Fund that maintains the same net asset value per share in each class; that the company has received undertakings from its adviser, underwriter, or any other provider of services to the company, agreeing to waive or reimburse the company for payments to such service provider by one or more classes, as allocated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to the extent necessary to assure that all classes of the company maintain the same net asset value per share; and that payments waived or reimbursed under such an undertaking may not be carried forward or recouped at a future date; or

    (v) To each class based on any other appropriate method,  a majority of the directors of the company, and a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the company, determine that the method is fair to the shareholders of each class and that the annualized rate of return of each class will generally differ from that of the other classes only by the expense differentials among the classes.

    (2) For purposes of this section:

    (i)  means any company that has a policy of declaring distributions of net income daily, including any money market fund that operates in compliance with § 270.2a-7;

    (ii)  means expenses of the company not allocated to a particular class under paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

    (iii) The  means allocating to each class based on relative net assets, excluding the value of subscriptions receivable; and

    (iv) The  means the simultaneous allocation to each class of each day's income, realized gains and losses, unrealized appreciation and depreciation, and Fundwide Expenses and reallocation to each class of undistributed net investment income, undistributed realized gains or losses, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation, based on the operating results of the company, changes in ownership interests of each class, and expense differentials between the classes, so that the annualized rate of return of each class generally differs from that of the other classes only by the expense differentials among the classes.

    (d) Any payments made under paragraph (a) of this section shall be made pursuant to a written plan setting forth the separate arrangement and expense allocation of each class, and any related conversion features or exchange privileges. Before the first issuance of a share of any class in reliance upon this section, and before any material amendment of a plan, a majority of the directors of the company, and a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the company, shall find that the plan as proposed to be adopted or amended, including the expense allocation, is in the best interests of each class individually and the company as a whole; initial board approval of a plan under this paragraph (d) is not required, however, if the plan does not make any change in the arrangements and expense allocations previously approved by the board under an existing order of exemption. Before any vote on the plan, the directors shall request and evaluate, and any agreement relating to a class arrangement shall require the parties thereto to furnish, such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the plan.

    (e) The board of directors of the investment company satisfies the fund governance standards defined in § 270.0-1(a)(7).

    (f) Nothing in this section prohibits a company from offering any class with:

    (1) An exchange privilege providing that securities of the class may be exchanged for certain securities of another company; or

    (2) A conversion feature providing that shares of one class of the company (the “purchase class”) will be exchanged automatically for shares of another class of the company (the “target class”) after a specified period of time,

    (i) The conversion is effected on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge;

    (ii) The expenses, including payments authorized under a plan adopted pursuant to § 270.12b-1 (“rule 12b-1 plan”), for the target class are not higher than the expenses, including payments authorized under a rule 12b-1 plan, for the purchase class; and

    (iii) If the shareholders of the target class approve any increase in expenses allocated to the target class under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section, and the purchase class shareholders do not approve the increase, the company will establish a new target class for the purchase class on the same terms as applied to the target class before that increase.

    (3) A conversion feature providing that shares of a class in which an investor is no longer eligible to participate may be converted to shares of a class in which that investor is eligible to participate,

    (i) The investor is given prior notice of the proposed conversion; and

    (ii) The conversion is effected on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge.

    § 270.18f-4   Exemption from the requirements of section 18 and section 61 for certain senior securities transactions.

#### § § 270.18f-4

    (a)  For purposes of this section:

    means that the VaR of the fund's portfolio does not exceed 20% of the value of the fund's net assets, or in the case of a closed-end company that has issued to investors and has then outstanding shares of a class of senior security that is a stock, that the VaR of the fund's portfolio does not exceed 25% of the value of the fund's net assets.

    means the sum of the gross notional amounts of the fund's derivatives transactions described in paragraph (1) of the definition of the term “derivatives transaction” of this section, and in the case of short sale borrowings, the value of the assets sold short. If a fund's derivatives transactions include reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the fund's derivatives exposure also includes, for each transaction, the proceeds received but not yet repaid or returned, or for which the associated liability has not been extinguished, in connection with the transaction. In determining derivatives exposure a fund may convert the notional amount of interest rate derivatives to 10-year bond equivalents and delta adjust the notional amounts of options contracts and exclude any closed-out positions, if those positions were closed out with the same counterparty and result in no credit or market exposure to the fund.

    means an officer or officers of the fund's investment adviser responsible for administering the program and policies and procedures required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that the derivatives risk manager:

    (1) May not be a portfolio manager of the fund, or if multiple officers serve as derivatives risk manager, may not have a majority composed of portfolio managers of the fund; and

    (2) Must have relevant experience regarding the management of derivatives risk.

    means the risks associated with a fund's derivatives transactions or its use of derivatives transactions, including leverage, market, counterparty, liquidity, operational, and legal risks and any other risks the derivatives risk manager (or, in the case of a fund that is a limited derivatives user as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the fund's investment adviser) deems material.

    means:

    (1) Any swap, security-based swap, futures contract, forward contract, option, any combination of the foregoing, or any similar instrument (“derivatives instrument”), under which a fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise;

    (2) Any short sale borrowing; and

    (3) If a fund relies on paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, any reverse repurchase agreement or similar financing transaction.

    means an unleveraged index that is approved by the derivatives risk manager for purposes of the relative VaR test and that reflects the markets or asset classes in which the fund invests and is not administered by an organization that is an affiliated person of the fund, its investment adviser, or principal underwriter, or created at the request of the fund or its investment adviser, unless the index is widely recognized and used. In the case of a blended index, none of the indexes that compose the blended index may be administered by an organization that is an affiliated person of the fund, its investment adviser, or principal underwriter, or created at the request of the fund or its investment adviser, unless the index is widely recognized and used.

    means a _designated index_ or the fund's securities portfolio. Notwithstanding the first sentence of the definition of  of this section, if the fund's investment objective is to track the performance (including a leverage multiple or inverse multiple) of an unleveraged index, the fund must use that index as its designated reference portfolio.

    means a registered open-end or closed-end company or a business development company, including any separate series thereof, but does not include a registered open-end company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7.

    means a fund that seeks, directly or indirectly, to provide investment returns that correspond to the performance of a market index by a specified multiple (“leverage multiple”), or to provide investment returns that have an inverse relationship to the performance of a market index (“inverse multiple”), over a predetermined period of time.

    means that the VaR of the fund's portfolio does not exceed 200% of the VaR of the designated reference portfolio, or in the case of a closed-end company that has issued to investors and has then outstanding shares of a class of senior security that is a stock, that the VaR of the fund's portfolio does not exceed 250% of the VaR of the designated reference portfolio.

    means the fund's portfolio of securities and other investments, excluding any derivatives transactions, that is approved by the derivatives risk manager for purposes of the relative VaR test, provided that the fund's securities portfolio reflects the markets or asset classes in which the fund invests ( the markets or asset classes in which the fund invests directly through securities and other investments and indirectly through derivatives transactions).

    means a contract that is not a derivatives transaction, under which a fund commits, conditionally or unconditionally, to make a loan to a company or to invest equity in a company in the future, including by making a capital commitment to a private fund that can be drawn at the discretion of the fund's general partner.

    or  means an estimate of potential losses on an instrument or portfolio, expressed as a percentage of the value of the portfolio's assets (or net assets when computing a fund's _VaR_), over a specified time horizon and at a given confidence level, provided that any VaR model used by a fund for purposes of determining the fund's compliance with the relative VaR test or the absolute VaR test must:

    (i) Equity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk;

    (c) —(1)  The fund adopts and implements a written derivatives risk management program (“program”), which must include policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the fund's derivatives risks and to reasonably segregate the functions associated with the program from the portfolio management of the fund. The program must include the following elements:

    (i)  The program must provide for the identification and assessment of the fund's derivatives risks. This assessment must take into account the fund's derivatives transactions and other investments.

    (ii)  The program must provide for the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of investment, risk management, or related guidelines that provide for quantitative or otherwise measurable criteria, metrics, or thresholds of the fund's derivatives risks. These guidelines must specify levels of the given criterion, metric, or threshold that the fund does not normally expect to exceed, and measures to be taken if they are exceeded.

    (iii)  The program must provide for stress testing to evaluate potential losses to the fund's portfolio in response to extreme but plausible market changes or changes in market risk factors that would have a significant adverse effect on the fund's portfolio, taking into account correlations of market risk factors and resulting payments to derivatives counterparties. The frequency with which the stress testing under this paragraph is conducted must take into account the fund's strategy and investments and current market conditions, provided that these stress tests must be conducted no less frequently than weekly.

    (iv)  The program must provide for backtesting to be conducted no less frequently than weekly, of the results of the VaR calculation model used by the fund in connection with the relative VaR test or the absolute VaR test by comparing the fund's gain or loss that occurred on each business day during the backtesting period with the corresponding VaR calculation for that day, estimated over a one-trading day time horizon, and identifying as an exception any instance in which the fund experiences a loss exceeding the corresponding VaR calculation's estimated loss.

    (v) —(A)  The program must identify the circumstances under which persons responsible for portfolio management will be informed regarding the operation of the program, including exceedances of the guidelines specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the results of the stress tests specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.

    (B)  The derivatives risk manager must inform in a timely manner persons responsible for portfolio management of the fund, and also directly inform the fund's board of directors as appropriate, of material risks arising from the fund's derivatives transactions, including risks identified by the fund's exceedance of a criterion, metric, or threshold provided for in the fund's risk guidelines established under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section or by the stress testing described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.

    (vi)  The derivatives risk manager must review the program at least annually to evaluate the program's effectiveness and to reflect changes in risk over time. The periodic review must include a review of the VaR calculation model used by the fund under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (including the backtesting required by paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section) and any designated reference portfolio to evaluate whether it remains appropriate.

    (2)  (i) The fund must comply with the relative VaR test unless the derivatives risk manager reasonably determines that a designated reference portfolio would not provide an appropriate reference portfolio for purposes of the relative VaR test, taking into account the fund's investments, investment objectives, and strategy. A fund that does not apply the relative VaR test must comply with the absolute VaR test.

    (ii) The fund must determine its compliance with the applicable VaR test at least once each business day. If the fund determines that it is not in compliance with the applicable VaR test, the fund must come back into compliance promptly after such determination, in a manner that is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders.

    (iii) If the fund is not in compliance with the applicable VaR test within five business days:

    (A) The derivatives risk manager must provide a written report to the fund's board of directors and explain how and by when ( number of business days) the derivatives risk manager reasonably expects that the fund will come back into compliance;

    (B) The derivatives risk manager must analyze the circumstances that caused the fund to be out of compliance for more than five business days and update any program elements as appropriate to address those circumstances; and

    (C) The derivatives risk manager must provide a written report within thirty calendar days of the exceedance to the fund's board of directors explaining how the fund came back into compliance and the results of the analysis and updates required under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. If the fund remains out of compliance with the applicable VaR test at that time, the derivatives risk manager's written report must update the report previously provided under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and the derivatives risk manager must update the board of directors on the fund's progress in coming back into compliance at regularly scheduled intervals at a frequency determined by the board.

    (3) —(i)  A fund's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund, must approve the designation of the derivatives risk manager.

    (ii)  On or before the implementation of the program, and at least annually thereafter, the derivatives risk manager must provide to the board of directors a written report providing a representation that the program is reasonably designed to manage the fund's derivatives risks and to incorporate the elements provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section. The representation may be based on the derivatives risk manager's reasonable belief after due inquiry. The written report must include the basis for the representation along with such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the adequacy of the fund's program and, for reports following the program's initial implementation, the effectiveness of its implementation. The written report also must include, as applicable, the derivatives risk manager's basis for the approval of any designated reference portfolio or any change in the designated reference portfolio during the period covered by the report; or an explanation of the basis for the derivatives risk manager's determination that a designated reference portfolio would not provide an appropriate reference portfolio for purposes of the relative VaR test.

    (iii)  The derivatives risk manager must provide to the board of directors, at a frequency determined by the board, a written report regarding the derivatives risk manager's analysis of exceedances described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the results of the stress testing conducted under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and the results of the backtesting conducted under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section since the last report to the board.

    (C) Any determination and/or action the fund made under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, including a fund's determination of: The VaR of its portfolio; the VaR of the fund's designated reference portfolio, as applicable; the fund's VaR ratio (the value of the VaR of the fund's portfolio divided by the VaR of the designated reference portfolio), as applicable; and any updates to any VaR calculation models used by the fund and the basis for any material changes thereto.

    (ii)  (A) A fund must maintain a copy of the written policies and procedures that the fund adopted under paragraph (c)(1) or (4) of this section that are in effect, or at any time within the past five years were in effect, in an easily accessible place.

    (B) A fund must maintain all records and materials that paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(A)() through () and (c)(6)(i)(B) through (D) of this section describe for a period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) following each determination, action, or review that these paragraphs describe.

    (7)  A fund that experiences an event specified in the parts of Form N-RN [referenced in 17 CFR 274.223] titled “Relative VaR Test Breaches,” “Absolute VaR Test Breaches,” or “Compliance with VaR Test” must file with the Commission a report on Form N-RN within the period and according to the instructions specified in that form.

    (d)  (1) A fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, notwithstanding the requirements of sections 18(c) and 18(f)(1) of the Investment Company Act, if the fund:

    (ii) Treats all reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as derivatives transactions for all purposes under this section.

    (2) A fund relying on paragraph (d) of this section must maintain a written record documenting whether the fund is relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section for a period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) following the determination.

    (e)  (1) A fund may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement, notwithstanding the requirements of sections 18(a), 18(c), 18(f)(1), and 61 of the Investment Company Act, if the fund reasonably believes, at the time it enters into such agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as they come due. In forming a reasonable belief, the fund must take into account its reasonable expectations with respect to other obligations (including any obligation with respect to senior securities or redemptions), and may not take into account cash that may become available from the sale or disposition of any investment at a price that deviates significantly from the market value of those investments, or from issuing additional equity. Unfunded commitment agreements entered into by the fund in compliance with this section will not be considered for purposes of computing asset coverage, as defined in section 18(h) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(h)).

    (2) For each unfunded commitment agreement that a fund enters into under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a fund must document the basis for its reasonable belief regarding the sufficiency of its cash and cash equivalents to meet its unfunded commitment agreement obligations, and maintain a record of this documentation for a period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) following the date that the fund entered into the agreement.

    (f)  Notwithstanding the requirements of sections 18(a)(1), 18(c), 18(f)(1), and 61 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(a)(1), 80a018(c), 80a-18(f)(1), and 80a-60), a fund or registered open-end company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 may invest in a security on a when-issued or forward-settling basis, or with a non-standard settlement cycle, and the transaction will be deemed not to involve a senior security, provided that: The fund intends to physically settle the transaction; and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date.

    § 270.19a-1   Written statement to accompany dividend payments by management companies.

#### § § 270.19a-1

    (a) Every written statement made pursuant to section 19 by or on behalf of a management company shall be made on a separate paper and shall clearly indicate what portion of the payment per share is made from the following sources:

    (1) Net income for the current or preceding fiscal year, or accumulated undistributed net income, or both, not including in either case profits or losses from the sale of securities or other properties.

    (2) Accumulated undistributed net profits from the sale of securities or other properties (except that an open-end company may treat as a separate source its net profits from such sales during its current fiscal year).

    (3) Paid-in surplus or other capital source.

    (b) If the payment is made in whole or in part from a source specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section the written statement shall indicate, after giving effect to the part of such payment so specified, the deficit, if any, in the aggregate of (1) accumulated undistributed realized profits less losses on the sale of securities or other properties and (2) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of portfolio securities, all as of a date reasonably close to the end of the period as of which the dividend is paid. Any statement made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall specify the amount, if any, of such deficit which represents unrealized depreciation of portfolio securities.

    (c) Accumulated undistributed net income and accumulated undistributed net profits from the sale of securities or other properties shall be determined, at the option of the company, either (1) from the date of the organization of the company, (2) from the date of a reorganization, as defined in clause (A) or (B) of section 2(a)(33) of the Act (54 Stat. 790; 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(33)), (3) from the date as of which a write-down of portfolio securities was made in connection with a corporate readjustment, approved by stockholders, of the type known as “quasi- reorganization,” or (4) from January 1, 1925, to the close of the period as of which the dividend is paid, without giving effect to such payment.

    (d) For the purpose of this section, open-end companies which upon the sale of their shares allocate to undistributed income or other similar account that portion of the consideration received which represents the approximate per share amount of undistributed net income included in the sales price, and make a corresponding deduction from undistributed net income upon the purchase or redemption of shares, need not treat the amounts so allocated as paid-in surplus or other capital source.

    (e) For the purpose of this section, the source or sources from which a dividend is paid shall be determined (or reasonably estimated) to the close of the period as of which it is paid without giving effect to such payment. If any such estimate is subsequently ascertained to be inaccurate in a significant amount, a correction thereof shall be made by a written statement pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act or in the first report to stockholders following discovery of the inaccuracy.

    (f) Insofar as a written statement made pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act relates to a dividend on preferred stock paid for a period of less than a year, a company may elect to indicate only that portion of the payment which is made from sources specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and need not specify the sources from which the remainder was paid. Every company which in any fiscal year elects to make a statement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall transmit to the holders of such preferred stock, at a date reasonably near the end of the last dividend period in such fiscal year, a statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section on an annual basis.

    (g) The purpose of this section, in the light of which it shall be construed, is to afford security holders adequate disclosure of the sources from which dividend payments are made. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the inclusion in any written statement of additional information in explanation of the information required by this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a dividend payment in violation of any State law or to prevent compliance with any requirement of State law regarding dividends consistent with this rule.

    § 270.19b-1   Frequency of distribution of capital gains.

#### § § 270.19b-1

    (a) No registered investment company which is a “regulated investment company” as defined in section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”) shall distribute more than one capital gain dividend (“distribution”), as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Code, with respect to any one taxable year of the company, other than a distribution otherwise permitted by this rule or made pursuant to section 855 of the Code which is supplemental to the prior distribution with respect to the same taxable year of the company and which does not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount distributed for such taxable year.

    (b) No registered investment company which is not a “regulated investment company” as defined in section 851 of the Code shall make more than one distribution of long-term capital gains, as defined in the Code, in any one taxable year of the company:  That a unit investment trust may distribute capital gain dividends received from a “regulated investment company” within a reasonable time after receipt.

    (c) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to a unit investment trust (hereinafter referred to as the “Trust”) engaged exclusively in the business of investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in Rule 14a-3(b) (17 CFR 270.14a-3(b)) under this Act);  That:

    (1) The capital gain distribution is a result of—

    (i) An issuer's calling or redeeming an eligible trust security held by the Trust,

    (ii) The sale of an eligible trust security by the Trust to provide funds for redemption of Trust units when the amount received by the Trust for such sale exceeds the amount required to satisfy the redemption distribution,

    (iii) The sale of an eligible trust security to maintain qualification of the Trust as a “regulated investment company” under section 851 of the Code,

    (iv) Regular distributions of principal and prepayment of principal on eligible trust securities, or

    (v) The sale of an eligible trust security in order to maintain the investment stability of the Trust; and

    (2) Capital gains distributions are clearly described as such in a report to the unitholder which accompanies each such distribution.

    (d) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, sales made to maintain the investment stability of the Trust means sales made to prevent deterioration of the value of the eligible trust securities held in the Trust portfolio when one or more of the following factors exist:

    (1) A default in the payment of principal or interest on an eligible trust security;

    (2) An action involving the issuer of an eligible trust security which adversely affects the ability of such issuer to continue payment of principal or interest on its eligible trust securities; or

    (3) A change in market, revenue or credit factors which adversely affects the ability of such issuer to continue payment of principal or interest on its eligible trust securities.

    (e) If a registered investment company because of unforeseen circumstances in a particular taxable year proposes to make a distribution which would be prohibited by the provisions of this section, it may file a request with the Commission for authorization to make such a distribution. Such request shall comply with the requirements of § 270.0-2 of this chapter and shall set forth the pertinent facts and explain the circumstances which the company believes justify such distribution. The request shall be deemed granted unless the Commission within 15 days after receipt thereof shall deny such request as not being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and notify the company in writing of such denial.

    (f) A registered investment company may make one additional distribution of long-term capital gains, as defined in the Code, with respect to any one taxable year of the company, which distribution is made, in whole or in part, for the purpose of not incurring any tax under section 4982 of the Code. Such additional distribution may be made prior or subsequent to any distribution otherwise permitted by paragraph (a) of this section.

Unless the solicitation is made in respect of a security registered on a national securities exchange, none of the soliciting material need be filed with such exchange.

    (b) If the solicitation is made by or on behalf of the management of the investment company, then the investment adviser or any prospective investment adviser and any affiliated person thereof as to whom information is required in the solicitation shall upon request of the investment company promptly transmit to the investment company all information necessary to enable the management of such company to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to such solicitation. If the solicitation is made by any person other than the management of the investment company, on behalf of and with the consent of the investment adviser or prospective investment adviser, then the investment adviser or prospective investment adviser and any affiliated person thereof as to whom information is required in the solicitation shall upon request of the person making the solicitation promptly transmit to such person all information necessary to enable such person to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the solicitation.

    § 270.22c-1   Pricing of redeemable securities for distribution, redemption and repurchase.

#### § § 270.22c-1

    (a) No registered investment company issuing any redeemable security, no person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security, and no principal underwriter of, or dealer in, any such security shall sell, redeem, or repurchase any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security:  That:

    (1) This paragraph shall not prevent a sponsor of a unit investment trust (hereinafter referred to as the “Trust”) engaged exclusively in the business of investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in Rule 14a-3(b) (17 CFR 270.14a-3(b))) from selling or repurchasing Trust units in a secondary market at a price based on the offering side evaluation of the eligible trust securities in the Trust's portfolio, determined at any time on the last business day of each week, effective for all sales made during the following week, if on the days that such sales or repurchases are made the sponsor receives a letter from a qualified evaluator stating, in its opinion, that:

    (i) In the case of repurchases, the current bid price is not higher than the offering side evaluation, computed on the last business day of the previous week; and

    (ii) In the case of resales, the offering side evaluation, computed as of the last business day of the previous week, is not more than one-half of one percent ($5.00 on a unit representing $1,000 principal amount of eligible trust securities) greater than the current offering price.

    (2) This paragraph shall not prevent any registered investment company from adjusting the price of its redeemable securities sold pursuant to a merger, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of the assets of a company which meets the conditions specified in § 270.17a-8.

    (3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (a), a registered open-end management investment company (but not a registered open-end management investment company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an exchange-traded fund as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section) (a “fund”) may use swing pricing to adjust its current net asset value per share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding redeemable securities as a result of shareholder purchase or redemption activity, provided that it has established and implemented swing pricing policies and procedures in compliance with the paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.

    (i) The fund's swing pricing policies and procedures must:

    (A) Provide that the fund must adjust its net asset value per share by a single swing factor or multiple factors that may vary based on the swing threshold(s) crossed once the level of net purchases into or net redemptions from such fund has exceeded the applicable swing threshold for the fund. In determining whether the fund's level of net purchases or net redemptions has exceeded the applicable swing threshold(s), the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing shall be permitted to make such determination based on receipt of sufficient information about the fund investors' daily purchase and redemption activity (“investor flow”) to allow the fund to reasonably estimate whether it has crossed the swing threshold(s) with high confidence, and shall exclude any purchases or redemptions that are made in kind and not in cash. This investor flow information may consist of individual, aggregated, or netted orders, and may include reasonable estimates where necessary.

    (B) Specify the process for how the fund's swing threshold(s) shall be determined, considering:

    The size, frequency, and volatility of historical net purchases or net redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed periods;

    The fund's investment strategy and the liquidity of the fund's portfolio investments;

    The fund's holdings of cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing arrangements and other funding sources; and

    The costs associated with transactions in the markets in which the fund invests.

    (C) Specify the process for how the swing factor(s) shall be determined, which must include: The establishment of an upper limit on the swing factor(s) used, which may not exceed two percent of net asset value per share; and the determination that the factor(s) used are reasonable in relationship to the costs discussed in this paragraph. In determining the swing factor(s) and the upper limit, the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing may take into account only the near-term costs expected to be incurred by the fund as a result of net purchases or net redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor(s) is used, including spread costs, transaction fees and charges arising from asset purchases or asset sales resulting from those purchases or redemptions, and borrowing-related costs associated with satisfying redemptions.

    (ii) The fund's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund must:

    (A) Approve the fund's swing pricing policies and procedures;

    (B) Approve the fund's swing threshold(s) and the upper limit on the swing factor(s) used, and any changes to the swing threshold(s) or the upper limit on the swing factor(s) used;

    (C) Designate the fund's investment adviser, officer, or officers responsible for administering the swing pricing policies and procedures (“person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing”). The administration of swing pricing must be reasonably segregated from portfolio management of the fund and may not include portfolio managers; and

    (D) Review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing that describes:

    () Its review of the adequacy of the fund's swing pricing policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation, including the impact on mitigating dilution;

    Any material changes to the fund's swing pricing policies and procedures since the date of the last report; and

    () Its review and assessment of the fund's swing threshold(s), swing factor(s), and swing factor upper limit considering the requirements of paragraphs (a)(_3_)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, including the information and data supporting the determination of the swing threshold(s), swing factor(s), and swing factor upper limit.

    (iii) The fund shall maintain the policies and procedures adopted by the fund under this paragraph (a)(3) that are in effect, or at any time within the past six years were in effect, in an easily accessible place, and shall maintain a written copy of the report provided to the board under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section for six years, the first two in an easily accessible place.

    (iv) Any fund (a “feeder fund”) that invests, pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(E)), in another fund (a “master fund”) may not use swing pricing to adjust the feeder fund's net asset value per share; however, a master fund may use swing pricing to adjust the master fund's net asset value per share, pursuant to the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a)(3).

    (v) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3):

    (A)  means an open-end management investment company (or series or class thereof), the shares of which are listed and traded on a national securities exchange, and that has formed and operates under an exemptive order under the Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule adopted by the Commission.

    (B)  means the amount, expressed as a percentage of the fund's net asset value and determined pursuant to the fund's swing pricing policies and procedures, by which a fund adjusts its net asset value per share once a fund's applicable swing threshold has been exceeded.

    (C)  means the process of adjusting a fund's current net asset value per share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding redeemable securities as a result of shareholder purchase and redemption activity, pursuant to the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a)(3).

    (D)  means an amount of net purchases or net redemptions, expressed as a percentage of the fund's net asset value, that triggers the application of swing pricing.

    (E)  means brokerage commissions, custody fees, and any other charges, fees, and taxes associated with portfolio asset purchases and sales.

    (b) For the purposes of this section,

    (1) The current net asset value of any such security shall be computed no less frequently than once daily, Monday through Friday, at the specific time or times during the day that the board of directors of the investment company sets, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, except on:

    (i) Days on which changes in the value of the investment company's portfolio securities will not materially affect the current net asset value of the investment company's redeemable securities;

    (ii) Days during which no security is tendered for redemption and no order to purchase or sell such security is received by the investment company; or

    (iii) Customary national business holidays described or listed in the prospectus and local and regional business holidays listed in the prospectus; and

    (2) A “qualified evaluator” shall mean any evaluator which represents it is in a position to determine, on the basis of an informal evaluation of the eligible trust securities held in the Trust's portfolio, whether—

    (i) The current bid price is higher than the offering side evaluation, computed on the last business day of the previous week, and

    (ii) The offering side evaluation, computed as of the last business day of the previous week, is more than one-half of one percent ($5.00 on a unit representing $1,000 principal amount of eligible trust securities) greater than the current offering price.

    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions above, any registered separate account offering variable annuity contracts, any person designated in such account's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in such contracts, and any principal underwriter of or dealer in such contracts shall be permitted to apply the initial purchase payment for any such contract at a price based on the current net asset value of such contract which is next computed:

    (1) Not later than two business days after receipt of the order to purchase by the insurance company sponsoring the separate account (“insurer”), if the contract application and other information necessary for processing the order to purchase (collectively, “application”) are complete upon receipt; or

    (2) Not later than two business days after an application which is incomplete upon receipt by the insurer is made complete,  That, if an incomplete application is not made complete within five business days after receipt,

    (i) The prospective purchaser shall be informed of the reasons for the delay, and

    (ii) The initial purchase payment shall be returned immediately and in full, unless the prospective purchaser specifically consents to the insurer retaining the purchase payment until the application is made complete.

    (3) As used in this section:

    (i)  shall mean either an individual contractowner or an individual participant in a group contract.

    (ii)  shall refer to the first purchase payment submitted to the insurer by, or on behalf of, a prospective purchaser.

    (d) The board of directors shall initially set the time or times during the day that the current net asset value shall be computed, and shall make and approve such changes as the board deems necessary.

    § 270.22c-2   Redemption fees for redeemable securities.

#### § § 270.22c-2

    (a)  It is unlawful for any fund issuing redeemable securities, its principal underwriter, or any dealer in such securities, to redeem a redeemable security issued by the fund within seven calendar days after the security was purchased, unless it complies with the following requirements:

    (1)  The fund's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund, must either:

    (ii) Determine that imposition of a redemption fee is either not necessary or not appropriate.

    (2)  With respect to each financial intermediary that submits orders, itself or through its agent, to purchase or redeem shares directly to the fund, its principal underwriter or transfer agent, or to a registered clearing agency, the fund (or on the fund's behalf, the principal underwriter or transfer agent) must either:

    (ii) Execute any instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges of fund shares by a shareholder who has been identified by the fund as having engaged in transactions of fund shares (directly or indirectly through the intermediary's account) that violate policies established by the fund for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding securities issued by the fund; and

    (iii) Use best efforts to determine, promptly upon request of the fund, whether any specific person about whom it has received the identification and transaction information set forth in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, is itself a financial intermediary (“indirect intermediary”) and, upon further request by the fund:

    (12)  means any investment that the fund reasonably expects to be convertible into cash in current market conditions in more than three calendar days but in seven calendar days or less, without the conversion to cash significantly changing the market value of the investment, as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (13)  means the fund or In-Kind ETF's investment adviser, officer, or officers (which may not be solely portfolio managers of the fund or In-Kind ETF) responsible for administering the program and its policies and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

    (b)  Each fund and In-Kind ETF must adopt and implement a written liquidity risk management program (“program”) that is reasonably designed to assess and manage its liquidity risk.

    (1)  The program must include policies and procedures reasonably designed to incorporate the following elements:

    (i)  Each fund and In-Kind ETF must assess, manage, and periodically review (with such review occurring no less frequently than annually) its liquidity risk, which must include consideration of the following factors, as applicable:

    (A) The fund or In-Kind ETF's investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio investments during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions, including whether the investment strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund, the extent to which the strategy involves a relatively concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular issuers, and the use of borrowings for investment purposes and derivatives;

    (B) Short-term and long-term cash flow projections during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions;

    (C) Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other funding sources; and

    (D) For an ETF:

    () The relationship between the ETF's portfolio liquidity and the way in which, and the prices and spreads at which, ETF shares trade, including, the efficiency of the arbitrage function and the level of active participation by market participants (including authorized participants); and

    () The effect of the composition of baskets on the overall liquidity of the ETF's portfolio.

    (ii)  Each fund must, using information obtained after reasonable inquiry and taking into account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, classify each of the fund's portfolio investments (including each of the fund's derivatives transactions) as a highly liquid investment, moderately liquid investment, less liquid investment, or illiquid investment. A fund must review its portfolio investments' classifications, at least monthly in connection with reporting the liquidity classification for each portfolio investment on Form N-PORT in accordance with § 270.30b1-9, and more frequently if changes in relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations are reasonably expected to materially affect one or more of its investments' classifications.

    (A) The fund may generally classify and review its portfolio investments (including the fund's derivatives transactions) according to their asset class, provided, however, that the fund must separately classify and review any investment within an asset class if the fund or its adviser has information about any market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of that investment as compared to the fund's other portfolio holdings within that asset class.

    (B) In classifying and reviewing its portfolio investments or asset classes (as applicable), the fund must determine whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio investment or asset class, in sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably expected to significantly affect its liquidity, and if so, the fund must take this determination into account when classifying the liquidity of that investment or asset class.

    (C) For derivatives transactions that the fund has classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, identify the percentage of the fund's highly liquid investments that it has pledged as margin or collateral in connection with derivatives transactions in each of these classification categories.

    (iii)  (A) Any fund that does not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments must:

    () Determine a highly liquid investment minimum, considering the factors specified in paragraphs (b)(_1_)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, as applicable (but considering those factors specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) only as they apply during normal conditions, and during stressed conditions only to the extent they are reasonably foreseeable during the period until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum). The highly liquid investment minimum determined pursuant to this paragraph may not be changed during any period of time that a fund's assets that are highly liquid investments are below the determined minimum without approval from the fund's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund;

    () Periodically review, no less frequently than annually, the highly liquid investment minimum; and

    () Adopt and implement policies and procedures for responding to a shortfall of the fund's highly liquid investments below its highly liquid investment minimum, which must include requiring the person(s) designated to administer the program to report to the fund's board of directors no later than its next regularly scheduled meeting with a brief explanation of the causes of the shortfall, the extent of the shortfall, and any actions taken in response, and if the shortfall lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days, must include requiring the person(s) designated to administer the program to report to the board within one business day thereafter with an explanation of how the fund plans to restore its minimum within a reasonable period of time.

    (B) For purposes of determining whether a fund primarily holds assets that are highly liquid investments, a fund must exclude from its calculations the percentage of the fund's assets that are highly liquid investments that it has pledged as margin or collateral in connection with derivatives transactions that the fund has classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.

    (iv)  No fund or In-Kind ETF may acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund or In-Kind ETF would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets. If a fund or In-Kind ETF holds more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets:

    (A) It must cause the person(s) designated to administer the program to report such an occurrence to the fund's or In-Kind ETF's board of directors within one business day of the occurrence, with an explanation of the extent and causes of the occurrence, and how the fund or In-Kind ETF plans to bring its illiquid investments that are assets to or below 15% of its net assets within a reasonable period of time; and

    (B) If the amount of the fund's or In-Kind ETF's illiquid investments that are assets is still above 15% of its net assets 30 days from the occurrence (and at each consecutive 30 day period thereafter), the fund or In-Kind ETF's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund or In-Kind ETF, must assess whether the plan presented to it pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) continues to be in the best interest of the fund or In-Kind ETF.

    (v)  A fund that engages in, or reserves the right to engage in, redemptions in kind and any In-Kind ETF must establish policies and procedures regarding how and when it will engage in such redemptions in kind.

    (2)  A fund or In-Kind ETF's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund or In-Kind ETF, must:

    (i) Initially approve the liquidity risk management program;

    (ii) Approve the designation of the person(s) designated to administer the program; and

    (iii) Review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by the person(s) designated to administer the program that addresses the operation of the program and assesses its adequacy and effectiveness of implementation, including, if applicable, the operation of the highly liquid investment minimum, and any material changes to the program.

    (3)  The fund or In-Kind ETF must maintain:

    (i) A written copy of the program and any associated policies and procedures adopted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(2) of this section that are in effect, or at any time within the past five years were in effect, in an easily accessible place;

    (ii) Copies of any materials provided to the board of directors in connection with its approval under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and materials provided to the board of directors under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the documents were provided, the first two years in an easily accessible place; and

    (iii) If applicable, a written record of the policies and procedures related to how the highly liquid investment minimum, and any adjustments thereto, were determined, including assessment of the factors incorporated in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (B) of this section and any materials provided to the board pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A)() of this section, for a period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) following the determination of, and each change to, the highly liquid investment minimum.

    (c)  On or before the date of initial deposit of portfolio securities into a registered UIT, the UIT's principal underwriter or depositor must determine that the portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues, and must maintain a record of that determination for the life of the UIT and for five years thereafter.

    (4) The seller of the security is not to the knowledge of the issuer an affiliated person of the issuer.

    (5) Payment of the purchase price is accompanied or preceded by a written confirmation of the purchase.

    (6) The purchase is made at a price not above the market value, if any, or the asset value of such security, whichever is lower, at the time of such purchase.

Before each repurchase offer, the repurchase offer amount for that repurchase offer shall be determined by the directors of the company.

    (A) If the repurchase would cause the company to lose its status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 851-860];

    (B) If the repurchase would cause the stock that is the subject of the offer that is either listed on a national securities exchange or quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association to be neither listed on any national securities exchange nor quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association;

    (C) For any period during which the New York Stock Exchange or any other market in which the securities owned by the company are principally traded is closed, other than customary week-end and holiday closings, or during which trading in such market is restricted;

    (B) Any fees applicable to such repurchase;

    (iii) For purposes of sending a notification to a beneficial owner pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, where the company knows that shares of common stock that is the subject of a repurchase offer are held of record by a broker, dealer, voting trustee, bank, association or other entity that exercises fiduciary powers in nominee name or otherwise, the company shall follow the procedures for transmitting materials to beneficial owners of securities that are set forth in § 240.14a-13 of this chapter.

    (5) If security holders tender more than the repurchase offer amount, the company may repurchase an additional amount of stock not to exceed two percent of the common stock outstanding on the repurchase request deadline. If the company determines not to repurchase more than the repurchase offer amount, or if security holders tender stock in an amount exceeding the repurchase offer amount plus two percent of the common stock outstanding on the repurchase request deadline, the company shall repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis;  That this provision shall not prohibit the company from:

    (i) Accepting all stock tendered by persons who own, beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than a specified number which is less than one hundred shares and who tender all of their stock, before prorating stock tendered by others; or

    (ii) Accepting by lot stock tendered by security holders who tender all stock held by them and who, when tendering their stock, elect to have either all or none or at least a minimum amount or none accepted, if the company first accepts all stock tendered by security holders who do not so elect.

    (6) The company shall permit tenders of stock for repurchase to be withdrawn or modified at any time until the repurchase request deadline but shall not permit tenders to be withdrawn or modified thereafter.

During any period when the company is offering its common stock, the current net asset value of the common stock shall be computed no less frequently than once daily, Monday through Friday, at the specific time or times during the day that the board of directors of the company shall set, except on:

    (A) Days on which changes in the value of the company's portfolio securities will not materially affect the current net asset value of the common stock;

    (B) Days during which no order to purchase its common stock is received, other than days when the net asset value would otherwise be computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; or

    (C) Customary national, local, and regional business holidays described or listed in the prospectus.

    (ii) In the event that the company's assets fail to comply with the requirements in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, the board of directors shall cause the company to take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure compliance.

    (iii) In supervising the company's operations and portfolio management by the investment adviser, the company's board of directors shall adopt written procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the company's investment objectives, to ensure that the company's portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid so that the company can comply with its fundamental policy on repurchases, and comply with the liquidity requirements of paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. The board of directors shall review the overall composition of the portfolio and make and approve such changes to the procedures as the board deems necessary.

    (11) The company, or any underwriter for the company, shall comply, as if the company were an open-end company, with the provisions of section 24(b) [15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)] and rules issued thereunder with respect to any advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to prospective investors.

    (d)  A company that makes repurchase offers pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall not be deemed thereby to be an issuer of redeemable securities within section 2(a)(32) [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(32)].

    (e)  A company that makes repurchase offers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities pursuant to Section 24(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(f)) upon the effective date of its registration statement.

    § 270.24f-2   Registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of certain investment company securities.

#### § § 270.24f-2

    (a)  Any face-amount certificate company, open-end management company, closed-end management company that makes periodic repurchase offers pursuant to § 270.23c-3(b), or unit investment trust (“issuer”) that is deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities pursuant to Section 24(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(f)) must not later than 90 days after the end of any fiscal year during which it has publicly offered such securities, file Form 24F-2 (17 CFR 274.24) with the Commission.  Form 24F-2 must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of that form, and must be accompanied by the payment of a registration fee with respect to the securities sold during the fiscal year in reliance upon registration pursuant to section 24(f) of the Act calculated in the manner specified in section 24(f) of the Act and in the Form. An issuer that pays the registration fee more than 90 days after the end of its fiscal year must pay interest in the manner specified in section 24(f) of the Act and in Form 24F-2.

    (b)  For purposes of this section, if an issuer ceases operations, the date the issuer ceases operations will be deemed to be the end of its fiscal year. In the case of a liquidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets (“merger”) of the issuer, the issuer will be deemed to have ceased operations for the purposes of this section on the date the merger is consummated;  that in the case of a merger of an issuer or a series of an issuer (“Predecessor Issuer”) with another issuer or a series of an issuer (“Successor Issuer”), the Predecessor Issuer will not be deemed to have ceased operations and the Successor issuer will assume the obligations, fees, and redemption credits of the Predecessor Issuer incurred pursuant to section 24(f) of the Act and § 270.24e-2 (as in effect prior to October 11, 1997; see 17 CFR part 240 to end, revised as of April 1, 1997) if the Successor Issuer:

    (1) had no assets or liabilities, other than nominal assets or liabilities, and no operating history immediately prior to the merger;

    (2) Acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities and obligations of the Predecessor Issuer; and

    (3) The merger is not designed to result in the Predecessor Issuer merging with, or substantially all of its assets being acquired by, an issuer (or a series of an issuer) that would not meet the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (c)  To determine the date on which Form 24F-2 must be filed with the Commission under paragraph (a) of this section, the first day of the 90-day period is the first calendar day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the Form is to be filed. If the last day of the 90-day period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the period ends on the first business day thereafter.

#### § § 270.27d-1

    (a)(1) Every depositor of or principal underwriter for the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate sold subject to section 27(d) or section 27(f) of the Act or both, shall deposit and maintain funds in a segregated trust account as a reserve and as security for the purpose of assuring the refund of charges required by sections 27(d) and 27(f) of the Act.

    (2) The assets of such trust account may be held as cash or invested only in one or more of (i) government securities as defined in section 2(a)(16) of the Act (except equity securities) or (ii) negotiable certificates of deposit issued by a bank, as defined in section 2(a)(5) of the Act and having capital and surplus of at least $10 million:  That no such investment may have a maturity of more than 5 years, no more than 50 percent of the assets may be invested in obligations having a maturity of more than 1 year, and certificates of deposit of a single issuer may not constitute more than 10 percent of the value of the assets in the account.

    (3) Any income, gains, or losses from assets allocated to such account, whether or not realized, shall be credited to or charged against such account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of the depositor or principal underwriter.

    (4) The assets of such trust account may be withdrawn only as permitted by paragraph (f) of this section and shall in no event be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any aspect of the business of the depositor or principal underwriter other than assuring the ability of the depositor or principal underwriter to refund the amounts required by such sections.

    (b) For purposes of this section:

    (1) “Excess sales load” on any payment is that portion of the sales load in excess of 15 percent of that payment.

    (2) “Monthly payment” shall be the amount of the smallest monthly installment scheduled to be paid during the life of the plan. If payments are required or permitted to be made on a basis less frequently than monthly, an equivalent monthly payment shall be the amount determined by dividing the smallest minimum payment required or permitted in a payment period by the number of months included in such period.

    (3) The assets in the segregated trust account shall be valued as follows: (i) With respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities, fair value as determined in good faith by the depositor or principal underwriter.

    (c) For every periodic payment plan certificate governed by section 27(d), the depositor or principal underwriter shall deposit into the segregated trust account not less than 45 percent of the excess sales load on each of the first six monthly payments or their equivalent.

    (d) For all periodic payment plan certificates governed by section 27(d) which have not been surrendered in accordance with their terms, and for which the depositor or principal underwriter may be liable for the refund of any sales load, the depositor or principal underwriter shall maintain in the segregated trust account an amount equal to not less than 15% of the total refundable sales load on the payments made on those certificates. The depositor or principal underwriter shall also maintain in the segregated trust account such additional amounts as the Commission by order may require for the depositor or principal underwriter to carry out refund obligations pursuant to sections 27(d) and 27(f) of the Act.

    (e) For every periodic payment plan certificate governed by section 27(f) of the Act, and for which the depositor or principal underwriter has no obligation to refund any excess sales load pursuant to section 27(d) of the Act, the depositor or principal underwriter shall deposit and maintain during the refund period, at least the following amounts in the segregated trust account:

    (1) For certificates that require monthly payments of $100 or less, 20 percent of the difference between the gross payments made and the net amount invested;

    (2) For certificates that require monthly payments in excess of $100 and for single payment plan certificates, 30 percent of the difference between the gross payments made and the net amount invested;

    (3) For certificates with respect to which the holder is entitled to receive the greater of the refund provided by section 27(f) (of the Act) or a refund of total payments and upon which a total of at least $1,000 has been paid, 100 percent of the difference between the gross payments made and net amount invested; and

    (4) Such additional amounts as the Commission by order may require to carry out the obligation to refund charges pursuant to section 27(f) of the Act.

    (f) Assets may be withdrawn from the segregated trust account by each depositor or principal underwriter:

    (1) To refund excess sales load to a certificate holder exercising the right of surrender specified in section 27(d) of the Act; or

    (2) To refund to a certificate holder exercising the right of withdrawal specified in section 27(f) of the Act the difference between the amount of his gross payments and the net amount invested; or

    (3) For any other purpose:  That such withdrawal shall not reduce the segregated trust account to an amount less than the sum of (i) 130 percent of the amount required to be maintained by paragraph (d) of this section, if any, and (ii) 100 percent of that amount required to be maintained by paragraph (e) of this section, if any.

    (g) The minimum amounts required to be maintained by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be computed at least monthly. Any additional deposits required by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section shall be made immediately after such computation, and any withdrawals permitted by paragraph (f)(3) of this section may be made only at such time.

    (h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a depositor or principal underwriter, acting as such for two or more registered investment companies issuing periodic payment plan certificates, from combining in a single segregated trust account the reserves for such companies required by this section.

    (i) The refunds required to be made to certificate holders pursuant to sections 27(d) and 27(f) (of the Act) shall be paid in cash not more than 7 days from the date the certificate is received in proper form by the custodian bank or such other paying agent as may be designated under the periodic payment plan.

    (j) Each depositor or principal underwriter shall file with the Commission, within the appropriate period of time specified, an Accounting of Segregated Trust Account. Form N-27D-1 (§ 274.127d-1 of this chapter) is hereby prescribed as such accounting form.

    § 270.35d-1   Investment company names.

#### § § 270.35d-1

    (a)  For purposes of section 35(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-34(d)), a materially deceptive and misleading name of a fund includes:

    (1)  A name suggesting that the fund or the securities issued by it are guaranteed, sponsored, recommended, or approved by the United States Government or any United States Government agency or instrumentality, including any name that uses the words “guaranteed” or “insured” or similar terms in conjunction with the words “United States” or “U.S. Government.”

    (2)  A name that includes terms suggesting that the fund focuses its investments in: a particular type of investment or investments; a particular industry or group of industries; particular countries or geographic regions; or investments that have, or whose issuers have, particular characteristics ( a name with terms such as “growth” or “value,” or terms indicating that the fund's investment decisions incorporate one or more environmental, social, or governance factors), unless:

    (i) The fund has adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its assets in investments in accordance with the investment focus that the fund's name suggests. For a name suggesting that the fund focuses its investments in a particular country or geographic region, investments that are in accordance with the investment focus that the fund's name suggests are investments that are tied economically to the particular country or geographic region suggested by its name;

    (ii) The policy described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is a fundamental policy, or the fund has adopted a policy to provide the fund's shareholders with at least 60 days' prior notice of any change in the policy described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and any change in the fund's name that accompanies the change, that meets the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section; and

    (iii) Any terms used in the fund's name that suggest that the fund focuses its investments as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are consistent with those terms' plain English meaning or established industry use.

    (3)  A name suggesting that the fund's distributions are exempt from Federal income tax or from both Federal and State income tax, unless:

    (i) The fund has adopted a fundamental policy:

    (A) To invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its assets in investments the income from which is exempt, as applicable, from Federal income tax or from both Federal and State income tax; or

    (B) To invest, under normal circumstances, its assets so that at least 80% of the income that it distributes will be exempt, as applicable, from Federal income tax or from both Federal and State income tax; and

    (ii) Any terms used in the fund's name that suggest that the fund invests its assets as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section are consistent with those terms' plain English meaning or established industry use.

    (b)  (1) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i) of this section apply at the time a fund invests its assets, provided that:

    (i) The fund must review its portfolio investments' inclusion in the fund's 80% basket, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, at least quarterly. If, subsequent to an investment, the fund identifies that the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, as applicable, are no longer met, the fund must make future investments in a manner that will bring the fund into compliance with those paragraphs as soon as reasonably practicable, and in all circumstances within 90 consecutive days of the fund's identification that those requirements are no longer met;

    (ii) If the fund departs from the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, as applicable, in other-than-normal circumstances, the fund must come back into compliance with the requirements of those paragraphs within 90 consecutive days, measured from the time of the initial departure; and

    (iii) A fund may temporarily invest less than 80% of the value of its assets in accordance with the fund's investment focus as otherwise required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, as applicable, to reposition or liquidate the fund's assets in connection with a reorganization, to launch the fund, or when notice of a change in a fund's policy as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section has been provided to fund shareholders.

    (2) For the purpose of determining the fund's compliance with an investment policy adopted under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, in addition to any derivatives instrument that the fund includes in its 80% basket because the derivatives instrument provides investment exposure to investments suggested by the fund's name, a fund may include in its 80% basket a derivatives instrument that provides investment exposure to one or more of the market risk factors associated with the investment focus that the fund's name suggests.

    (3) A fund must maintain written records documenting its compliance under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable. A fund must maintain written records, at the time a fund invests its assets, documenting: whether the investment the fund makes is included in the fund's 80% basket and, if so, the basis for including such investment in the fund's 80% basket; and the value of the fund's 80% basket, as a percentage of the value of the fund's assets. A fund must maintain written records documenting its review of its portfolio investments' inclusion in the fund's 80% basket, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, including whether each investment is included in the fund's 80% basket and the basis for including such investment in the 80% basket. If during the review of portfolio investments' inclusion in the fund's 80% basket or otherwise, the fund identifies that the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, as applicable, are no longer met, the fund must maintain written records documenting: the date this was identified; and the reason for any departure from the policies described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i) of this section. If the fund departs from the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section, as applicable, in other-than-normal circumstances as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, or as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the fund must keep records documenting: the date of any departure from the policies described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i) of this section; and the reason for any such departure (including why the fund determined that circumstances are other-than-normal). A fund must maintain records of any notice sent to the fund's shareholders pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Written records documenting the fund's compliance under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be maintained for a period of not less than six years following the creation of each required record (or, in the case of notices, following the date the notice was sent), the first two years in an easily accessible place.

    (c)  A fund name may be materially deceptive or misleading under section 35(d) of the Act even if the fund adopts and implements a policy under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section and otherwise complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, as applicable.

    (d)  A policy to provide a fund's shareholders with notice of a change in a fund's policy as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must provide that:

    (1) The notice will be provided in plain English separately from any other documents (provided, however, that if the notice is delivered in paper form, it may be provided in the same envelope as other written documents);

    (2) The notice will contain the following prominent statement, or similar clear and understandable statement, in bold-face type: “Important Notice Regarding Change in Investment Policy [and Name]”, provided that:

    (i) If the notice is provided in paper form, the statement also will appear on the envelope in which the notice is delivered; and

    (ii) If the notice is provided electronically, the statement also will appear on the subject line of the email communication that includes the notice or an equivalent indication of the subject of the communication in other forms of electronic media; and

    (3) The notice must describe, as applicable, the fund's policy adopted under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the nature of the change to the policy, the fund's old and new names, and the effective date of any policy and/or name changes.

    (e)  The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(3)(i), and (b)(3) of this section shall apply to any unit investment trust (as defined in section 4(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-4(2)) only at the time of initial deposit of portfolio securities.

    (f)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if the fund is a closed-end company or business development company, and the fund does not have shares that are listed on a national securities exchange, any policy adopted pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section can be changed only if authorized by the vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of such fund unless:

    (1) The fund conducts a tender or repurchase offer to allow shareholders to redeem shares, in accordance with all applicable Commission rules, in advance of any change in such policy;

    (2) The fund provides the fund's shareholders with at least 60 days' prior notice of any change in such policy in advance of the tender or repurchase offer described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section;

    (3) The tender or repurchase offer described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is not oversubscribed; and

    (4) In the event of a tender offer, the fund purchases shares at their net asset value.

    (g)  For purposes of this section:

    means net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes. In determining the value of a fund's assets for purposes of this section, a fund must value each derivatives instrument using the instrument's notional amount (which must be converted to 10-year bond equivalents for interest rate derivatives and delta adjusted for options contracts) and must value each physical short position using the value of the asset sold short. The fund may reduce the value of its assets by excluding any cash and cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of one year or less, up to the notional amount of the derivatives instrument(s) and the value of asset(s) sold short, and also exclude any closed-out derivatives positions if those positions result in no credit or market exposure to the fund. A fund must exclude from this calculation derivatives instruments used to hedge currency risks associated with one or more specific foreign-currency-denominated equity or fixed-income investments held by the fund, provided that such currency derivatives are entered into and maintained by the fund for hedging purposes and that the notional amounts of such derivatives do not exceed the value of the hedged investments (or the par value thereof, in the case of fixed-income investments) by more than 10 percent.

    means any swap, security-based swap, futures contract, forward contract, option, any combination of the foregoing, or any similar instrument.

    means investments that are invested in accordance with the investment focus that the fund's name suggests (or as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section).

    means a registered investment company or a business development company, including any separate series thereof.

    means a policy that a fund adopts under section 8(b)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(b)(3)) or, in the case of a business development company, a policy that is changeable only if authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund.

    means a period, not to exceed 180 consecutive days, starting from the date the fund commences operations.

    means shareholders have tendered or requested repurchase of a greater number of shares than the fund has offered to purchase in accordance with applicable Commission rules.

    (2)  To request a temporary hardship exemption, you must:

    (i) File Form ADV-H (17 CFR 279.3) in paper format with no later than one business day after the filing that is the subject of the ADV-H was due; and

    (ii) Submit the filing that is the subject of the Form ADV-H in electronic format with the IARD no later than seven business days after the filing was due.

    (3)  The temporary hardship exemption will be granted when you file a completed Form ADV-H.

    (3)  You are not exempt from the electronic filing requirements until and unless the Commission approves your application. If the Commission approves your application, you may submit your filings to FINRA in paper format for the period of time for which the exemption is granted.

    (4)  Your application will be granted only if you are able to demonstrate that the electronic filing requirements of this chapter are prohibitively burdensome or expensive.

    (5)  You are a “small business” for purposes of this section if you are required to answer Item 12 of Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1) and checked “no” to each question in Item 12 that you were required to answer.

    (3) In determining the aggregate value of assets of plans, include only that portion of a plan's assets for which the investment adviser provided investment advice (including any advice with respect to the selection of an investment adviser to manage such assets).

    (2) Indicates on Schedule D of its Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1) that it will withdraw from registration with the Commission if, on the 120th day after the date the investment adviser's registration with the Commission becomes effective, the investment adviser would be prohibited by section 203A(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-3a(a)) from registering with the Commission; and

    (3) Notwithstanding § 275.203A-1(b)(2) of this chapter, files a completed Form ADV-W (17 CFR 279.2) withdrawing from registration with the Commission within 120 days after the date the investment adviser's registration with the Commission becomes effective.

    (d)  An investment adviser that:

    (1) Upon submission of its application for registration with the Commission, is required by the laws of 15 or more States to register as an investment adviser with the state securities authority in the respective States, and thereafter would, but for this section, be required by the laws of at least 15 States to register as an investment adviser with the state securities authority in the respective States;

    (2) Elects to rely on paragraph (d) of this section by:

    (3) Maintains in an easily accessible place a record of the States in which the investment adviser has determined it would, but for the exemption, be required to register for a period of not less than five years from the filing of a Form ADV that includes a representation that is based on such record.

    (e)  (1) An investment adviser that:

    (i) Provides investment advice to all of its clients exclusively through an operational interactive website at all times during which the investment adviser relies on this paragraph (e);

    (ii) Maintains, in an easily accessible place, for a period of not less than five years from the filing of a Form ADV that includes a representation that the adviser is eligible to register with the Commission under this paragraph (e), a record demonstrating that it provides investment advice to its clients exclusively through an operational interactive website in accordance with the limits in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section; and

    (iii) Does not control, is not controlled by, and is not under common control with, another investment adviser that registers with the Commission under paragraph (b) of this section solely in reliance on the adviser registered under this paragraph (e) as its registered adviser.

    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (e), “operational interactive website” means a website, mobile application, or similar digital platform through which the investment adviser provides digital investment advisory services on an ongoing basis to more than one client (except during temporary technological outages of a  duration).

    (2)  The prohibitions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to an investment adviser as a result of a contribution made by a natural person more than six months prior to becoming a covered associate of the investment adviser unless such person, after becoming a covered associate, solicits clients on behalf of the investment adviser.

    (3)  (i) An investment adviser that is prohibited from providing investment advisory services for compensation pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section as a result of a contribution made by a covered associate of the investment adviser is excepted from such prohibition, subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section, upon satisfaction of the following requirements:

    (c)  For purposes of this section, an investment adviser to a covered investment pool in which a government entity invests or is solicited to invest shall be treated as though that investment adviser were providing or seeking to provide investment advisory services directly to the government entity.

    (d)  As a means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts, practices, or courses of business within the meaning of section 206(4) of Advisers Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-6(4)), it shall be unlawful for any investment adviser registered (or required to be registered) with the Commission, or unregistered in reliance on the exemption available under section 203(b)(3) of the Advisers Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(b)(3)), or that is an exempt reporting adviser, or any of the investment adviser's covered associates to do anything indirectly which, if done directly, would result in a violation of this section.

      § 300.102   Accounts held by executors, administrators, guardians, etc.

#### § § 300.102

      (a) Accounts held with a member in the name of a decedent or in the name of his estate or in the name of the executor or administrator of the estate of the decedent shall be combined so as to constitute a single account of a separate customer.

#### § § 300.103

      (c) All qualifying joint accounts with a member owned by the same persons shall be deemed held by the same customer so that the maximum protection afforded to such accounts in the aggregate shall be the protection afforded to one separate customer of the member

      (d) A joint account with a member which does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this rule shall be deemed to be an individual or qualifying joint account of the co-owner or co-owners having the exclusive power to act with respect to it.

      (1) Arises from a transaction in which a customer (as defined in § 300.300) of the other broker or dealer had an interest. For the purposes of this rule a customer is deemed to have an interest in a transaction if (i) the other broker was acting as agent for the customer or (ii) the other dealer was not a market maker in the security involved, to the extent such other dealer held a firm order from the customer and in connection therewith: In the case of a buy order, prior to executing such customer's order purchased as principal the same number of shares or purchased shares to accumulate the number of shares necessary to complete the order; or in the case of a sell order, prior to executing such customer's order sold the same number of shares or a portion thereof; and

      (i) The open contractual commitment arose out of a transaction in which his customer had such an interest, and

      (ii) In the case of a failed to deliver of the debtor, as of the filing date such broker's or dealer's customer's interest had not been sold to such broker or dealer; or

      (2) In the case of a broker or dealer who maintains his records other than on a specific identification basis, he has determined that a customer had such an interest in a manner consistent with that used by such broker or dealer prior to the filing date to allocate fails to receive and fails to deliver in computing the special reserve bank account requirement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.15c3-3); or

      (3) In the case of a broker or dealer not described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, he has made the determination in a manner which the trustee finds to be fair and equitable.

      (2) At the option of the trustee by the delivery of securities against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price against the receipt of the securities at any time within 30 calendar days after settlement date unless the commitment previously has been bought-in or sold-out in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

      (3) In the event of the refusal of the other broker or dealer to accept completion of an open contractual commitment in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the failure of the other broker or dealer to promptly buy-in or sell-out a commitment in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or in the event of the failure of the other broker or dealer to provide the trustee with appropriate documentation as required by § 300.303, by delivery of securities against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price against receipt of securities, or the buy-in or sell-out of the commitment or cancellation of the commitment or otherwise, as may be appropriate, as the trustee in his discretion will most benefit the estate of the debtor.

      (b) In the event of a close-out of an open contractual commitment pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the money differences resulting from such close-out shall be payable by the other broker or dealer to the trustee or by the trustee to the other broker or dealer, whichever would be entitled to receive such difference under the usual trade practices:  (1) That prior to the payment of any such money difference by the trustee to such other broker or dealer with respect to transactions executed by such other broker or dealer for any separate customer account, all open contractual commitments with respect to such account which meet the requirements of § 300.301 must have been completed by delivery of securities against receipt of the contract price or by payment of the contract price against receipt of the securities in conformity with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by buy-in or sell-out in conformity with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and (2) that the net amount so payable by the trustee to the other broker or dealer shall not exceed $40,000 with respect to any separate customer account.

      § 300.304   Retained rights of brokers or dealers.

#### § § 300.304

#### § § 300.305

      Notwithstanding the fact that an open contractual commitment described in § 300.300(c) meets the requirements of § 300.301 and the other requirements of these rules, a court shall not be precluded from canceling such commitment, awarding damages, or granting such other remedy as it shall deem fair and equitable if, on application of the trustee or SIPC, it determines that such commitment was not entered into in the ordinary course of business or was entered into by the debtor, or the broker or dealer or his customer, for the purposes of creating a commitment in contemplation of a liquidation proceeding under the Act. Such a determination shall be made after notice and opportunity for hearing by the debtor, such broker or dealer, or such customer, and may be made before or after the delivery of securities or payment of the contract price or before or after any buy-in or sell-out of the open contractual commitment, or otherwise.

      § 300.306   Completion or closeout pursuant to SIPC direction.

#### § § 300.306

      In its discretion SIPC may, in order to prevent a substantial detrimental impact upon the finanical condition of one or more brokers or dealers, direct the closeout or completion of an open contractual commitment, irrespective of whether it is described in § 300.300(c) or meets the requirements of § 300.301 or has been reported in conformity with § 300.303 or is supported by appropriate documentation. SIPC shall consult with the Securities and Exchange Commission before SIPC makes any determinations under this section.

      § 300.307   Completion with cash or securities of customer.

#### § § 300.307

      The trustee may, if authorized by the court, complete an open contractual commitment of the debtor, regardless of whether it is described in § 300.300(c) or meets the requirements of § 300.301 or has been reported to the trustee in conformity with § 300.303, to the extent that such commitment is completed with customer name securities of the customer of the debtor for whose account the commitment was made, or with cash or securities paid or delivered by or for the account of such customer to the debtor or trustee after the filing date.

      § 300.400   Satisfaction of customer claims for standardized options.

      (c) A trustee in a liquidation proceeding, or SIPC in a direct payment procedure, shall calculate the dollar amount of all Standardized Options positions held for the account of a customer in accordance with section 16(11) of the Act, and credit or debit, as appropriate, the dollar amount so calculated to the account of such customer.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, neither the trustee in a liquidation proceeding nor SIPC in a direct payment procedure shall be required under this rule to liquidate any short position in Standardized Options covered by the deposit of (1) the underlying securities, in the case of a call option, or (2) treasury bills, in the case of a put option, by or on behalf of a customer with a bank or other depository. Any such positions that are not liquidated shall be excluded from the calculation provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (e) In no event will Standardized Options positions be delivered to or on behalf of customers in satisfaction of claims pursuant to section 7(b)(1) of the Act except to the extent that such positions have been transferred as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (f) In no event will Standardized Options be purchased for delivery to customers pursuant to section 8(d) of the Act.

#### § § 302.103

    The Corporation, as receiver for one or more covered brokers or dealers or in anticipation of being appointed receiver for one or more covered broker or dealers, may organize one or more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered broker or dealer.

    (b) If the Corporation establishes one or more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered broker or dealer, then, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation as receiver for such covered broker or dealer shall transfer all customer accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property to such bridge brokers or dealers unless the Corporation determines, after consultation with the Commission and SIPC, that:

    (1) The customer accounts, customer name securities, and customer property are likely to be promptly transferred to one or more qualified brokers or dealers such that the use of a bridge broker or dealer would not facilitate such transfer to one or more qualified brokers or dealers; or

    (2) The transfer of such customer accounts to a bridge broker or dealer would materially interfere with the ability of the Corporation to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on financial stability or economic conditions in the United States.

    (c) The Corporation, as receiver for such covered broker or dealer, also may transfer any other assets and liabilities of the covered broker or dealer (including non-customer accounts and any associated property and any assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody business) to such bridge brokers or dealers as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, 12 U.S.C. 5390(h), including 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(1) and 5390(h)(5), and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

Customer property transferred from the covered broker or dealer, along with advances from SIPC, shall be allocated to customer accounts at the bridge broker or dealer in accordance with § 302.104(a)(3). Such allocations initially may be based upon estimates, and such estimates may be based upon the books and records of the covered broker or dealer or any other information deemed relevant in the discretion of the Corporation, as receiver, in consultation with SIPC, as trustee. Such estimates may be adjusted from time to time as additional information becomes available. With respect to each account transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall undertake the obligations of a broker or dealer only with respect to property transferred to and held by the bridge broker or dealer, and allocated to the account as provided in § 302.104(a)(3), including any customer property and any advances from SIPC.

The transfer of customer property to such an account shall have no effect on calculation of the amount of the affected accountholder's net equity, but the value, as of the appointment date, of the customer property and advances from SIPC so transferred shall be deemed to satisfy any such claim, in whole or in part.

    (e) The transfer of assets or liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer, including customer accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property, assets and liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer for any non-customer creditor, and assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody business, to a bridge broker or dealer, shall be effective without any consent, authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer, contract party, governmental authority, or court.

    (f) Any succession to or assumption by a bridge broker or dealer of rights, powers, authorities, or privileges of a covered broker or dealer shall be effective without any consent, authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer, contract party, governmental authority, or court, and any such bridge broker or dealer shall upon its organization by the Corporation immediately and by operation of law—

    (1) Be established and deemed registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

    (2) Be deemed to be a member of SIPC; and

    (3) Succeed to any and all registrations and memberships of the covered broker or dealer with or in any self-regulatory organizations.

    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall be subject to applicable Federal securities laws and all requirements with respect to being a member of a self-regulatory organization and shall operate in accordance with all such laws and requirements and in accordance with its articles of association; provided, however, that the Commission may, in its discretion, exempt the bridge broker or dealer from any such requirements if the Commission deems such exemption to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

    (h) At the end of the term of existence of a bridge broker or dealer, any proceeds that remain after payment of all administrative expenses of such bridge broker or dealer and all other claims against such bridge broker or dealer shall be distributed to the receiver for the related covered broker or dealer.

SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, shall make claims determinations in accordance with SIPA and with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but such determinations, and any claims related thereto, shall be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (2) SIPC shall make advances in accordance with, and subject to the limitations imposed by, 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3. Where appropriate, SIPC shall make such advances by delivering cash or securities to the customer accounts established at the bridge broker or dealer.

    (i) First, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5385(f) and 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(c)(1), to the extent such advances effected the release of securities which then were apportioned to customer property pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff(d);

    (ii) Second, to customers of such covered broker or dealer, or in the case that customer accounts are transferred to a bridge broker or dealer, then to such customer accounts at a bridge broker or dealer, who shall share ratably in such customer property on the basis and to the extent of their respective net equities;

    (iii) Third, to SIPC as subrogee for the claims of customers; and

    (iv) Fourth, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(c)(2).

    (4) The determinations and advances made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer under §§ 302.100 through 302.107 shall be made in a manner consistent with SIPC's customary practices under SIPA. The allocation of customer property, advances from SIPC, and delivery of customer name securities to each customer or to its customer account at a bridge broker or dealer, in partial or complete satisfaction of such customer's net equity claims as of the close of business on the appointment date, shall be in a manner, including form and timing, and in an amount at least as beneficial to such customer as would have been the case had the covered broker or dealer been liquidated under SIPA. Any claims related to determinations made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer shall be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b)  Any claim shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)-(5) and the regulations promulgated by the Corporation thereunder, provided however, that—

    (1)  The notice of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for a covered broker or dealer shall also include notice of the appointment of SIPC as trustee. The Corporation as receiver shall coordinate with SIPC as trustee to post the notice on SIPC's public website in addition to the publication procedures set forth in 12 CFR 380.33.

    (2)  The Corporation as receiver shall consult with SIPC, as trustee, regarding a claim form and filing instructions with respect to claims against the Corporation as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, and such information shall be provided on SIPC's public website in addition to the Corporation's public website. Any such claim form shall contain a provision permitting a claimant to claim status as a customer of the broker or dealer, if applicable.

    (3)  The Corporation as receiver shall establish a claims bar date in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder by which date creditors of a covered broker or dealer, including all customers of the covered broker or dealer, shall present their claims, together with proof. The claims bar date for a covered broker or dealer shall be the date following the expiration of the six-month period beginning on the date a notice to creditors to file their claims is first published in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Any claim filed after the claims bar date shall be disallowed, and such disallowance shall be final, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, except that a claim filed after the claims bar date shall be considered by the receiver as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(ii) and any regulations promulgated thereunder. In accordance with section 8(a)(3) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(a)(3), any claim for net equity filed more than sixty days after the date the notice to creditors to file claims is first published need not be paid or satisfied in whole or in part out of customer property and, to the extent such claim is paid by funds advanced by SIPC, it shall be satisfied in cash or securities, or both, as SIPC, as trustee, determines is most economical to the receivership estate.

    (c)  The Corporation as receiver of a covered broker or dealer shall notify a claimant whether it allows or disallows the claim, or any portion of a claim or any claim of a security, preference, set-off, or priority, within the 180-day period set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day period may be extended by written agreement as provided therein) or within the 90-day period set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5)(B) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, whichever is applicable. In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Corporation, as receiver, shall issue the notice required by this paragraph (c), which shall utilize the determination made by SIPC, as trustee, in a manner consistent with SIPC's customary practices in a liquidation under SIPA, with respect to any claim for net equity or customer name securities. The process established herein for the determination, within the 180-day period set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day period may be extended by written agreement as provided therein), of claims by customers of a covered broker or dealer for customer property or customer name securities shall constitute the exclusive process for the determination of such claims, and any procedure for expedited relief established pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5) and any regulations promulgated thereunder shall be inapplicable to such claims.

    (d)  The claimant may seek a judicial determination of any claim disallowed, in whole or in part, by the Corporation as receiver, including any claim disallowed based upon any determination(s) of SIPC as trustee made pursuant to § 302.104(a), by the appropriate district or territorial court of the United States in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4) or (5), whichever is applicable, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

    (b) The term  shall not include advances from SIPC to satisfy customer claims for net equity.
