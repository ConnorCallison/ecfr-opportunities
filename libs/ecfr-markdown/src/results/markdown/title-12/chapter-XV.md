This section establishes the alternative criteria that a national bank among the second 50 largest insured banks may meet, which criteria is comparable to and consistent with the purposes of the eligible debt requirement established by section 5136A.

      (b)  A national bank satisfies the alternative criteria referenced in Section 5136A(a)(2)(E) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24a) and 12 CFR 5.39(g)(3) if the bank has a current long-term issuer credit rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization that is within the three highest investment grade rating categories used by the organization.

      (c)  A “long-term issuer credit rating” is a written opinion issued by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization of the bank's overall capacity and willingness to pay on a timely basis its unsecured, dollar-denominated financial obligations maturing in not less than one year.

      § 1511.2   Law governing rights and obligations of the Funding Corporation and Federal Reserve Banks; rights of any Person against the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks.

#### § § 1511.2

      (1) The rights and obligations of the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:

      (i) A Book-entry Funding Corporation Security or Security Entitlement; and

      (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Funding Corporation Securities; and

      (i) A Book-entry Funding Corporation Security or Security Entitlement; and

      (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Funding Corporation Securities.

      (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1511.4(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1511.4(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in § 1511.3.

      (c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 1511.1), then the law specified in paragraph (b) shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.

      § 1511.3   Law governing other interests.

#### § § 1511.3

      (a) To the extent not inconsistent with the regulations in this part, the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction governs:

      (1) The acquisition of a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary;

      (2) The rights and duties of the Securities Intermediary and Entitlement Holder arising out of a Security Entitlement;

      (3) Whether the Securities Intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a Security Entitlement;

      (4) Whether an Adverse Claim can be asserted against a Person who acquires a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary or a Person who purchases a Security Entitlement or interest therein from an Entitlement Holder; and

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest in a Security Entitlement.

      (b) The following rules determine a “Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction” for purposes of this section:

      (1) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.

      (2) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.

      (3) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the Entitlement Holder's account.

      (4) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the Entitlement Holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the Securities Intermediary.

      (c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the Person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.

      (d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 1511.1), then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Securities Account is a clearing corporation, and the Participant's interest in a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security is a Security Entitlement.

      § 1511.4   Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.

#### § § 1511.4

      (a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.

      (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.

      (c)(1) The Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, the Funding Corporation, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.

      (2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1511.2(b) or § 1511.3. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.

      § 1511.5   Obligations of Funding Corporation; no adverse claims.

#### § § 1511.5

      (a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1511.4(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 1511, the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security has been credited as the Person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor the Funding Corporation is liable to a Person asserting or having an Adverse Claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.

      (b) The obligation of the Funding Corporation to make payments of interest and principal with respect to Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:

      (1) Interest on Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.

      (2) Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest, as directed by the Participant. The principal of such Securities shall be paid using the proceeds of the noninterest bearing instruments maintained by the Funding Corporation for such purpose.

      § 1511.6   Authority of Federal Reserve Banks.

#### § § 1511.6

      (a) Each Federal Reserve Bank is hereby authorized as fiscal agent of the Funding Corporation to perform functions with respect to the issuance of Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities offered and sold by the Funding Corporation, in accordance with the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars; to service and maintain Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities in accounts established for such purposes; to make payments of principal and interest with respect to such Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities as directed by the Funding Corporation; to effect transfer of Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities between Participants' Securities Accounts as directed by the Participants; and to perform such other duties as fiscal agent as may be requested by the Funding Corporation.

      (b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not inconsistent with this Part, governing the details of its handling of Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities, Security Entitlements, and the operation of the Book-Entry System under this Part.

      § 1511.7   Liability of the Funding Corporation and Federal Reserve Banks.

#### § § 1511.7

      The Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks may rely on the information provided in a Transfer Message, or other documentation, and are not required to verify the information. The Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks shall not be liable for any action taken in accordance with the information set out in a Transfer Message, other documentation, or evidence submitted in support thereof.

      § 1511.8   Notice of attachment.

#### § § 1511.8

      The interest of a debtor in a Security Entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the Securities Intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except where a Security Entitlement is maintained in the name of a secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by legal process upon the secured party. The regulations in this part do not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.
