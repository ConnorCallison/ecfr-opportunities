                  "(b) The insured may be required to provide production records to determine the approved APH yield, if production records for the most recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual production are provided, the records must be continuous and contain at least the most recent crop year's actual yield.\n",
                  "(1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent of T or D-Yield).\n",
                  "(2) If acceptable production records containing information for only the most recent crop year are provided, the three T or D-Yields adjusted by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and calculate the approved APH yield.\n",
                  "(3) If acceptable production records containing information for only the two most recent crop years are provided, the two T or D-Yields adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.\n",
                  "(4) If acceptable production records containing information for only the three most recent crop years are provided, the three actual yields and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.\n",
                  "(5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple average of the actual yields.\n",
                  "(6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and unadjusted T or D-Yields.\n",
                  "(7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to their farming operations and who do not have available records for the added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields for the added land, practice, types or varieties that are based on adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.\n",
                  "(8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may be based on the producer's APH average yield prior to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.\n",
                  "(c) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of production reports for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.\n",
                  "(d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be entered in the database. The resulting average yield will be used to determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of FCIC.\n",
                  "(e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not provide acceptable production reports for at least the most recent crop year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.\n",
                  "(f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in the following situations:\n",
                  "(1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,\n",
                  "(2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance tables, and \n",
                  "(3) For perennial crops:\n",
                  "(i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;\n",
                  "(ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the production level;\n",
                  "(iii) If more than two percent of the trees or vines have been removed within the last two years; or\n",
                  "(iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average yield are requested by the insured.\n",
                  "(g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC has been performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in accordance with the crop insurance contract.\n",
                  "(h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master Yields are available. To qualify, the producer must have at least four recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify the authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master Yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the crop's production.\n",
                  "(i) FCIC may use any production report available under the provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not, involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the approved APH yield.\n\n\n"

                  "(i) Such person may not be involved in any function related to the Federal crop insurance program during the disqualification or ineligibility period (including the sale, service, adjustment, data transmission or storage, reinsurance, etc. of any crop insurance policy) or receive any monetary or non-monetary benefit from a program administered under the Act.\n",
                  "(ii) If the person is an agent or insurance agency, the producers may cancel their policies sold and serviced by the disqualified agent and rewrite the policy with another agent. If the producer does not cancel and rewrite the policy with another agent, the approved insurance provider must assign the policies to a different agent or agency to service during the period of disqualification or ineligibility. Policies that have been assigned to another agent or agency by the insurance provider will revert back to the disqualified agent or agency after the period of disqualification has ended provided all civil fines are paid in full and the producer does not cancel and rewrite the policy with a different agent or agency;\n",
                  "(iii) If the person is an approved insurance provider, the approved insurance provider shall not sell, or authorize to be sold, any new policies or may not renew, or authorize the renewal of, existing policies, as determined by FCIC, during the period of disqualification or ineligibility. Nothing in this provision affects the approved insurance provider's responsibilities with respect to the service of existing policies.\n",

                  "(6) If the total user fee exceeds the maximum amount determined by the Board, the maximum amount determined by the Board will be divided by the number of policies earning premium to determine the amount to be paid by each approved insurance provider.\n",
                  "(7) Reasonableness of the initial request to charge a user fee will be determined by the Board based on a comparison of the amount of reimbursement for maintenance previously received, the number of policies, the number of approved insurance providers, and the expected total amount of user fees to be received in any reinsurance year.\n",
                  "(8) A user fee unnecessarily inhibits the use of a policy or plan of insurance if it is so high that approved insurance providers will not sell the policy, or the user fee represents an unreasonable portion of the A&O subsidy paid to the AIP such that it prevents the AIP from meeting its other obligations under the SRA.\n",
                  "(9) The user fee charged to each approved insurance provider will be considered payment in full for the use of such policy, plan of insurance or rate of premium for the reinsurance year in which payment is made.\n",
                  "(10) It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to collect such fees from an approved insurance provider and any indebtedness for such fees must be resolved by the applicant and approved insurance provider.\n",

An NRS policy will be considered to disrupt the marketplace if RMA determines it encourages planting more acres of the insured commodity in excess of normal market demand, adversely affects the sales or administration of reinsured policies, undermines producers' confidence in the Federal crop insurance program, or harms public perception of the Federal crop insurance program.\n",

                  "(g) If you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, not eligible to obtain an SSN or EIN, whichever is required, you must request an assigned number for the purposes of this policy from us:\n",
                  "(1) A number will be provided only if you can demonstrate you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, eligible to receive Federal benefits;\n",

                  "(3) If a number cannot be provided for any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you in accordance with section 2(g)(1), the amount of coverage for all crops on the application will be reduced proportionately by the percentage interest of such person in you.\n",
                  "(h) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this policy for the initial crop year unless you choose to insure the entire crop under another Federally reinsured plan of insurance with the same insurance provider on or before the sales closing date. After the first year, the policy will continue in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled, voided or terminated as provided in this section.\n",
                  "(i) You may cancel this policy after the initial crop year by providing written notice to us on or before the cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions. We may cancel this policy with express written consent from FCIC.\n",
                  "(j) Any amount owed to us for any policy authorized under the Act will be offset from any indemnity due you for this or any other crop insured with us under the authority of the Act.\n",
                  "(1) Even if your claim has not yet been paid, you must still pay the premium and administrative fee on or before the termination date for you to remain eligible for insurance.\n",
                  "(2) If we offset any amount due us from an indemnity owed to you, the date of payment for the purpose of determining whether you have a delinquent debt will be the date FCIC publishes the final county yield for the applicable crop year.\n",
                  "(3) For this agricultural commodity policy, your premium and administrative fees will be offset from any indemnity payment due to you even if it is prior to the premium billing date.\n",
                  "(4) For any other agricultural commodity policy insured with us and it is:\n",
                  "(i) Prior to the premium billing date, and you agree, your premium and administrative fees will be offset from any indemnity payment due to you; or\n",

                  "(k) A delinquent debt for any policy will make you ineligible to obtain crop insurance authorized under the Act for any subsequent crop year and result in termination of all policies in accordance with section 2(k)(2).\n",
                  "(1) With respect to ineligibility:\n",

                  "(C) The termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which a scheduled payment is due under a written payment agreement if you fail to pay the amount owed by any payment date in any agreement to pay the debt.\n",
                  "(ii) If you are ineligible and a policy has been terminated in accordance with section 2(k)(2), you will not receive any indemnity, and such ineligibility and termination of the policy may affect your eligibility for benefits under other USDA programs. Any indemnity that may be owed for the policy before it has been terminated will remain owed to you, but may be offset in accordance with section 2(j), unless your policy was terminated in accordance with sections 2(k)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (D).\n",
                  "(2) With respect to termination:\n",
                  "(i) Termination will be effective on:\n",
                  "(A) For a policy with unpaid administrative fees or premiums, the termination date immediately subsequent to the premium billing date for the crop year (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity will be owed.);\n",
                  "(B) For a policy with other amounts due, including but not limited to, premium billed with a due date after the termination date for the crop year in which premium is earned, the termination date immediately following the date you have a delinquent debt (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity will be owed.);\n",
                  "(C) For all other policies that are issued by us under the authority of the Act, the termination date that coincides with the termination date for the policy with the delinquent debt, or if there is no coincidental termination date, the termination date immediately following the date you become ineligible; or\n",
                  "(D) For execution of a written payment agreement and failure to make any scheduled payment, the termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which you failed to make the scheduled payment (for this purpose only, the crop year will start the day after the termination date and end on the next termination date, e.g., if the termination date is November 30 and you fail to make a payment on November 15, 2019, your policy will terminate on November 30, 2018, for the 2019 crop year).\n",
                  "(ii) For all policies terminated under section 2(k)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (D), any indemnities paid subsequent to the termination date must be repaid.\n",
                  "(iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the current crop year unless:\n",
                  "(A) The termination was in error;\n",

                  "(2) Since applications for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment, or you otherwise become eligible, after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the next crop year. For example, for the 2018 crop year, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 2018, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 2019, are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 2018, and crop A's policy is terminated as of that date. Crop B's policy does not terminate until March 15, 2019, and an indemnity for the 2018 crop year may still be owed. You will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.\n",

We may only revise this information after the contract change date to correct obvious errors (e.g., the expected county revenue for a county was announced at $2,500 per acre instead of $250 per acre).\n",
                  "(c) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 3(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent.\n",
                  "(d) Not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop you will be notified, in accordance with section 20, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, CEPP, if applicable, and Special Provisions.\n",
                  "(e) Acceptance of all the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.\n",

                  "(2) That is a type not generally recognized for the area;\n",
                  "(3) For which the information necessary for insurance (projected price, expected county yield, premium rate, etc.) is not included in the actuarial documents;\n",
                  "(4) That is a volunteer crop;\n",
                  "(5) Planted following the same crop on the same acreage and the first planting of the crop has been harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions (for example, the second planting of grain sorghum would not be insurable if grain sorghum had already been planted and harvested on the same acreage during the crop year);\n",
                  "(6) That is planted for experimental purposes;\n",
                  "(7) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If the lease states that specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage; or\n",
                  "(8) That is reported as a cover crop to a USDA agency.\n",
                  "(i) No indemnity will be paid for such acreage and any indemnity already received must be repaid.\n",
                  "(ii) You will still be required to pay 60 percent of the premium you would otherwise be required to pay on those acres.\n",
                  "(c) Although certain policy documents may state that a specific crop, type, or practice is not insurable, it does not mean all other crops, types, or practices are insurable. To be insurable, the use of such crop, type, or practice must be a good faming practice, have been widely used in the county, and meet all the conditions in the Basic Provisions, the Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, and the actuarial documents.\n",
                  "The insurable acreage is all the acreage planted to the insured crop in the county in which you have a share, except as provided in section 5(d). New breaking acreage may be subject to a reduced protection factor in accordance with section 5(b) and native sod acreage may be subject to reduced premium subsidy and protection factor in accordance with section 5(c). The dollar amount of insurance per acre, amount of premium, and indemnity will be calculated separately for each crop, type, and practice shown on the actuarial documents.\n",
                  "(a) New breaking acreage consists of acreage which has not been planted and harvested, or insured, in at least 1 of the 4 previous crop years.\n",
                  "(1) For the purposes of determining new breaking acreage:\n",
                  "(i) Planted includes annual regrowth of a perennial crop;\n",

                  "(c) Native sod acreage reductions—Native sod acreage in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota may receive a reduced premium subsidy and reduced protection factor. These reductions are applicable during the first 4 crop years of planting on native sod acreage that has been tilled beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018, and during 4 cumulative crop years of insurance within the first 10 crop years after initial tillage on native sod acreage tilled after December 20, 2018. For such native sod acreage:\n",
                  "(1) Additional coverage policies receive a premium subsidy that is 50 percentage points less than would otherwise be provided on acreage not qualifying as native sod. If the premium subsidy applicable to these acres is less than 50 percent before the reduction, you will receive no premium subsidy.\n",

This election must be made for all first insured crop acreage that may be subject to an indemnity reduction if the first insured crop is insured under this policy, or on a first insured crop unit basis if the first insured crop is not insured under this policy (for example, if the first insured crop under this policy consists of 40 acres, or the first insured crop unit insured under another policy contains 40 planted acres, then no second crop can be insured on any of the 40 acres). In this case:\n",
                  "(i) If the first insured crop is insured under ARPI, you must provide written notice to us of your election not to insure acreage of a second crop by the acreage reporting date for the second crop if it is insured under ARPI, or before planting the second crop if it is insured under any other policy;\n",

                  "(a) For all acreage of the insured crop in the county, you must select the same plan of insurance (e.g., all Area Revenue Protection, all Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, or all Area Yield Protection), if such plans are available on the actuarial documents.\n",
                  "(b) You must choose a protection factor:\n",
                  "(1) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions from a range of 80 percent to 120 percent;\n",

                  "(ii) With respect to additional level of coverage, you may select any coverage level specified in the actuarial documents for each crop, type, and practice. For example: You may choose a 75 percent coverage level for one crop, type, and practice (such as corn irrigated practice) and a 90 percent coverage level for another crop, type, and practice (corn non-irrigated practice).\n",
                  "(2) For Area Yield Protection:\n",
                  "(i) CAT level of coverage is available, and you may select the CAT level of coverage for any crop, type, and practice;\n",

                  "(1) Multiply the dollar amount of insurance per acre for each crop, type, and practice by the number of acres insured for such crop, type and practice; and\n",
                  "(2) Multiply the result of paragraph (1) by your share.\n",
                  "(g) If the projected price cannot be calculated for the current crop year under the provisions contained in the CEPP and you previously chose Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion:\n",
                  "(1) Area Revenue Protection and Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion will not be provided and you will automatically be covered under the Area Yield Protection plan of insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date;\n",
                  "(2) Notice of availability of the projected price will be provided on RMA's website by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the CEPP;\n",
                  "(3) The projected price will be determined by FCIC and will be released by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the CEPP; and\n",
                  "(4) Your coverage will automatically revert back to Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, whichever is applicable, for the next crop year that revenue protection is available unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date.\n",

                  "(g) Premium or administrative fees owed by you will be offset from an indemnity due you in accordance with section 2(j).\n",
                  "(h) If you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, your premium subsidy will be 10 percentage points greater than the premium subsidy that you would otherwise receive, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.\n",

                  "(ii) Divide each result of section 13(d)(3)(i) by the number of acres of the first insured crop that were planted in each respective year (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 50 divided by 100 equals 50 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2019 and 70 divided by 100 equals 70 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2020);\n",
                  "(iii) Add the results of section 13(d)(3)(ii) and divide by the number of years the first insured crop was double cropped (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 50 plus 70 equals 120 divided by 2 equals 60 percent); and\n",
                  "(iv) Multiply the result of section 13(d)(3)(iii) by the number of insured acres of the first insured crop (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 60 percent multiplied by the number of wheat acres insured in 2021);\n",
                  "(e) If any Federal or State agency requires destruction of any insured crop or crop production, as applicable, because it contains levels of a substance, or has a condition, that is injurious to human or animal health in excess of the maximum amounts allowed by the Food and Drug Administration, other public health organizations of the United States or an agency of the applicable State, you must destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, and certify that such insured crop or crop production has been destroyed prior to receiving an indemnity payment. Failure to destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, will result in you having to repay any indemnity paid and you may be subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with section 515(h) of the Act and 7 CFR part 400, subpart R, and any applicable civil or criminal sanctions.\n",
                  "(a) Insurance will be provided for a crop grown using an organic farming practice for only those acres of the crop that meet the requirements for an organic crop on the acreage reporting date.\n",
                  "(b) If an organic type or practice is shown on the actuarial documents, the projected price, dollar amount of insurance, policy protection, premium rate, etc., for such organic crop, type and practice will be used unless otherwise specified in the actuarial documents. If an organic type or practice is not shown on the actuarial documents, the projected price, dollar amount of insurance, policy protection, premium rate, etc., for the non-organic crop, type and practice will be used.\n",
                  "(c) If insurance is provided for an organic farming practice as specified in section 14(a) and (b), only the following acreage will be insured under such practice:\n",
                  "(1) Certified organic acreage;\n",

                  "(d) On the date you report your acreage, you must have:\n",
                  "(1) For certified organic acreage, a written certification in effect directly from a certifying agent indicating the name of the person certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (a certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement). A certificate issued from the National Organic Program's Organic Integrity Database (or successor certificate reporting tool) is acceptable;\n",
                  "(2) For transitional acreage, an organic system plan documenting the use of practices that would result in certified organic status that includes the record information as described in section 14(d)(1), or written documentation from a certifying agent indicating an organic system plan is in effect for the acreage; and\n",
                  "(3) Records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of each field of certified organic, transitional, buffer zone, and acreage not maintained under organic management.\n",
                  "(a) The data source used for the county yields will be based on the best available data and will be specified in the actuarial documents.\n",
                  "(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the data source used to establish the expected county yield will be the data source used to establish the final county yield.\n",
                  "(c) If the data source used to establish the expected county yield is not able to provide credible data to establish the final county yield because the data is no longer available, credible, or reflect changes that may have occurred after the yield was established;\n",
                  "(1) FCIC will determine the final county yield based on the most accurate data available from subsection (g), as determined by FCIC; or\n",
                  "(2) To the extent that practices used during the crop year change from those upon which the expected county yield is based, the final county yield may be adjusted to reflect the yield that would have resulted but for the change in practice. For example, if the county is traditionally 90 percent irrigated and 10 percent non-irrigated, but this year the county is now 50 percent irrigated and 50 percent non-irrigated, the final county yield will be adjusted to an amount as if the county had 90 percent irrigated acreage.\n",
                  "(d) If the final county yield is established from a data source other than that used to establish the expected county yield, FCIC will provide notice of the data source and the reason for the change at the time the final county yield is published.\n",
                  "(e) The final county yield determined by FCIC is considered final for the purposes of establishing whether an indemnity is due and will not be revised for any reason.\n",
                  "(f) Yields used under this insurance program for a crop may be based on crop insurance data, other USDA data, or other data sources, if elected by FCIC. \n",
                  "(a) You may assign your right to an indemnity for the crop year only to creditors or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation. You may be required to provide proof of the debt or other pecuniary obligation before we will accept the assignment of indemnity.\n",
                  "(b) All assignments must be on our form and must be provided to us. Each assignment form may contain more than one creditor or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation.\n",

Under no circumstances will we be liable:\n",
                  "(1) To any lienholder or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation where you have failed to include such lienholder or person on a properly executed assignment of indemnity provided to us; or\n",
                  "(2) To pay to all lienholders or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation any amount greater than the total amount of indemnity owed under the policy.\n",
                  "(d) If we have received the properly executed assignment of indemnity form, only one payment will be issued jointly in the names of all assignees and you, unless all assignees and you agree in writing for the payment to be issued to a single payee.\n",

                  "(b) You must demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect (for example, an application to transfer your policy or written notification to an insurance provider that states you want to purchase, or transfer, insurance and you want any other policies for the crop canceled would demonstrate you did not intend to have duplicate policies) and:\n",

If you fail to notify us, in addition to the reduction of your approved yield described herein, you will be considered to have misreported information and you will be subject to the consequences in section 6(g). For example, for a non-irrigated APH database, your yield is based upon acreage of the crop that is watered once prior to planting, and the crop is not watered prior to planting for the current crop year. Your approved APH yield will be reduced to an amount consistent with the actual production history of your other non-irrigated APH database where the crop has not been watered prior to planting or limited to the non-irrigated transitional yield for the APH database if other such APH databases do not exist.\n",

If you cancel an election, the actual yield will be used in the APH database. For example, if you elected to substitute yields in your APH database for the 2020 and 2021 crop year, for any subsequent crop year, you can elect to cancel the substitution for either or both crop years.\n",

(For example, if you elect to exclude a 2020 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2020 crop year in the county will be used. If you also elect to exclude a 2021 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2021 crop year in the county will be used.) The replacement yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.\n",
                  "(iii) Once you have elected to exclude an actual yield from the APH database, the replacement yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(a)(1)(i).\n",
                  "(iv) Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the substitution of higher yields.\n",
                  "(2) You may exclude any actual yield for any crop year when FCIC determines for a county, or its contiguous counties, the per planted acre yield was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield for the crop in the county for the previous 10 consecutive crop years.\n",
                  "(3) You may replace actual yields determined using your post-quality production amounts with actual yields determined using your pre-quality production amounts for previous crop years on an individual actual yield basis.\n",
                  "(i) Each election made in section 36(a)(3) must be made on or before the sales closing date for the insured crop and will remain in effect, unless canceled by the sales closing date for the succeeding crop year.\n",
                  "(ii) In order to replace post-quality actual yields for previous crop years, you must have filed a notice of loss due to an insured cause of loss for the crop year to be eligible.\n",
                  "(iii) Once the pre-quality actual yield replaces the post-quality actual yield, the pre-quality actual yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database, unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(a)(3)(i).\n",
                  "(iv) Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the replacement of higher pre-quality reduction based actual yields.\n",
                  "(b) You may make adjustments to your approved yield by limiting a reduction to the approved APH yield to a maximum decline of 10 percent of the previous crop year's approved APH yield when such reduction is due to a decline in production resulting from a natural disaster or other insurable loss, as provided in FCIC procedures.\n",

If a marketing certification is required, it must be completed in writing within 15 days of the initial notice.\n",
                  "(2) If you fail to notify us timely and complete the marketing certification in accordance with these provisions and if you do not have acceptable verifiable production records to support the information you certified on your production report, you will receive an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(g).\n",
                  "(3) We may determine that the marketing certification is not required for your crop based on FCIC procedures.\n",

                  "(i) If we determine an appraisal is necessary, we must notify you.\n",
                  "(ii) If you request an appraisal, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to harvest.\n",
                  "(5) Appraisals conducted for production reporting purposes may not be applicable for establishing total production to count under section 15 when the appraisal was conducted prior to our receipt of a notice of loss."

If the Special Provisions allow a reduced premium amount for acreage intentionally destroyed prior to harvest, you may qualify for such reduction only if you notify us in writing on or before the date designated in the Special Provisions of the intended destruction, and do not claim an indemnity on the acreage. No premium reduction will be allowed if the required notice is not given or if you claim an indemnity for the acreage. Upon receiving timely notice, insurance coverage on the acreage you do not intend to harvest will cease and we will revise your acreage report to indicate the applicable reduction in premium. If you do not destroy the crop as intended, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions. \n",

Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to Khorasan at the same levels applicable to durum wheat; \n",
                  "(iv) Quality factors for hull-less barley fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause barley to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if barley grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less barley would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of barley will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less barley. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less barley at the same levels applicable to barley; \n",
                  "(v) Quality factors for hull-less oats fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause oats to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if oats grade less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less oats would be eligible for quality adjustment if the test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of oats will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less oats. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less oats at the same levels applicable to oats; or \n",

                  "(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; \n",
                  "(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed by: \n",
                  "(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act; \n",

                  "(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and \n",
                  "(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us. \n",
                  "(4) Small grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor calculated in accordance with the Special Provisions.\n",
                  "(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis. \n",
                  "A late planting period is applicable to small grains, except to any barley or wheat acreage covered under the terms of the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement. Barley or wheat covered under the terms of the Winter Coverage Endorsement must be planted on or prior to the applicable final planting date specified in the Special Provisions. In counties having one winter final planting date for acreage covered under the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement and another winter final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement, the winter late planting period will begin after the final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement.\n",
                  "Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents. In counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring type, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop."

For example, if you elect 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a variety within a population density for the crop, you must select 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for that variety for all population densities for the crop. The amount of insurance for each variety and population density must be multiplied by any applicable factor contained in section 3(b)(2). \n",

                  "(iii) Eighty percent (0.80) for the second growing season after being set out, the third year following dehorning, or the third year following grafting of a set out tree; or \n",

For example, if the amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the remaining stand is 85 percent of the original stand, the amount of insurance on which the premium and any indemnity will be based is $1,700 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.85). \n",
                  "(5) If any insurable acreage of trees is set out after the first day of the crop year, and you elect to insure such acreage during that crop year, you must report the acreage, practice, crop, number of trees, date set out is completed, and your share to us within 72 hours after set out is completed for the unit. \n",

                  "(b) In addition to section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we do not insure any citrus trees:\n",
                  "(1) During the crop year the application for insurance is filed, unless we inspect the acreage and consider it acceptable; or\n",
                  "(2) That have been grafted onto existing root stock or nursery stock within the one-year period prior to the date insurance attaches.\n",
                  "(c) We may exclude from insurance or limit the amount of insurance on any acreage that was not insured the previous year. \n",
                  "In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, citrus trees interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable, unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy. \n",

You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the grove.\n",
                  "(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is November 20.\n",
                  "(b) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.\n",
                  "(c) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:\n",
                  "(1) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;\n",

                  "(7) Diseases, but only if specified in the Special Provisions.\n",
                  "(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:\n",
                  "(1) Damage to the blossoms or trees; or\n",
                  "(2) Inability to market the citrus fruit for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.\n",
                  "(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:\n",
                  "(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or\n",
                  "(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.\n",
                  "(b) If any citrus fruit within a unit is damaged by an insurable cause of loss, we will settle your claim by:\n",
                  "(1) Calculating the amount of insurance for the unit by multiplying the number of acres by the respective dollar amount of insurance per acre for each applicable combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees in the unit and multiplying that result by your share;\n",
                  "(2) Calculating the average percent of damage to the fruit within each respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent (0.1%) (To determine the percent of damage, the amount of citrus fruit damaged from an insured cause must be converted to boxes and divided by the potential production);\n",
                  "(3) Subtracting the deductible from the result of section 10(b)(2);\n",
                  "(4) If the result of section 10(b)(3) is positive, dividing this result by the coverage level percentage (If the result of section 10(b)(3) is negative, no indemnity will be due);\n",
                  "(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(4) by the amount of insurance for the unit for the respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, to determine the value of all damage; and\n",
                  "(6) Totaling all such results of section 10(b)(5) for all applicable combinations of commodity types, intended uses, and age classes of trees in the unit and subtracting any indemnities paid for the current crop year to determine the amount payable for the unit. For example, assume a 55-acre unit sustains late season damage. No previous damage has occurred on the unit during the crop year and no fruit has been harvested. The producer elected the 75 percent coverage level and has a 100 percent share. The amount of insurance is $1,180 per acre, based on the 75 percent coverage level, for the commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees. The amount of potential production is 24,530 boxes and the amount of damaged production is 17,171 boxes. The loss would be calculated as follows:\n",
                  "1. 55 acres × $1,180 = $64,900 amount of insurance for the unit;\n",
                  "2. 17,171 ÷ 24,530 = 70 percent average percent of damage;\n",
                  "3. 70 percent damage −25 percent deductible (100 percent −75 percent) = 45 percent;\n",
                  "4. 45 percent ÷ 75 percent = 60 percent adjusted damage; and\n",
                  "5. 60 percent × $64,900 = $38,940 indemnity.\n",
                  "(c) Any individual citrus fruit will be considered 100 percent damaged, if due to an insurable cause of loss it is:\n",
                  "(1) On the ground and unmarketable; or\n",
                  "(2) Unmarketable because it is immature, unwholesome, decomposed, adulterated, or otherwise unfit for human consumption.\n",
                  "(d) Any citrus fruit that can be processed into products for human consumption will be considered marketable. The percent of damage for the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) will be determined by:\n",
                  "(1) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from:\n",
                  "(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or\n",
                  "(ii) The default juice content provided in the Special Provisions, if at least three years of acceptable juice records are not furnished or the citrus fruit is insured as fresh;\n",
                  "(2) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions;\n",
                  "(3) Dividing the result of section 10(d)(1) by the result of 10(d)(2);\n",
                  "(4) Dividing the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions by:\n",
                  "(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or\n",

                  "(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(3) by the result of 10(d)(4); and\n",
                  "(6) For citrus fruit insured as fresh that has a Fresh Fruit Factor listed in the Special Provisions, making an additional adjustment to the percent of damage by:\n",
                  "(i) Subtracting the result of section 10(d)(5) from 1;\n",
                  "(ii) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(6)(i) by the applicable Fresh Fruit Factor located in the Special Provisions; and\n",
                  "(iii) Adding the result of section 10(d)(6)(ii) to the result of section 10(d)(5).\n",
                  "(e) Notwithstanding section 10(d), for citrus fruit insured as fresh, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, any individual citrus fruit not meeting the applicable United States Standards for packing as fresh fruit due to an insured cause of loss will be considered 100 percent damaged, except that the percent of damage for any production sold for an alternative use will be adjusted in accordance with section 10(d).\n",

We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and \n",

                  "(2) For units damaged by rain—By adding the delivered tons to any verified loss of production due to rain damage. When production from a portion of the acreage within a unit is removed from the vineyard and production from the remaining acreage is lost in the vineyard, the amount of production lost in the vineyard will be determined based on the number of tons of raisins produced on the acreage from which production was removed. When no production has been removed from the vineyard, the amount of production lost in the vineyard will be determined based on an appraisal.\n",
                  "(3) Insured tonnage will be adjusted as follows:\n",
                  "(i) The insured tonnage will be reduced 0.12 percent for each 0.10 percent of moisture in excess of 16.0 percent. For example, 10.0 tons of raisins containing 18.0 percent moisture will be reduced to 9.760 tons of raisins;\n",
                  "(ii) Insured tonnage used for dry edible fruit will be reduced by 0.10 percent for each 0.10 percent of substandard raisins in excess of 5.0 percent; and\n",
                  "(iii) When raisins contain moisture in excess of 24.3 percent at the time of delivery and are released for a use other than dry edible fruit (e.g. distillery material), they will be considered to contain 24.3 percent moisture.\n",
                  "(4) If any raisins are delivered, the moisture content will be determined at the time of delivery.\n",
                  "(d) Section 3(c) of the Basic Provisions is not applicable to this crop.\n",
                  "In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is April 30 preceding the cancellation date.\n",
                  "In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation and Termination) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are July 31.\n",
                  "In lieu of the provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):\n",
                  "(a) You must report by unit, and on our form, the acreage on which you intend to produce raisins for the crop year. This acreage report must be submitted to us on or before the sales closing date, and contain the following information:\n",
                  "(1) All acreage of the crop (insurable and not insurable) in which you will have a share;\n",
                  "(2) Your anticipated share at the time coverage will begin;\n",
                  "(3) The variety; and\n",
                  "(4) The location of each vineyard.\n",
                  "(b) Acreage of the crop acquired after the acreage was reported, may be included on the acreage report if we agree to accept the additional acreage. Such additional acreage will not be added to the acreage report after you first place raisins from the additional acreage on trays for drying. Failure to report any acreage in which you have a share will result in denial of liability. If you elect not to produce raisins on any part of the acreage included on your acreage report, you must notify us in writing on or before September 21, and provide any records we may require to verify that raisins were not produced on that acreage.\n",
                  "(c) If you fail to file an acreage report in a timely manner, or if the information reported is incorrect, we may deny liability on any unit.\n",
                  "(d) In addition to the acreage report, you must annually submit a tonnage report, on our form, which includes by unit the number of delivered tons of raisins, and, if damage has occurred, the amount of any tonnage we determined was lost due to rain damage in the vineyard for each unit designated in the acreage report.\n",
                  "(e) The tonnage report must be submitted to us as soon as the information is available, but not later than March 1 of the year following the crop year. Indemnities may be determined on the basis of information you submitted on this report. If you do not submit this report by the reporting date, we may, at our option, either determine the insured tonnage and share by unit or we may deny liability on any unit. This report may be revised only upon our approval. Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us at any time we discover the error.\n",
                  "In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 (Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the annual premium amount is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance for the unit at the time insurance attaches by the premium rate and then multiplying that result by any applicable premium adjustment factors that may apply.\n",
                  "(a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all the raisins in the county of grape varieties for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents and in which you have a share.\n",
                  "(b) In addition to the raisins not insurable under section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we do not insure any raisins:\n",
                  "(1) Laid on trays after September 8 in vineyards with north-south rows in Merced or Stanislaus Counties, or after September 20 in all other counties;\n",
                  "(2) From table grape strippings; or\n",
                  "(3) From vines that received manual, mechanical, or chemical treatment to produce table grape sizing.\n",

                  "(c) The date the raisins are removed from the vineyard;\n",
                  "(d) Total destruction of all raisins on a unit;\n",
                  "(e) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit; or\n",
                  "(f) Abandonment of the raisins.\n",
                  "(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against unavoidable loss of production resulting from rain that occurs during the insurance period and while the raisins are on trays or in rolls in the vineyard for drying.\n",
                  "(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to inability to market the raisins for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a person to accept production.\n",
                  "(a) We may require you to recondition a representative sample of not more than 10 tons of damaged raisins to determine if they meet standards established by the RAC once reconditioned. If such standards are met, we may require you to recondition all the damaged production. If we determine that it is possible to recondition any damaged production and, if you do not do so, we will value the damaged production at the reference maximum dollar amount, except if your damaged production undergoes a USDA inspection and is stored by your packer with other producer's production to be reconditioned at a later date. If we agree, in writing, that it is not practical to recondition the damaged production, we will determine the number of tons meeting RAC standards that could be obtained if the production were reconditioned.\n",
                  "(b) If the representative sample of raisins that we require you to recondition does not meet RAC standards for marketable raisins after reconditioning, the reconditioning payment will be the actual cost you incur to recondition the sample, not to exceed an amount that is reasonable and customary for such reconditioning, regardless of the coverage level selected.\n",
                  "(c) A reconditioning payment, based on the actual (unadjusted) weight of the raisins, will be made if:\n",
                  "(1) Insured raisin production:\n",
                  "(i) Is damaged by rain within the insurance period;\n",
                  "(ii) Is reconditioned by washing with water and then drying;\n",
                  "(iii) Is insured at a coverage level greater than that applicable to the catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance; and either\n",
                  "(2) The damaged production undergoes an inspection by USDA and is found to contain mold, embedded sand, or other rain-caused contamination determined by micro-analysis in excess of standards established by the RAC, or is found to contain moisture in excess of 18 percent; or\n",
                  "(3) We give you consent to recondition the damaged production.\n",
                  "(d) Your request for consent to any wash-and-dry reconditioning must identify the acreage on which the production to be reconditioned was damaged in order to be eligible for a reconditioning payment.\n",
                  "(e) The reconditioning payment for raisins that meet RAC standards for marketable raisins after reconditioning will be the lesser of your actual cost for reconditioning or the amount determined by:\n",
                  "(1) Multiplying the greater of $125.00 or the reconditioning dollar amount per ton contained in the Special Provisions by your coverage level;\n",
                  "(2) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(1) by the actual number of tons of raisins (unadjusted weight) that are wash-and-dry reconditioned; and\n",
                  "(3) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(2) by your share.\n",
                  "(f) Only one reconditioning payment will be made for any lot of raisins damaged during the crop year. Multiple reconditioning payments for the same production will not be made.\n",
                  "(a) In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:\n",
                  "(1) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give us notice within 72 hours of the time the rain fell on the raisins. We may reject any claim for indemnity if such notice is later. You must provide us the following information when you give us this notice:\n",
                  "(i) The grape variety;\n",
                  "(ii) The location of the vineyard and number of acres; and\n",
                  "(iii) The number of vines from which the raisins were harvested.\n",
                  "(2) We will not pay any indemnity unless you:\n",
                  "(i) Authorize us in writing to obtain all relevant records from any raisin packer, raisin reconditioner, the RAC, or any other person who may have such records. If you fail to meet the requirements of this subsection, all insured production will be considered undamaged and valued at the reference maximum dollar value.\n",
                  "(ii) Upon our request, provide us with records of previous years' production and acreage. This information may be used to establish the amount of insured tonnage when insurable damage results in discarded production.\n",
                  "(b) In lieu of the provisions in section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8) that require you to submit a claim for indemnity not later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period, any claim for indemnity must be submitted to us not later than March 31 following the date for the end of the insurance period.\n",
                  "(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:\n",
                  "(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or\n",
                  "(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the acreage from which raisins were removed for each unit.\n",
                  "(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",
                  "(1) Multiplying the insured tonnage of raisins by the reference maximum dollar amount and your coverage level percentage;\n",
                  "(2) Subtracting from the total in section 13(b)(1) the total value of all insured damaged and undamaged raisins; and\n",
                  "(3) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(2) by your share.\n",
                  "(c) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity, your share will not exceed the lesser of your share at the time insurance attaches or at the time of loss.\n",
                  "(d) Undamaged raisins or raisins damaged solely by uninsured causes will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.\n",
                  "(e) Raisins damaged partially by rain and partially by uninsured causes will be valued at the highest prices obtainable, adjusted for any reduction in value due to uninsured causes.\n",
                  "(f) Raisins that are damaged by rain, but that are reconditioned and meet RAC standards for raisins, will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.\n",
                  "(g) The value to count for any raisins produced on the unit that are damaged by rain and not removed from the vineyard will be the larger of the appraised salvage value or $35.00 per ton, except that any raisins that are damaged and discarded from trays or are lost from trays scattered in the vineyard as part of normal handling will not be considered to have any value. You must box and deliver any raisins that can be removed from the vineyard.\n",
                  "(h) At our sole option, we may acquire all the rights and title to your share of any raisins damaged by rain. In such event, the raisins will be valued at zero in determining the amount of loss and we will have the right of ingress and egress to the extent necessary to take possession, care for, and remove such raisins.\n",
                  "(i) Raisins destroyed, put to another use without our consent, or abandoned will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.\n",

Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.\n",

                  "(a) In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:\n",
                  "(1) Adverse weather conditions;\n",
                  "(2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;\n",

                  "(8) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures.\n",
                  "(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to inability to market the prunes for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.\n",

                  "(1) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.\n",
                  "(2) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing or is sold as fresh fruit production. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.\n",
                  "(3) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production.\n",
                  "(4) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.\n",
                  "(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:\n",
                  "(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or\n",
                  "(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.\n",
                  "(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",

                  "(3) If the peanuts are not grown under a contract, the replanting payments will be valued using the price election as specified in the Special Provisions. If the unit has peanuts grown under a sheller contract and peanuts not grown under a sheller contract, the replanted acreage must be prorated between the contract and non-contract acreage by determining the acreage grown under a contract and the remaining acreage in the unit (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were replanted, the production guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, there is a sheller contract for $0.23 for 25,000 pounds, the remaining peanuts are not grown under a sheller contract, and the price election in the Special Provisions is for $0.20.

You must provide us with records that are acceptable to us which clearly shows the number of pounds, price per pound, and the quality of such tobacco.\n",
                  "(5) Any reduction in the production to count will be determined by:\n",

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and \n",

                  "(1) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, due to insurable causes, it has a value of less than 75 percent of the average market price of undamaged grapes of the same or similar variety. The value per ton of the qualifying damaged production and the average market price of undamaged grapes will be determined on the earlier of the date the damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The average market price of undamaged production will be calculated by averaging the prices being paid by usual marketing outlets for the area during the week in which the damaged grapes were valued. \n",

Fall-planted types are only insurable if there is an adequate stand in the spring. Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not make that determination prior to the spring final planting date, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. Fall-planted acreage must be reported and insured if it meets the requirements of section 8.\n",

Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.\n",
                  "(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of table grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due or indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year unless:\n",

                  "(2) Inability to market the table grapes for any reason other than the actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.\n",
                  "In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:\n",
                  "(a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.\n",
                  "(b) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.\n",
                  "(c) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season and you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must also provide notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity as a result of the damage previously reported. You must not destroy the damaged crop until the earlier of 15 days from the date you gave notice of loss, or our written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.\n",
                  "(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:\n",
                  "(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or\n",
                  "(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.\n",
                  "(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",
                  "(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;\n",
                  "(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected for each type or variety;\n",

                  "(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(5) from the result in section 12(b)(3); and \n",

                  "(c) The total production to count (in lugs) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include: \n",
                  "(1) All appraised production as follows: \n",
                  "(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage: \n",
                  "(A) That is abandoned; \n",
                  "(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements in section 11(b); \n",
                  "(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or \n",
                  "(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records; \n",
                  "(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; \n",
                  "(iii) Unharvested production that meets, or would meet if properly handled, the state quality standards, if specified in the Special Provisions, or the appropriate USDA grade standard (if no state standard is specified); and\n",
                  "(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and \n",
                  "(2) All harvested production from insurable acreage regardless of condition or disposition. The quantity of production to count for table grape production damaged by insurable causes within the insurance period that is marketed for any use other than table grapes will be determined by multiplying the greater of (1) the value of the table grapes per ton or (2) $50, by the number of tons and dividing that result by the highest price election available for the insured unit. This result will be the number of lugs to count. \n",

                  "(2) If you lose or relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of stonefruit on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:\n",

                  "(3) Inability to market the insured crop for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.\n",

                  "(a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should have started if the insured crop will not be harvested.\n",
                  "(b) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.\n",
                  "(c) In addition to section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give us notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count.\n",
                  "(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:\n",
                  "(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or\n",
                  "(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.\n",
                  "(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",
                  "(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type by its respective production guarantee;\n",
                  "(2) Multiplying each result of section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for the type and by the percent of the price election;\n",

                  "(b) If the Special Provisions permit or you have a written agreement authorizing direct marketing, you must notify us at least 15 days before harvest begins if any production from any unit will be harvested for  direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine the dollar value of your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised dollar value of production to count that is not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the direct-marketed acreage if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.\n",
                  "(c) If you intend to claim an indemnity, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if a loss occurs during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production.\n",

                  "(a) Indemnities will be calculated separately for each year in the two-year coverage module.\n",
                  "(b) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable records for any:\n",
                  "(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such records were not provided and this will be the unit structure the current crop year and the subsequent crop year of the two-year coverage module (provided another year remains in the two-year coverage module); or\n",
                  "(2) Basic unit, we will allocate commingled production or revenue to each basic unit in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.\n",
                  "(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",

                  "(ii) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of multiplying the total dollar value of the total production to count determined in accordance with section 13(d) by the catastrophic risk protection factor contained in the Special Provisions; and\n",

                  "(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the value of production to count; and\n",

(If the price received is not verifiable by sales receipts or if the pecan production was direct marketed, the market price will be used. Unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, and excluding pecans sold under contract, the price received will be not less than 95 percent of the lowest AMS price for the nearest location for similar quality, quantity, and variety of in-shell pecans published during the week you sell your pecans. If AMS prices are not published for the week the pecans were sold, the price received will be not less than 95 percent of the lowest price per pound for in-shell pecans of the same variety or varieties insured offered by buyers in the area you normally market the pecans or the area nearest to you if prices are not available in your immediate area on the day you sell your pecans.);\n",

You elected not to harvest the other 30 acres of pecans. The 30 acres were appraised at 100 pounds per acre and on the day of the appraisal the average AMS price was $0.65.

                  "(2) For any processor contract that stipulates only the amount of production to be delivered, and notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, no indemnity will be paid for any loss of production on any unit if you produced a crop sufficient to fulfill the processor contract(s) forming the basis of the insurance guarantee;\n",
                  "(b) The extent of any damaged cabbage production must be determined not later than the date the cabbage is placed in storage if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date the cabbage is delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, processor, or other handler if production is not stored.\n",
                  "(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:\n",

You are only able to harvest 9,000 hundredweight of fresh market cabbage and 9,000 hundredweight of cabbage for sauerkraut because an insured cause of loss has reduced production. Your total indemnity would be calculated as follows:\n",
                  "(1) 50 acres × 400 hundredweight = 20,000 hundredweight guarantee for the fresh market acreage.\n",

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to adequately care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and\n",
