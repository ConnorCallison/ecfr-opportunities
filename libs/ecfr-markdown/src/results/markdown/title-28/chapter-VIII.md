    § 800.1   Statutory authorization.

#### § § 800.1

    The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (“Revitalization Act”) established the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (“CSOSA”) within the federal government as an independent executive branch agency and placed the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency as an independent entity within CSOSA. In addition, the District of Columbia Public Defender Service, an independent District of Columbia agency, receives its appropriated federal funds through a transfer from CSOSA.

    (a)  (1) The Revitalization Act requires CSOSA to provide supervision, through qualified supervision officers, to offenders on probation, parole, and supervised release for violation of District of Columbia Code offenses. The Agency carries out its responsibilities on behalf of the court or agency having jurisdiction over the person being supervised. Accordingly, CSOSA supervises all offenders placed on probation by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and all individuals on parole pursuant to the District of Columbia Code. CSOSA supervises offenders from other jurisdictions in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Parole and Probation Compact.

    (2) CSOSA is also required to determine uniform supervision and reporting practices, develop and operate intermediate sanctions programs for sentenced offenders, and arrange for the supervision of District of Columbia Code offenders in jurisdictions outside the District of Columbia.

    (3) In accordance with its supervisory functions and as authorized by the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999 (D.C. Law 13-137, D.C. Code 24-1101 ), CSOSA operates and maintains the sex offender registry for the District of Columbia.

    (b)  (1) The District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (“PSA”) assists the trial and appellate levels of both the federal and local courts in determining eligibility for pretrial release by providing verified background information and criminal histories on all arrestees and recommendations about available release options.

    (2) PSA is further responsible for supervising defendants released from custody during the pretrial period by monitoring compliance with conditions of release and by ensuring that they appear for scheduled court hearings.

    (3) PSA also provides defendants with the opportunity to participate in a variety of social intervention programs that decrease the likelihood of future criminal behavior.

    § 800.4   Director.

#### § § 800.4

    (a) CSOSA is headed by a Director appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of six years.

    (b) PSA is headed by a Director appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in consultation with an Executive Committee.

  PART 801—FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT PROCEDURE

### Part 801

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; Pub. L. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251, 712 (D.C. Code 24-1233); 28 CFR 14.11.

**Source:** Source: 67 FR 57948, Sept. 13, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

    § 801.1   Claims filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

#### § § 801.1

    If an agency employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment and causes injury to a member of the public, any claim for money damages for personal injury, death, damage to property, or loss of property caused by the employee's negligent or wrongful act or omission is a claim against the United States and must first be presented by the injured party to the appropriate federal agency for administrative action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. General provisions for processing such administrative claims are contained in 28 CFR part 14. The provisions in this part supplement the general provisions in order to describe specific procedures to follow when filing a claim with the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (“CSOSA”) or the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (“PSA”).

    § 801.2   Filing a claim.

#### § § 801.2

    (a)  You may file a claim for money damages against CSOSA or PSA if you believe that a CSOSA or PSA employee has injured you or has damaged or lost property that you own. You may file a claim on behalf of an injured or deceased person or owner of damaged or lost property if you are acting as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, legal or other representative provided you submit evidence of your authority to act on behalf of the claimant.

    (b)  (1) The easiest way to ensure that you will include all necessary information for your claim is to submit a completed Standard Form 95 (“SF 95”). The SF 95 is available from the Office of the General Counsel, CSOSA, (see address in paragraph (c) of this section) and on the Internet at

    (2) If you do not use the SF 95, you must submit written notification of the incident that resulted in the injury, loss, or damage. Along with this notification, you must present a claim for money damages in a sum certain (that is, a precise dollar amount) for injury to or loss of property, personal injury, or death alleged to have occurred on the basis of the incident. Failure to include the precise dollar amount for your claim may mean that you will have difficulty pursuing your claim in court.

    (c)  You should submit the claim (whether against CSOSA or PSA) directly to the Office of the General Counsel, CSOSA, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004. Claims submitted to any other office of CSOSA or PSA are forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel.

    (d)  You must submit the claim so that CSOSA/PSA receives the claim within 2 years after the claim accrues. Mailing the claim by that date is not sufficient if CSOSA/PSA does not receive the claim by that date. Generally speaking, a claim accrues at the time of the injury. In those instances where neither the injury nor its cause is immediately apparent, the claim accrues when you discover (or reasonably should discover) the injury and its cause.

    (e)  Yes, you may amend your claim at any time prior to final agency action or prior to your filing suit in court.

    § 801.3   Processing the claim.

#### § § 801.3

    (a)  (1) If you have provided all necessary information to process your claim, you will receive an acknowledgement indicating the filing date (that is, the date CSOSA/PSA received your claim) and the assigned claim number. Refer to the claim number in any further correspondence you may have with CSOSA/PSA on the claim.

    (2) If you have failed to include all necessary information, CSOSA/PSA will return your claim to you with a request for the necessary additional information.

    (3) If your claim should have been filed with another agency, CSOSA/PSA will forward the claim to the appropriate agency and notify you of the transfer, or return the claim to you if the appropriate agency cannot be determined or if the transfer is otherwise not feasible.

    (b)  The General Counsel is responsible for investigating the claim and, after consultation with PSA (if the claim is against PSA) and the Department of Justice when appropriate, determining whether the claim should be settled or denied.

    (c)  CSOSA/PSA has 6 months from the date of filing to make a settlement offer or to deny your claim. If you amend your claim (see § 801.2(e)) or request that your claim be reconsidered (see § 801.4(b)(1)), CSOSA/PSA has an additional 6 months from the date of the amendment or the filing of the request for reconsideration to make a final disposition of the claim.

    (d)  Yes, appreciation or depreciation is considered in settling a claim for lost or damaged property.

    § 801.4   Final disposition of claim.

#### § § 801.4

    (a)  If you accept a settlement offer, you give up your right to bring a lawsuit against the United States or against any employee of the government whose action or lack of action gave rise to your claim.

    (b)  (1) If your claim is denied, you have 30 days from the date of CSOSA/PSA's written notification to make a written request that the agency reconsider the denial.

    (2) If your claim is denied or you reject the settlement offer, you have 6 months from the date of mailing of CSOSA/PSA's notice of denial to file a civil action in the appropriate U.S. District Court.

    (c)  If you do not hear from CSOSA/PSA within 6 months of the filing date for the claim, you may consider your claim denied. You may then proceed with filing a civil action in the appropriate U.S. District Court.

The Agency provides for the disclosure and production of records in response to FOIA/PA requests, a demand from a court, or other non-congressional authority in connection with a proceeding to which the Agency is not a party. Due to CSOSA's nature as a federal agency with a local mission connected to the District of Columbia, exemption protections, including exclusions, are allowed under the FOIA and other safeguard requirements may be applied under the PA.

      (b) It is the policy of CSOSA that all employees of CSOSA and PSA (collectively the “Agency”) are to submit all FOIA/PA requests to the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”). The OGC shall make release determinations under either the FOIA/PA pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections §§ 802.6, 802.7, 802.8, 802.14, 802.15, and 802.16.

      § 802.5   Definitions.

#### § § 802.5

      As used in this subpart, the following terms have the following meanings:

      (a)  has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 551(1) and 5 U.S.C. 552(f).

      (b)  means a request for a review of the agency's determination with regard to a fee waiver, category of requester, expedited processing, or denial in whole or in part of a request for access to a record or records.

      (c)  means trade secrets or other commercial or financial information.

      (d)  means any entity which provides business information to the Agency and which has a proprietary interest in the information.

      (e)  means tools by which records are created, stored, and retrieved. Normally, computer software, including source code, object code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless of medium, are not agency records. Proprietary (or copyrighted) software is not an agency record.

      (f)  means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

      (g)  refers to the process of making a copy of a record in order to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation ( magnetic tape or disk), among others.

      (h)  mean those records and information which are created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means. This ordinarily does not include computer software, which is a tool by which to create, store, or retrieve electronic records.

      (i)  is defined pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3301.

      (j)  means any request for records made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3).

      (k)  means any person who makes a request for access to records.

      (l)  for fee purposes, refers to the process of examining records located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any records for disclosure;  doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release.

      (m)  includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within records. _Search_es may be done manually or by automated means.

      § 802.6   Freedom of Information Act requests.

#### § § 802.6

      (a) (1) Requests for any record (including policy) ordinarily will be processed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Your request must be made in writing and addressed to the FOIA Public Liaison Officer, Office of the General Counsel FOIA Office, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., 12th Floor, Washington, DC 20004. The requester should clearly mark on the face of the letter and the envelope “Freedom of Information Act Request.”

      (2) Your request will be considered received as of the date it is received by CSOSA's FOIA Office.

      (3) Generally, all FOIA requests will be processed in the approximate order of receipt, unless the requester shows exceptional circumstances exist to justify an expedited response ( § 802.8).

      (4) You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable Agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient and subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the more likely the Agency will be able to locate the records in response to your request. If a determination is made that your request does not reasonably describe records, the Agency will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. You will be given the opportunity to discuss your request so that you may modify it to meet the requirements of this section.

      (5)(i)  (A) An offender/defendant making a FOIA/PA request must provide his or her full name, current address, and date of birth. In addition, the requester must provide with the request his or her signature, which must be either notarized or sworn under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, and dated within three (3) months of the date of the request.

      (B) To assist in properly identifying requested records, the OGC and/or FOIA Office may request that the offender/defendant provide his/her DCDC or PDID number.

      (ii)  (A) A request for records made by an authorized representative of an offender/defendant will only be released with the subject's written authorization with appropriate releases. This authorization and releases must be dated within thirty (30) days of the date of the request letter and must be signed by the offender/defendant.

      (B) To assist in properly identifying requested records, the OGC and/or FOIA Office may request that the offender/defendant provided his/her DCDC or PDID number.

      (6) You must state in your request a firm agreement to pay the fees for search, duplication, and review as may ultimately be determined. The agreement may state the upper limit (but not less than $10.00) that the requester is willing to pay for processing the request. A request that fees be waived or reduced may accompany the agreement to pay fees and will be considered to the extent that such request is made in accordance with § 802.4(b) and provides supporting information to be measured against the fee waiver standard set forth in § 802.9(g). The requester shall be notified in writing of the decision to grant or deny the fee waiver. If a requester has an outstanding balance of search, review, or duplication fees due for FOIA request processing, the requirements of this paragraph (a)(6) are not met until the requester has remitted the outstanding balance due.

      (b) —(1)  You will be notified of the decision on the request within twenty (20) days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

      (i) The twenty (20) day period shall be tolled if:

      (A) The Agency needs clarification and/or more information from the requester; or

      (B) Clarification is needed with the requester regarding fee assessment.

      (C) The agency's receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request for information or clarification ends the tolling period.

      (ii) The twenty (20) day period shall be extended for ten (10) additional working days with written notice to the requester for unusual circumstances.

      (A) Unusual circumstances means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of particular requests—

      () The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

      () The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

      () The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

      (B) The written notice to the requester for unusual circumstances shall:

      () Notify the person making the request if the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified;

      () Provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request;

      () Make available the Agency's FOIA Public Liaison Officer, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester the Agency; and

      () Notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

      (iii) When the Agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, if the Agency can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the Agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the Agency may be allowed additional time to complete its review of the records.

      (A) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the term “exceptional circumstances” does not include a delay that results from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.

      (B) Refusal by a person to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request (or a modified request) after being given an opportunity to do so by the Agency to whom the person made the request shall be considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii).

      (2)  If it is determined that the request for records should be denied in whole or in part, the requester shall be notified by mail with a letter stating the basis for partial or whole denial. The letter of notification shall:

      (i) Be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee;

      (ii) State the exemptions relied on to not release the information;

      (A) Advise the requester of the reason of adverse determination and the right to administrative appeal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section;

      (B) Advise the right of such person to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison Officer of the agency; and

      (C) Advise the right of such person to seek assistance from the Office of Government Information Services;

      (iii) If technically feasible, indicate the amount of information deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made (unless providing such indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption relied upon to deny such material);

      (iv) If a document contains information exempt from disclosure, any reasonably segregable portion of the record will be provided to you after deletion of the exempt portions;

      (v) An agency shall—

      (A) Withhold information under this section only if—

      () The agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in paragraph (b) of this section; or

      () Disclosure is prohibited by law; and

      (B) Partially withhold information under this section only if—

      () Partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible; and

      () Take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information; and

      (vi) Nothing in this paragraph (b)(2) requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law, or otherwise exempted from disclosure by statute.

      (3)  If it is determined, after a thorough search for records by the responsible official or his delegate, that no records have been found to exist, the Chief FOIA Officer or his/her designee will so notify the requester in writing. The letter of notification will advise the requester of his or her right to administratively appeal within ninety (90) of the determination that no records exist ( to challenge the adequacy of the search for responsive records) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The response shall specify the official or office to which the appeal shall be submitted for review.

      (c)  (1) A requester may appeal an initial determination when:

      (i) Access to records has been denied in whole or in part;

      (ii) There has been an adverse determination of the requester's category as provided in § 802.10(d);

      (iii) Inadequacy of the FOIA search;

      (iv) A request for fee waiver or reduction has been denied; or

      (v) It has been determined that no responsive records exist.

      (2) Appeals must be made within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the letter with an adverse determination. Both the envelope and the letter of appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., 13th Floor, Washington, DC 20004 and must be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Appeal.”

      (3) The General Counsel will make an appeal determination within twenty (20) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the date of receipt of the appeal. However, for a good reason, this time limit may be extended up to an additional ten (10) days. If, after review, the General Counsel determines that additional information should be released, it will accompany the appeal response. If, after review, the General Counsel determines to uphold the initial review, we will inform you.

      § 802.7   Documents from other agencies.

#### § § 802.7

      (a)  (1) When a request for records includes a document that originated from another Federal agency, the document will be referred to the originating Federal agency for release determination, unless the information requested is for records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested, in which case CSOSA will release them without referral and/or consultation with the other federal agency. The requester will be informed of the referral. This is not a denial of a FOIA request; thus, no appeal rights accrue to the requester.

      (2) When a FOIA request is received for a record created by the Agency that includes information by another Federal agency, the record will be sent to the other Federal agency that has equities in the record. The consultation will request that the other Federal agency review and provide recommendations on disclosure. The Agency will not release any such record without prior consultation with the other Federal agency that has equities in the record.

      (b)  When a request for records includes a document from a non-Federal agency, CSOSA staff must make a release determination.

      (1) A release determination on the records from non-Federal agencies shall be analyzed on a case-by-case to determine if CSOSA or the non-Federal agency is best able to decide a record's sensitivity, and in turn its exemption status, in which case:

      (i) The requester will be re-routed to submit a separate FOIA request to the non-Federal agency; or

      (ii) CSOSA will consult with the non-Federal agency only if the non-Federal agency will provide a consultation within five (5) business days.

      (2) [Reserved]

      § 802.8   Expedited processing.

#### § § 802.8

      (a) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever CSOSA's FOIA Office determines that they involve:

      (1) Circumstances in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need.

      (i) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), the term “compelling need” means—

      (A) Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

      (B) A person is primarily engaged in disseminating information and the urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity.

      () With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information that affect public confidence, the requester must adequately explain the matter or activity and why it is necessary to provide the records being sought on an expedited basis.

      () A person “pr_i_marily engaged in disseminating information” does not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information.

      () The standard of “widespread and exceptional media interest” requires that the records requested pertain to a matter of current exigency to the American public and that delaying a response to a request for records would compromise a significant recognized interest to and throughout the general public. The requester must adequately explain the matter or activity and why it is necessary to provide the records being sought on an expedited basis.

      () [Reserved]

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) If a requester seeks expedited processing, the requester must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief. The statement must be in the form prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1746, “I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. Executed on [date].”

      (c) The determination as to whether to grant or deny the request for expedited processing will be made, and the requester notified, within ten (10) days after the date of the request. Because a decision to take a FOIA request out of order delays other requests, simple fairness demands that such a decision be made by the FOIA Public Liaison Officer only upon careful scrutiny of truly exceptional circumstances. The decision will be made solely based on the information contained in the initial letter requesting expedited processing.

      (d) Appeals of initial determinations to deny expedited processing must be made promptly. Both the envelope and the letter of appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., 12th Floor, Washington, DC 20004 and must be clearly marked “Expedited Processing Appeal.”

      (e) The OGC or his or designee will make an appeal determination regarding expedited processing as soon as practicable.

      § 802.9   Business information.

#### § § 802.9

      (a)  Business information provided to the Agency by a business submitter will be disclosed pursuant to the FOIA, unless exemptions and/or exclusions apply. Any claim of confidentiality must be supported by a statement by an authorized representative of the company providing specific justification that the information in question is in fact confidential commercial or financial information and has not been disclosed to the public.

      (b)  The Agency will provide a business submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a request or appeal encompassing its business information whenever required in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and except as is provided in paragraph (g) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions of records containing the business information.

      (c)  (1) Notice of a request for business information falling within paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section will be required for a period of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless the business submitter had requested, and provided acceptable justification for, a specific notice period of greater duration.

      (2) The Agency shall provide a business submitter with notice of receipt of a request or appeal whenever:

      (i) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as commercially or financially sensitive information; or

      (ii) The Agency has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

      (d)  (1) Through the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agency shall afford a business submitter ten (10) days from the date of the notice (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) to provide a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify why the business submitter believes the information is considered to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant to this paragraph might itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the requester shall be advised that such notice has been given to the submitter. The requester shall be further advised that a delay in responding to the request may be considered a denial of access to records and that the requester may proceed with an administrative appeal or seek judicial review, if appropriate. However, the requester will be invited to agree to a voluntary extension of time so that staff may review the business submitter's objection to disclose.

      (e)  The Agency will consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever a decision to disclose business information over the objection of a business submitter is made, the Agency shall forward to the business submitter a written notice which shall include:

      (1) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;

      (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and

      (3) A specified disclosure date which is not less than five (5) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the notice of the final decision to release the requested information has been mailed to the submitter.

      (f)  Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (c) of this section, the Agency shall promptly notify the business submitter.

      (g)  The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:

      (1) The Agency determines that the information shall not be disclosed;

      (2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).

      § 802.10   Fee schedule.

#### § § 802.10

      (a)  The fees described in this section conform to the Office of Management and Budget Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines. They reflect direct costs for search, review (in the case of commercial requesters), and duplication of documents, collection of which is permitted by the FOIA. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given below or for other reasons.

      (b)  The term  means those expenditures the agency actually makes in searching for, review (in the case of commercial requesters), and duplicating documents to respond to a FOIA request.

      (c)  Fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedule contained in paragraph (i) of this section for services rendered in responding to requests for records, unless any one of the following applies:

      (1) Services were performed without charge; or

      (2) The fees were waived or reduced in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (d)  Specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of the following categories of requesters:

      (1)  These requesters are assessed charges, which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of duplication of documents. Moreover, when a request is received for disclosure that is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Agency is not required to consider a request for a waiver or reduction of fees based upon the assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest. The Agency may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, or no records are located.

      (2)  Records shall be provided to requesters in these categories for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible, requesters must show that the request is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. These categories do not include requesters who want records for use in meeting individual academic research or study requirements.

      (3)  Records shall be provided to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.

      (4)  Requesters who do not fit any of the categories described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section shall be charged fees that will recover the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. The Agency may recover the cost of searching for records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, or no records are located. Requests from persons for records about themselves filed in a systems of records shall continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for duplication.

      (e)  Where the initial request includes a request for reduction or waiver of fees, the responsible official shall determine whether to grant the request for reduction or waiver before processing the request and notify the requester of this decision. If the decision does not waive all fees, the responsible official shall advise the requester of the fact that fees shall be assessed and, if applicable, payment must be made in advance pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

      (f)  (1) Fees may be waived or reduced on a case-by-case basis in accordance with this paragraph (f)(1) by the official who determines the availability of the records, provided such waiver or reduction has been requested in writing. Fees shall be waived or reduced by this official when it is determined, based upon the submission of the requester, that a waiver or reduction of the fees is in the public interest because furnishing the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Fee waiver/reduction requests shall be evaluated against the current fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice.

      (2) Appeals from denials of requests for waiver or reduction of fees shall be decided in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section by the official authorized to decide appeals from denials of access to records. Appeals shall be addressed in writing to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, Office of the General Counsel, 633 Indiana Avenue NW., 13th Floor, Washington, DC 20004 within thirty (30) days of the denial of the initial request for waiver or reduction and shall be decided within twenty (20) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays).

      (3) Appeals from an adverse determination of the requester's category as described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section shall be decided by the official authorized to decide appeals from denials of access to records and shall be based upon a review of the requester's submission and the Agency's own records. Appeals shall be addressed in writing to the office or officer specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Agency's determination of the requester's category and shall be decided within twenty (20) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays).

      (g)  (1) When the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed the limit set by the requester, and that amount is less than $250.00, the requester shall be notified of the estimated costs. The requester must provide an agreement to pay the estimated costs; however, the requester will also be given an opportunity to reformulate the request in an attempt to reduce fees.

      (2) If the requester has failed to state a limit and the costs are estimated to exceed $250.00, the requester shall be notified of the estimated costs and must pre-pay such amount prior to the processing of the request, or provide satisfactory assurance of full payment if the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees. The requester will also be given an opportunity to reformulate the request in an attempt to reduce fees.

      (h)  (1) Payment may be made by check or money order payable to the Treasury of the United States.

      (2) The Agency reserves the right to request prepayment after a request is processed and before documents are released in the following circumstances.

      (i) When costs are estimated or determined to exceed $250.00, the Agency shall either obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment of the estimated cost where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees or require the requester to make an advance payment of the entire estimated or determined fee before continuing to process the request.

      (ii) If a requester has previously failed to pay a fee within thirty (30) days of the date of the billing, the requester shall be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Agency begins to process a new request or the pending request. Whenever interest is charged, the Agency shall begin assessing interest on the 31st day following the day on which billing was sent. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

      (i)  The fees for services performed by an employee of the Agency shall be imposed and collected as set forth in this paragraph (i).

      (1)  All requesters, except commercial requesters, shall receive the first 100 pages duplicated without charge; the first two hours of search time free; or charge which total $10.00 or less. Fees for the copies are to be calculated as follows:

      (i) The duplication cost is calculated by multiplying the number of pages in excess of 100 by $0.25.

      (ii) Photographs, films, and other materials—actual cost of duplication.

      (iii) Other types of duplication services not mentioned above—actual cost.

      (iv) Material provided to a private contractor for copying shall be charged to the requester at the actual cost charged by the private contractor.

      (2)  The cost of search time is calculated by multiplying the number of quarter hours in excess of two hours by the following rates for the staff conducting the search:

      (i) $7.00 per quarter hour for clerical staff;

      (ii) $10.00 per quarter hour for professional staff; and

      (iii) $14.00 per quarter hour for managerial personnel.

      (3)  This means that the total cost must be greater than $10.00, either for the cost of the search (for time in excess of two hours), for the cost of duplication (for pages in excess of 100), or for both costs combined.

      (j)  The Agency shall charge for actual direct cost of the search, including computer search time, runs, and the operator's salary. The fee for computer output shall be actual direct costs. For requesters in the “all other” category, when the cost of the search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search ( the operator), the charge for the computer search will begin.

      (k)  When the Agency reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Agency shall aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.

      (l) The agency shall not assess any search fees (or in the case of an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or a representative of the news media—duplication fees) under this paragraph (l) if the agency has failed to comply with any time limit under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) and § 802.6(b)(1).

      (1) If an agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)) and the agency provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), a failure described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) is excused for an additional 10 days. If the agency fails to comply with the extended time limit, the agency may not assess any search fees (or in the case of a requester as described under this paragraph (l)(1), duplication fees).

      (2) If an agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, an agency may charge search fees (or in the case of a requester described under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, duplication fees) if the agency has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and the agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

      (3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist (as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C)), a failure described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      § 802.11   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 802.11

      The regulations in this subpart apply to all records which are contained in a system of records maintained by the Agency and which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier.

      (a) You can ask us whether we maintain records about you or obtain access to your records; and

      (b) You may seek to have your record corrected or amended if you believe that your record is not accurate, timely, complete, or relevant.

      § 802.12   Definitions.

#### § § 802.12

      As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

      (a)  has the meaning as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(e).

#### § § 802.13

      (a)  When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social security number.

      (b)  Information that concerns an individual and that is contained in a system of records maintained by the Agency shall not be disclosed to any person, or to another agency, except under the provisions of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

      (c)  Staff may disclose information from an agency system of records only if one or more of the following criteria apply:

      (1) With the written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains.

      (2) Pursuant to a specific exception listed under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)). For example, specific exceptions allow disclosure:

      (i) To employees within the Agency who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.

      (ii) If disclosure is required under FOIA when the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighs the privacy interest involved.

      (iii) For a routine use described in the agency system of records as published in the

      (A) The published notices for these systems describe the records contained in each system and the routine uses for disclosing these records without first obtaining the consent of the person to whom the records pertain.

      § 802.14   Requests for access to records.

#### § § 802.14

      (a)  (1) Requests for any agency record about yourself ordinarily will be processed pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Such a request must be made in writing and addressed to the FOIA Officer, Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20004. The requester should clearly mark on the face of the letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request.”

      (2) Your request will be considered received as of the date it is received by the Office of the General Counsel. For quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request.”

      (3) You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable Agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient and subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the more likely the Agency will be able to locate the records in response to your request. If a determination is made that your request does not reasonably describe records, the Agency will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. You will be given the opportunity to discuss your request so that you may modify it to meet the requirements of this section.

      (b)  Upon written request by an individual to gain access to his or her records which are not otherwise exempted, CSOSA shall permit the individual and, upon the individual's request, a person of his or her choosing to accompany him or her, to review the record and have a copy of all or any portion of the record. If a document contains information exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act, any reasonably segregable portion of the record will be provided to the requester after deletion of the exempt portions.

      (2) A requester will be notified of the decision on the request in writing.

      (3) Generally, all Privacy Act requests will be processed in the approximate order of receipt, unless the requester shows exceptional circumstances exist to justify an expedited response ( § 802.8).

      § 802.15   Denial of request.

#### § § 802.15

      (a)  If it is determined that the request for records should be denied in whole or in part, the requester shall be notified by mail. The letter of notification shall:

      (1) State the PA and FOIA exemptions relied on in not granting the request;

      (2) If technically feasible, indicate the amount of information deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made (unless providing such indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption relied upon to deny such material);

      (3) Set forth the name and title or position of the responsible official;

      (4) Advise the requester of the right to an administrative appeal in accordance with § 802.16; and

      (5) Specify the official or office to which such appeal shall be submitted.

      (b)  If it is determined, after a thorough search for records by the responsible official or his delegate, that no records have been found to exist, the responsible official will so notify the requester in writing. The letter of notification will advise the requester of the right to administratively appeal the determination that no records exist ( to challenge the adequacy of the search for responsive records) in accordance with § 802.16. The notification shall specify the official or office to which the appeal shall be submitted for review.

      § 802.16   Administrative appeal.

#### § § 802.16

      (a) A requester may appeal an Agency initial determination when:

      (1) Access to records has been denied in whole or in part; or

      (2) It has been determined that no responsive records exist.

      (b) Appeals of initial determinations must be made within 30 days of the receipt of the letter denying the request. Both the envelope and the letter of appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Room 1220, Washington, DC 20004 and must be clearly marked “Privacy Act Appeal.”

      (c) The General Counsel will make an appeal determination within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the date of receipt of the appeal. However, for a good reason, this time limit may be extended. If, after review, the General Counsel determines that additional information should be released, it will accompany the appeal response. If, after review, the General Counsel determines to uphold the initial review, we will inform you of that decision.

      § 802.17   Documents from other agencies.

#### § § 802.17

      (a)(1)  When a request for records includes a document from another Federal agency, the document will be referred to the originating Federal agency for a determination of its releasability. The requester will be informed of the referral. This is not a denial of a Privacy Act request; thus no appeal rights accrue to the requester.

      (2) When a Privacy Act request is received for a record created by the Agency that includes information originated by another Federal agency, the record will be referred to the originating agency for review and recommendation on disclosure. The Agency will not release any such record without prior consultation with the originating agency.

      (b)  When a request for records includes a document from a non-Federal agency, CSOSA staff must make a determination of its releasability.

      § 802.18   Correction or amendment of records.

#### § § 802.18

      This section applies to all records kept by the Agency except for records of earnings. If you believe your record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, you may request that your record be corrected or amended. A request for correction or amendment must identify the particular record in question, state the correction or amendment sought, and set forth the justification for the correction. To amend or correct your record, you should write to the Office of the General Counsel identified in § 802.14(a)(1). You should submit any available evidence to support your request. Both the request and the envelope must be clearly marked “Privacy Act Correction Request.” Your request should indicate:

      (a) The system of records from which the record is retrieved;

      (b) The particular record which you want to correct or amend;

      (c) Whether you want to add, delete or substitute information in the records; and

      (d) Your reasons for believing that your record should be corrected or amended.

      § 802.19   Appeal of denial to correct or amend.

#### § § 802.19

      (a) The system manager may grant or deny requests for correction of agency records. One basis for denial may be that the records are contained in an agency system of records that has been published in the  and exempted from the Privacy Act provisions allowing amendment and correction.

      (1) Any denial of a request for correction should contain a statement of the reason for denial and notice to the requester that the denial may be appealed to the General Counsel by filing a written appeal.

      (2) The appeal should be marked on the face of the letter and the envelope, “PRIVACY APPEAL—DENIAL OF CORRECTION,” and be addressed to the Office of the General Counsel, address cited at § 802.14(a)(1).

      (3) The General Counsel will review your request within 30 days from the date of receipt. However, for a good reason, this time limit may be extended. If, after review, the General Counsel determines that the record should be corrected, the record will be corrected.

We will make your statement available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with a statement of our reasons for refusing to amend the record.

      (b) Requests for correction of records prepared by other federal agencies shall be forwarded to that agency for appropriate action and the requester will be immediately notified of the referral in writing.

      (c) When the request is for correction of non-Federal records, the requester will be advised to write to that non-Federal entity.

      § 802.20   Accounting of disclosures.

#### § § 802.20

      (a) We will provide an accounting of all disclosures of a record for five years or until the record is destroyed, whichever is longer, except that no accounting will be provided to the record subject for disclosures made to law enforcement agencies and no accounting will be made for:

      (1) Disclosures made under the FOIA;

      (2) Disclosures made within the agency; and

      (3) Disclosures of your record made with your written consent.

      (b) The accounting will include:

      (1) The date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure; and

      (2) The name and address of the person or entity to whom the disclosure is made.

      (c) You may request access to an accounting of disclosures of your record. Your request should be in accordance with the procedures in § 802.14. You will be granted access to an accounting of the disclosures of your record in accordance with the procedures of this part which govern access to the related record, excepting disclosures made for an authorized civil or criminal law enforcement agency as provided by subsection (c)(3) of the Privacy Act. You will be required to provide reasonable identification.

      § 802.21   Appeals.

#### § § 802.21

      You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting to the Office of the General Counsel in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (See § 802.16) and the same procedures will be followed.

      § 802.22   Fees.

#### § § 802.22

      The Agency shall charge fees under the Privacy Act for duplication of records only. These fees shall be at the same rate the Agency charges for duplication fees under the Freedom of Information Act ( § 802.10(i)(1)).

      § 802.23   Use and disclosure of social security numbers.

#### § § 802.23

      (a)  An individual shall not be denied any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his or her social security number.

      (b)  The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply with respect to:

      (1) Any disclosure which is required by Federal statute, or

      (2) The disclosure of a social security number to any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.

      (c)  If the Agency requests an individual to disclose his or her social security account number, we shall inform that individual whether:

      (1) Disclosure is mandatory or voluntary.

      (2) By what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and

      (3) What uses will be made of it.

    Subpart D—Subpoenas or Other Legal Demands for Testimony or the Production or Disclosure of Records or Other Information

      § 802.24   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 802.24

      (a) These regulations state the procedures which the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (“CSOSA” or “Agency”) and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (“PSA” or “Agency”) follow in response to a demand from a Federal, state, or local administrative body for the production and disclosure of material in connection with a proceeding to which the Agency is not a party.

      (b) These regulations do not apply to congressional requests. Neither do these regulations apply in the case of an employee making an appearance solely in his or her private capacity in judicial or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Agency (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents, domestic relations, etc.).

      (c) This part is not intended and does not create and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States or specifically CSOSA or PSA.

      § 802.25   Definitions.

#### § § 802.25

      means a request, order, or subpoena for testimony or documents to use in a legal proceeding.

      includes a person employed in any capacity by CSOSA or PSA, currently or in the past; any person appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of the head of the Agency, or any Agency official, currently or in the past. A person who is subject to the Agency's jurisdiction or control includes any person who hired as a contractor by the agency, any person performing services for the agency under an agreement, and any consultant, contractor, or subcontractor of such person. A former employee is also considered an employee only when the matter about which the person would testify is one in which he or she was personally involved while at the Agency, or where the matter concerns official information that the employee acquired while working at the Agency, such as sensitive or confidential agency information.

      includes any pretrial, trial, and post-trial state of any existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative action, hearing, investigation, or similar proceeding before a court, commission, board, agency, or other tribunal, authority or entity, foreign or domestic. Legal proceeding also includes any deposition or other pretrial proceeding, including a formal or informal request for testimony made by an attorney or other person, or a request for documents gathered or drafted by an employee.

      § 802.26   Receipt of demand.

#### § § 802.26

      If, in connection with a proceeding to which the Agency is not a party, an employee receives a demand from a court or other authority for material contained in the Agency's files, any information relating to material contained in the Agency's files, or any information or material acquired by an employee as a part of the performance of that person's official duties or because of that person's official status, the employee must:

      (a) Immediately notify the Office of the General Counsel and forward the demand to the General Counsel if the demand pertains to CSOSA; or

      (b) Immediately notify the Deputy Director of PSA and forward the demand to the Deputy Director if the demand pertains to PSA.

      § 802.27   Compliance/noncompliance.

#### § § 802.27

      The General Counsel is responsible for determining if CSOSA should comply or not comply with the demand, and the Deputy Director of PSA is responsible for determining if PSA should comply with the demand.

      (a) An employee may not produce any documents, or provide testimony regarding any information relating to, or based upon Agency documents, or disclose any information or produce materials acquired as part of the performance of that employee's official duties, or because of that employee's official status without prior authorization from the General Counsel or Deputy Director. The reasons for this policy are as follows:

      (1) To conserve the time of the agency for conducting official business;

      (2) To minimize the possibility of involving the agency in controversial issues that are not related to the agency's mission;

      (3) To prevent the possibility that the public will misconstrue variances between personal opinions of agency employees and agency policies;

      (4) To avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes;

      (5) To preserve the integrity of the administrative process; and

      (6) To protect confidential, sensitive information and the deliberative process of the agency.

      (b) An attorney from the Office of the General Counsel shall appear with any CSOSA employee upon whom the demand has been made (and with any PSA employee if so requested by the Deputy Director), and shall provide the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this part. The attorney shall also inform the court or authority that the demand has been or is being referred for prompt consideration by the General Counsel or Deputy Director. The court or other authority will be requested respectfully to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions from the General Counsel or Deputy Director.

      (c) If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand pending receipt of instructions from the General Counsel or Deputy Director, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of the instructions from the General Counsel or Deputy Director not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee upon whom the demand was made shall respectfully decline to produce the information under  v.  340 U.S. 462 (1951). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a government employee could not be held in contempt for following an agency regulation requiring agency approval before producing government information in response to a court order.

      (d) To achieve the purposes noted in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section, the agency will consider factors such as the following in determining whether a demand should be complied with:

      (1) The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 522a;

      (2) Department of Health and Human Services statute and regulations concerning drug and alcohol treatment programs found at 42 U.S.C. 290dd and 42 CFR 2.1

      (3) The Victims Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 10606(b);

      (4) D.C. statutes and regulations;

      (5) Any other state or federal statute or regulation;

      (6) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;

      (7) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;

      (8) Whether disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative agency and the source or informant have no objection; and

      (9) Whether disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired.

    Subpart E—Exemption of Records Systems Under the Privacy Act

      § 802.28   Exemption of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency System—limited access.

#### § § 802.28

      The Privacy Act permits specific systems of records to be exempt from some of its requirements.

      (a)(1) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1)-(3), (4)(G)-(I), (5) and (8), (f) and (g):

      (i) Background Investigation (CSOSA-2).

      (ii) Supervision Offender Case File (CSOSA-9).

      (iii) Pre-Sentence Investigations (CSOSA-10).

      (iv) Supervision & Management Automated Record Tracking (SMART) (CSOSA-11).

      (v) Recidivism Tracking Database (CSOSA-12).

      (vi) [Reserved]

      (vii) Substance Abuse Treatment Database (CSOSA-15).

      (viii) Screener (CSOSA-16).

      (ix) Sex Offender Registry (CSOSA-18).

      (2) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

      (i) From subsection (c)(3) because offenders will not be permitted to gain access or to contest contents of these record systems under the provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. Revealing disclosure accountings can compromise legitimate law enforcement activities and CSOSA responsibilities.

      (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because exemption from provisions of subsection (d) will make notification of formal disputes inapplicable.

      (iii) From subsection (d), (e)(4)(G) through (e)(4)(I), (f) and (g) because exemption from this subsection is essential to protect internal processes by which CSOSA personnel are able to formulate decisions and policies with regard to offenders, to prevent disclosure of information to offenders that would jeopardize legitimate correctional interests of rehabilitation, and to permit receipt of relevant information from other federal agencies, state and local law enforcement agencies, and federal and state probation and judicial offices.

      (iv) From subsection (e)(1) because primary collection of information directly from offenders about criminal history or criminal records is highly impractical and inappropriate.

      (A) It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a criminal or other investigation.

      (B) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be established.

      (C) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence or information during an investigation, information could be obtained, the nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.

      (v) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other investigative activities is such that vital information about an individual can only be obtained from other persons who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning his/her own activities.

      (vi) From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the subject with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with investigative activities and could take appropriate steps to evade the investigation or flee a specific area.

      (vii) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing investigative interest.

      (viii) Those sections would otherwise require CSOSA to notify an individual of investigatory materials contained in a record pertaining to him/her, permit access to such record, permit requests for its correction (section 552a(d), (e)(4)(G), and (H)); make available to him/her any required accounting of disclosures made of the record (section 552a(c)(3)), publish the sources of records in the system (section 552a(4)(I)); and screen records to insure that there is maintained only such information about an individual as is relevant to accomplish a required purpose of the Agency (section 552(e)(1)). In addition, screening for relevancy to Agency purposes, a correction or attempted correction of such materials could require excessive amounts of time and effort on the part of all concerned.

      (b)(1) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1)-(e)(3), (4)(H), (5), (8) and (g):

      (i) Office of Professional Responsibility Record (OPR) (CSOSA-17).

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (2) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

      (i) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation, and reveal investigative interest by not only the OPR but also by the recipient agency. Since release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, release could result in activities that would impede or compromise law enforcement such as: the destruction of documentary evidence; improper influencing of witnesses; endangerment of the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; fabrication of testimony; and flight of the subject from the area. In addition, release of disclosure accounting could result in the release of properly classified information which could compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.

      (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.

      (iii) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system of records could provide the subject of an investigation with information concerning law enforcement activities such as that relating to an actual or potential criminal, civil or regulatory violation; the existence of an investigation; the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his activities; the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and information that may enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Such disclosure would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where they prevent the successful completion of the investigation; endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and/or lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

      (iv) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of the OPR for the following reasons:

      (A) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a civil, criminal or other law enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in which use is made of properly classified information. Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.

      (B) During the course of any investigation, the OPR may obtain information concerning actual or potential violations of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the OPR should retain this information as it may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity, and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.

      (C) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, information may be supplied to an investigator which relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may relate also to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated.

      (v) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law enforcement for the following reasons:

      (A) The subject of an investigation would be placed on notice as to the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.

      (B) In certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information relating to a subject's illegal acts, violations of rules of conduct, or any other misconduct must be obtained from other sources.

      (C) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a variety of sources other than the subject of the investigation in order to verify the evidence necessary for successful litigation.

      (vi) From subsection (e)(3) because the application of this provision would provide the subject of an investigation with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation. Providing such notice to a subject of an investigation could interfere with an undercover investigation by revealing its existence, and could endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and investigators by revealing their identities.

      (vii) From subsection (e)(5) because the application of this provision would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In the collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as an investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigation report, and thereby impede effective law enforcement.

      (viii) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation, and could reveal investigation techniques, procedures, and/or evidence.

      (ix) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.

      § 802.29   Exemption of the Pretrial Services Agency System.

#### § § 802.29

      The Privacy Act permits specific systems of records to be exempt from some of its requirements.

      (a)(1) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1)-(3), (4)(G)-(I), (5) and (8), (f) and (g):

      (i) Automated Bail Agency Database (ABADABA) (CSOSA/PSA-1).

      (ii) Drug Test Management System (DTMS) (CSOSA/PSA-2).

      (iii) Interview and Treatment Files (CSOSA/PSA-3).

      (iv) Pretrial Realtime Information Systems Manager (PRISM) (CSOSA/PSA-6).

      (2) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

      (i) From subsection (c)(3) because defendants/offenders will not be permitted to gain access or to contest contents of these record systems under the provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. Revealing disclosure accountings can compromise legitimate law enforcement activities and CSOSA/PSA responsibilities.

      (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because exemption from provisions of subsection (d) will make notification of formal disputes inapplicable.

      (iii) From subsection (d), (e)(4)(G) through (e)(4)(I), (f) and (g) because exemption from this subsection is essential to protect internal processes by which CSOSA/PSA personnel are able to formulate decisions and policies with regard to defendants/offenders, to prevent disclosure of information to defendants/offenders that would jeopardize legitimate correctional interests of rehabilitation, and to permit receipt of relevant information from other federal agencies, state and local law enforcement agencies, and federal and state probation and judicial offices.

      (iv) From subsection (e)(1) because primary collection of information directly from defendants/offenders about criminal history or criminal records is highly impractical and inappropriate.

      (A) It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a criminal or other investigation.

      (B) Relevancy and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be established.

      (C) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence or information during an investigation, information could be obtained, the nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.

      (v) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other investigative activities is such that vital information about an individual can only be obtained from other persons who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning his/her own activities.

      (vi) From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the subject with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with investigative activities and could take appropriate steps to evade the investigation or flee a specific area.

      (vii) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing investigative interest.

      (viii) Those sections would otherwise require CSOSA to notify an individual of investigatory materials contained in a record pertaining to him/her, permit access to such record, permit requests for its correction (section 552a(d), (e)(4)(G), and (H)); make available to him/her any required accounting of disclosures made of the record (section 552a(c)(3)), publish the sources of records in the system (section 552a(4)(I)); and screen records to insure that there is maintained only such information about an individual as is relevant to accomplish a required purpose of the Agency (section 552(e)(1)). In addition, screening for relevancy to Agency purposes, a correction or attempted correction of such materials could require excessive amounts of time and effort on the part of all concerned.

> [67 FR 54095, Aug. 21, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004]

    § 811.2   Applicability.

#### § § 811.2

    (a) Sex offender registration requirements apply to all persons who live, reside, work, or attend school in the District of Columbia, and who:

    (1) committed a registration offense on or after July 11, 2000;

    (2) committed a registration offense at any time and were in custody or under supervision on or after July 11, 2000;

    (3) were required to register under the law of the District of Columbia as was in effect on July 10, 2000; or

    (4) committed a registration offense at any time in another jurisdiction and, within the registration period (see §§ 811.5 and 811.6), entered the District of Columbia to live, reside, work or attend school.

    (b) “Committed a registration offense” means that a person was found guilty or found not guilty by reason of insanity of a registration offense or was determined to be a sexual psychopath. Registration offenses are defined in section 2(8) of the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999 (D.C. Official Code § 22-4001(8)), subject to the exceptions in section 17(b) of that Act (D.C. Official Code section 22-4016), and are listed descriptively in the Appendix to Part 811 (which also provides information on registration and notification classes). Any future revision to the statutory provisions designating registration offenses will be effective notwithstanding the timing of any conforming revision of these regulations, including the Appendix.

    § 811.3   Notice of obligation to register.

#### § § 811.3

    (a) Sex offenders may be notified of their obligation to register under various provisions of law. See sections 4, 6 and 8 of the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999 (D.C. Official Code sections 22-4003, 4005, 4007) (relating to notice by the District of Columbia Superior Court, Department of Corrections, or CSOSA); 18 U.S.C. 4042(c) (relating to notice by Federal Bureau of Prisons and probation offices); 18 U.S.C. 3563(a)(8), 3583(d), 4209(a) (inclusion of registration requirements as conditions of release under federal law); 42 U.S.C. 14071(b)(1) (notice under federal law standards for state sex offender registration programs).

    (b) In some cases, sex offenders may not be notified of their obligation to register. Lack of notice does not excuse a failure to register because sex offenders have an independent obligation to register. Persons who have been convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity of a sex offense or who have been determined to be a sexual psychopath should report to CSOSA in order to ascertain whether they are required to register.

    § 811.4   Determination of the obligation to register and the length of registration.

#### § § 811.4

    (a) If the Superior Court finds that a person committed a registration offense, the Superior Court enters an order certifying that the person is a sex offender and that the person is subject to registration for a prescribed period of time (see § 811.6).

    (b) If a court order has not been entered certifying that a person is a sex offender and that the person is subject to registration for a prescribed period of time, CSOSA makes those determinations. CSOSA also determines the notification classification if the Court has not done so. Facts on which CSOSA's determination may be based include:

    (1) The offense or offenses of conviction (or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity) or a determination that the person is a sexual psychopath;

    (2) For certain offenses, facts that may not be apparent on the face of the conviction (or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity), such as:

    (i) the age of the victim;

    (ii) whether force was involved; or

    (iii) whether the offense involved an undercover law enforcement officer who was believed to be an adult;

    (3) Prior criminal history;

    (4) For an offense committed in or prosecuted under the law of another jurisdiction, whether the offense involved conduct that was the same as or substantially similar to a District of Columbia registration offense; and

    (5) The amount of time that has elapsed as computed under § 811.6.

    § 811.5   Commencement of the obligation to register.

#### § § 811.5

    (a) A sex offender's obligation to register starts when the sex offender is found guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity of a registration offense or is determined to be a sexual psychopath. However, CSOSA may suspend registration requirements during any period of time in which a sex offender is detained, incarcerated, confined, civilly committed, or hospitalized in a secure facility.

    (b) A sex offender must register if the sex offender is placed on probation, parole, supervised release, or convalescent leave, is conditionally or unconditionally released from a secure facility, is granted unaccompanied grounds privileges or other unaccompanied leave, absconds or escapes, is otherwise not detained, incarcerated, confined, civilly committed, or hospitalized in a secure facility, or enters the District of Columbia from another jurisdiction to live, reside, work, or attend school. Registration shall be effectuated as provided in § 811.7 and may be carried out prior to the occurrence of a circumstance described in this paragraph, including the release of or granting of leave to a sex offender.

    § 811.6   Duration of the obligation to register.

#### § § 811.6

    (a)  The registration period for a sex offender who is required to register for life shall end upon the sex offender's death.

    (b)  (1) The registration period for any other sex offender shall end upon the expiration of the sex offender's probation, parole, supervised release, conditional release, or convalescent leave, or ten years after the sex offender is placed on probation, parole, supervised release, conditional release, or convalescent leave, or is unconditionally released from a correctional facility, prison, hospital or other place of confinement, whichever is latest.

    (2) In computing ten years, CSOSA will not count:

    (i) Any time in which the sex offender has failed to register or otherwise failed to comply with requirements of the Act or any procedures, requirements, rules, or regulations promulgated under the Act, including these regulations and the District of Columbia regulations;

    (ii) Any time in which a sex offender is detained, incarcerated, confined, civilly committed, or hospitalized in a mental health facility; and

    (iii) Any time in which a sex offender was registered prior to a revocation of probation, parole, supervised release, conditional release, or convalescent leave.

    (3) In computing ten years, CSOSA will count any time in which a sex offender was registered in another jurisdiction unless that time is not counted because of a circumstance set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (c)  A person's obligation to register terminates if the person's conviction, finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, or finding that the person is a sexual psychopath is reversed or vacated, or if the person has been pardoned for the offense on the ground of innocence, and the person has committed no other offenses for which registration is required.

    (d)  A sex offender's obligation to register in the District of Columbia terminates if the sex offender no longer lives, resides, works or attends school in the District of Columbia. However, the obligation to register in the District of Columbia resumes if the sex offender re-enters the District of Columbia within the registration period to live, reside, work or attend school.

    § 811.7   Initial registration.

    (3) CSOSA shall inform a sex offender of the sex offender's duty to:

    (i) Comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section for initial registration;

    (ii) Periodically verify the address(es) at which the sex offender lives, resides, works, and/or attends school, and other information, as provided in § 811.9;

    (iii) Report any change of address and any other changes in registration information (including changes in appearance), as provided in § 811.10;

    (iv) Notify CSOSA if the sex offender is moving to another jurisdiction or works or attends school in another jurisdiction and to register in any such jurisdiction; and

    (v) Comply with the requirements of the Act and any procedures, requirements, rules, or regulations promulgated under the Act, including these regulations and the District of Columbia regulations.

    (4) CSOSA shall inform the sex offender of the penalties for failure to comply with the sex offender's duties.

    (5) If the Superior Court has not entered an order certifying that a person is a sex offender, CSOSA shall inform the person that, if the person disagrees with CSOSA's determination that the person must register or CSOSA's determination of the person's classification for purposes of registration or notification, then the person must follow the review procedures set forth in § 811.8. CSOSA shall provide the person with a form to notify CSOSA of an intent to seek such review.

    § 811.8   Review of determination to register.

#### § § 811.8

Official Code § 22-4004(a)(1)), by:

    (1) Immediately providing CSOSA with a notice of intent to seek review upon being informed of the determination; and

    (2) Within 30 calendar days of the date on which the person is informed of CSOSA's determination, filing a motion in the Superior Court setting forth the disputed facts and attaching any documents or affidavits upon which the person intends to rely.

    (b) A person who fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section may seek review of CSOSA's determination only in conformity with the limitations of section 5(a)(1) of the Act (D.C. Official Code Section 4004(a)(1)) and for good cause shown and to prevent manifest injustice by filing a motion in the Court within three years of the date on which the person is informed of CSOSA's determination.

  PART 812—COLLECTION AND USE OF DNA INFORMATION

### Part 812

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; Pub. L. 106-546 (114 Stat. 2726).

**Source:** Source: 67 FR 54100, Aug. 21, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

    § 812.1   Purpose.

#### § § 812.1

    The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (“CSOSA”) cooperates with other federal agencies to ensure that DNA samples from offenders are appropriately furnished to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) for DNA analysis. The results of the DNA analyses are to be included in the Combined DNA Index System (“CODIS”).

    § 812.2   Individuals subject to DNA collection.

#### § § 812.2

    CSOSA is responsible for collecting a DNA sample from each individual under its supervision who is, or has been, convicted of a qualifying District of Columbia Code offense. Qualifying District of Columbia Code offenses were designated by the Council of the District of Columbia in the “DNA Sample Collection Act of 2001.” CSOSA provides a listing of these offenses in the Appendix to this part. The list is presented for informational purposes only. Any future revision to the District of Columbia Code sections designating the qualifying offenses will be effective notwithstanding the timing of a conforming revision of the Appendix by CSOSA. CSOSA may choose not to collect a sample from an individual if it determines that CODIS already contains a DNA analysis for the individual.

    § 812.3   Coordination with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

#### § § 812.3

    (a) CSOSA will coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in order to obtain documentation regarding the collection of a DNA sample when the Federal Bureau of Prisons releases an inmate to CSOSA's supervision or as requested by CSOSA.

    (b) CSOSA shall provide the Federal Bureau of Prisons with documentation regarding the collection of a DNA sample from a District of Columbia Code offender when CSOSA returns the District of Columbia Code offender to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons or as requested by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

    § 812.4   Collection procedures.

#### § § 812.4

    (a) DNA samples will be collected, handled, preserved, and submitted to the FBI in accordance with FBI guidelines.

    (b) CSOSA has the authority to use such means as are reasonably necessary to collect a sample from an individual who refuses to cooperate in the collection of the sample. Unless CSOSA determines that there are mitigating circumstances, CSOSA will consider that an individual is refusing to cooperate if:

    (1) The individual is being ordered or transferred to CSOSA's supervision, but fails to report to CSOSA for collection of the sample within 15 business days of being sentenced to probation or being discharged from a correctional institution; or

    § 813.1   Overview of guidance development process.

#### § § 813.1

    (a) This part governs all Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) employees and contractors involved with all phases of implementing CSOSA guidance documents.

    (b) The procedures set forth in this part apply to all guidance documents, issued by all components of CSOSA and PSA.

    (c) For purposes of this part, “guidance document” means an agency statement of general applicability, intended to have future effect on the behavior of regulated parties, that sets forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue, or an interpretation of statute or regulation. Guidance documents do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. A guidance document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.

    (d) CSOSA may not cite, use, or rely on guidance documents that are rescinded, except to establish historical facts.

    (e) Guidance documents not posted on the Agencies' web portal are considered rescinded, and not in effect.

    (f) This part does not apply to:

    (1) Rules promulgated pursuant to notice and comment under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, or similar statutory provisions;

    (2) Rules exempt from rulemaking requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(a);

    (3) Rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice;

    (4) Decisions of agency adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 or similar statutory provisions;

    (5) Internal executive branch legal advice or legal advisory opinions addressed to executive branch officials;

    (6) Agency statements of specific applicability, including advisory or legal opinions directed to particular parties about circumstance-specific questions ( case or investigatory letters responding to complaints, warning letters), notices regarding particular locations or facilities ( guidance pertaining to the use, operation, or control of a government facility or property), and correspondence with individual persons or entities ( congressional correspondence), except documents ostensibly directed to a particular party but designed to guide the conduct of the broader regulated public;

    (7) Legal briefs, other court filings, or positions taken in litigation or enforcement actions;

    (8) Agency statements that do not set forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue or an interpretation of a statute or regulation, including speeches and individual presentations, editorials, media interviews, press materials, or congressional testimony that do not set forth for the first time a new regulatory policy;

    (9) Guidance pertaining to military or foreign affairs functions;

    (10) Grant solicitations and awards;

    (11) Contract solicitations and awards; or

    (12) Purely internal agency policies or guidance directed solely to the Agencies' employees or contractors or to other Federal agencies that are not intended to have substantial future effect on the behavior of regulated parties.

    § 813.2   Guidance management process for CSOSA.

#### § § 813.2

    All CSOSA guidance documents, as defined in § 813.1, require review and clearance in accordance with this section. CSOSA's guidance documents are created through the Office of Policy Analysis (OPA), and come in two primary forms, policy statements and procedures (also known as operating instructions). This section sets forth the process for review and clearance for each.

    (a) Policy statements are:

    (1) Prepared by CSOSA components and issued under the Director's signature;

    (2) Remain in effect and active until rescinded, amended, or superseded;

    (3) Are reviewed by all CSOSA Associate Directors or their designees;

    (4) Are prepared using a standard format provided by the Office of Policy Analysis (OPA);

    (5) Are developed and maintained using a four-stage process that includes planning, development, review, and maintenance, each stage taking place within specified timeframes; and

    (6) Are reviewed and re-certified biennially.

    (b) Procedures are:

    (1) Coordinated through OPA;

    (2) Evaluated to prevent the issuance of duplicative or conflicting procedures;

    (3) Tied to a policy statement;

    (4) Developed in a collaborative process that addresses all relevant stakeholders' input;

    (5) Organized so that critical information is readily accessible and staff know how and where to find any related information; and

    (6) Maintained in an archive system to ensure future decision-makers have adequate information regarding the basis for previous procedure determinations.

    (c) The CSOSA Director, or his/her designee, may waive or truncate the internal policy development process where good cause exists, for example where Congress or the executive branch mandates changes.

    (d) CSOSA will notify OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) regularly of upcoming guidance documents. Notification will include a list of planned guidance documents, including summaries of each guidance document and the agency's recommended designation of “not significant” or “significant” as defined in § 813.7.

    (e) CSOSA will seek significance determinations for guidance documents from OIRA. Where CSOSA preliminarily finds the guidance document to be significant, prior to publishing, CSOSA will provide the document to OIRA for review to determine if it meets the definition of “significant” under E.O. 13891.

    § 813.3   Requirements for clearance of CSOSA guidance documents.

#### § § 813.3

    CSOSA's review and clearance of guidance documents, including policy and procedures, occurs according to the stages set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

    (a) —(1)  The CSOSA component coordinates with OPA to initiate the process.

    (2)  The CSOSA component provides the operational details and OPA will conduct the analysis and coordination and then prepare the initial document.

    (3)  The multi-layered review involves the Associate Directors, other CSOSA components and Employee Labor Relations (ELR), if appropriate. Upon completion, the Director reviews and signs the document for implementation.

    (4)  The Office of Information Technology (OIT) posts the signed policies to CSOSA's intranet and/or public-facing web portal, and OPA maintains the central repository of all signed policies and associated working files and initiates the biennial review.

    (b) —(1)  The CSOSA component submits a request to OPA for a new OI or an update to an existing OI;

    (2)  The CSOSA component prepares the content for the initial draft, which OPA reviews and affects any necessary coordination across CSOSA.

    (3)  The initial draft OI is submitted simultaneously to CSOSA Associate Directors, the Supervisory Policy Analyst, and Office of the Director for review. If applicable, notice is provided to union representatives; and upon clearance and approvals it is submitted to the Director for review, signature, and implementation.

    (4)  The Office of Information Technology (OIT) posts the signed OI to CSOSA's intranet and/or public-facing web portal; OPA maintains the central repository of all signed OI and associated working files and initiates the biennial review.

    § 813.4   Guidance development process for Pretrial Services Agency (PSA).

#### § § 813.4

    Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), an independent agency within CSOSA, has its own guidance or policy development process, coordinated through PSA's Office of Planning, Policy, and Analysis (OPPA). PSA's guidance development process occurs as detailed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:

    (a) PSA's guidance documents are:

    (1) Prepared by the responsible PSA Office and issued with the PSA Director's signature;

    (2) Remain in effect and active until rescinded, amended, or superseded;

    (3) Reviewed by all PSA Deputy Assistant Directors and/or designees;

    (4) Prepared using a standard format provided by OPPA; and

    (5) Developed using a process that includes planning, development, review, and maintenance in accordance with specified timeframes.

    (b) PSA process and procedure documents are:

    (1) Coordinated with assistance from OPPA, as appropriate, to avoid duplicative or conflicting procedures;

    (2) Tied to a policy, when appropriate;

    (3) Developed in collaboration with all stakeholders including the bargaining unit;

    (4) Organized in a manner that is readily accessible by those who need it; and

    (5) Maintained according to records management standards.

    (c) The PSA Director, or his/her designee, may waive or truncate the internal development process where good cause exists, for example where Congress or the executive branch mandates changes within a specified period or allow changes that need to be implemented immediately.

    (d) The process set forth in § 813.2(d) and (e) also applies to PSA guidance documents.

    § 813.5   Required elements of guidance documents.

#### § § 813.5

    CSOSA and PSA will ensure each guidance document:

    (a) Complies with all relevant statutes and regulations;

    (b) Identifies or includes:

    (1) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;

    (2) The component or division issuing the document;

    (3) The activities to which or the person to whom the document applies;

    (4) The date of issuance;

    (5) If it is a revision, the name/number of the guidance document it replaces;

    (6) The title of the guidance and the document identification number;

    (7) Citation(s) to the statutory provision or regulation to which it applies or interprets;

    (8) A disclaimer stating: “The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.”; and

    (9) A short summary of the subject matter covered in the guidance document, at the top of the document.

    § 813.6   Public access to and notification of effective guidance documents.

#### § § 813.6

    CSOSA and PSA will:

    (a) Ensure that all effective guidance documents are:

    (1) Identified by a unique identifier which includes, at a minimum, the document's title and date of issuance or revision;

    (2) Located on its web portal in a single, searchable, indexed database; and

    (3) Available to the public.

    (b) Note on the agency web portal that guidance documents lack the force and effect of law, except as authorized by law or as incorporated into a contract.

    (c) Maintain and advertise on its web portal a means for the public to comment electronically on any guidance documents that are subject to the notice and comment procedures and to submit requests electronically for issuance, reconsideration, modification, or rescission of guidance documents in accordance with § 813.9.

    § 813.7   Definition of “significant guidance document”.

#### § § 813.7

    For purposes of this part, “significant guidance document” means a guidance document that will be disseminated to regulated entities or the general public and that may reasonably be anticipated:

    (a) To lead to an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the U.S. economy, a sector of the U.S. economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;

    (b) To create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another Federal agency;

    (c) To alter materially the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

    (d) To raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866, as further amended.

    § 813.8   Significant guidance documents.

#### § § 813.8

    (a) Though not legally binding, some agency guidance may result in a substantial economic impact. For example, the issuance of agency guidance may induce private parties to alter their conduct or conform to recommended standards of practices, thereby incurring costs beyond the costs of complying with existing statutes and regulations.

    (b) If there is a reasonable possibility the guidance may be considered “significant” within the meaning of § 813.7 or if the Agencies are uncertain whether the guidance may qualify as such, the Agencies must receive OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) approval before issuance, unless the Agencies and OIRA agree that exigency, safety, health, or other compelling cause warrants an exemption from some or all requirements.

    (c) When an agency is assessing or explaining whether it believes a guidance document is significant, it should, at a minimum, provide the same level of analysis that would be required for a major determination under the Congressional Review Act.

    (d) The following will apply to significant guidance documents:

    (1) A period of public notice and comment of at least 30 days before the issuance of a final guidance document, and a public response from the Agencies to major concerns raised in comments. If the Agencies, for good cause, find that the notice and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, then no period of public comment will be provided, with notification and consultation with OIRA;

    (2) Approval by the respective Agency Director;

    (3) Review by OIRA under Executive Order 12866 before issuance;

    (4) Compliance with the applicable requirements for regulations or rules, including significant regulatory actions, set forth in E.O. 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), E.O. 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), E.O. 13609 (Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation), E.O. 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs), and E.O. 13777 (Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda).

    § 813.9   Petitions for withdrawal or modification of guidance.

#### § § 813.9

    Any person may petition CSOSA or PSA to withdraw or modify a particular guidance document. A person may make a request by accessing the respective agency guidance web portal or by writing a letter to the respective Agencies. The Agencies' portals allow an individual to provide his or her contact information and guidance-related requests. The Agencies will respond in a timely manner, but no later than 90 days after receipt of the request.

    (b) The Director, as defined in § 814.2, will retain evidence of service indicating the date of mailing of the notice.

    § 814.6   Petitions for hearing.

#### § § 814.6

    (a) To request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the offset schedule established by the Agency, the employee must send a written petition to the office designated in the notice of intent to offset, see § 814.5(a)(9), within 15 days of receipt of the deduction notice, stating why the employee believes the determination of the Agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt is in error or requesting changes to the proposed deduction frequency and amount.

    (b) The petition must:

    (1) Be signed by the employee;

    (2) Fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support the employee's position; and

    (3) Specify whether an oral or paper (documentary) hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.

    § 814.7   Petitions for hearing made after time expires.

#### § § 814.7

    (a) If the petition for hearing is filed after the 15-day period provided for in § 814.6, the Director may grant the request if the employee can establish that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control, or that the employee failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.

    (b) An employee waives the right to a hearing, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the offset schedule established by the Agency, if the employee:

    (1) Fails to file a timely request for a hearing, unless such failure is excused; or

    (2) Fails to appear at an oral hearing, of which the employee was notified, unless the hearing official determines that the failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

    (c) The following procedure is instituted upon a failure to appear at a hearing.

    (1) In the absence of good cause shown ( illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this part, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent.

    (2) If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled and make a determination based upon oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date, and both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.

    § 814.8   Representation at the hearing.

#### § § 814.8

    (a) The creditor agency may be represented by legal counsel.

    (b) The employee may be self-represented or may be represented by an individual of the employee's choosing, at the employee's expense.

    § 814.9   Procedures for hearing and final decisions.

#### § § 814.9

    (a) —(1)  After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be a review of the written record, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit evidence and arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date, after which the record shall be closed. The date specified shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.

    (2)  An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing, if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone ( when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). Where an oral hearing is appropriate, the hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing,  the rules of evidence do not apply. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:

    (i) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and arguments;

    (ii) Informal meetings in which the hearing official interviews the employee; or

    (iii) Formal written submissions with an opportunity for oral presentations.

    (3)  If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the hearing official will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record.

    (4)  The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing conducted under this part. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.

    (b) —(1)  The hearing officer shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the hearing petition was received by the creditor agency, unless the employee requested a delay in the proceedings, in which case the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.

    (2)  The written decision shall include:

    (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

    (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions, including a determination whether the employee's petition for hearing was baseless and resulted from an intent to delay creditor agency collection activity; and

    (iii) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.

    § 814.10   Method and source of deductions.

#### § § 814.10

    (a)  Unless the debtor employee and the Director have agreed to an alternative repayment arrangement under § 814.9, a debt shall be collected in lump sum or by installment deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account.

    (b)  Ordinarily, the size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any pay period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount, as outlined in § 814.10(c) and/or a higher deduction has been ordered by a court under section 124 of Public Law 97-276 (96 Stat. 1195).

    (c) —(1)  If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the debt generally will be collected in one lump-sum deduction.

    (2)  If the employee is deemed financially unable to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the debt shall be collected in installments. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active duty or employment.

    (d)  (1) Deductions will begin on the date stated in the notice of intent, unless an alternative repayment agreement under § 814.9 has been accepted or the employee has filed a timely request for a hearing.

    (2) If the employee files a timely petition for hearing as provided in § 814.6, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing and a final written decision has been rendered in favor of the Agency.

    (e)  If an employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from subsequent payments of any nature ( final salary payment or lump-sum leave) due the employee from the paying agency as of the date of separation.

    (f)  If the debt cannot be satisfied by offset from any final payment due the employee on the date of separation, the Director will liquidate the debt, where appropriate, by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from later payments of any kind due the former employee ( lump sum leave payment).

    § 814.11   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

#### § § 814.11

    Debts owed to the Agency shall be assessed interest, penalties and administrative costs in accordance with FCCS, 31 CFR 901.9.

    § 814.12   Non-waiver of rights by payments.

#### § § 814.12

    An employee's involuntary payment, of all or any portion of a debt being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 must not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

    § 814.13   Refunds.

#### § § 814.13

    (a) CSOSA will promptly refund amounts paid or deducted under this subpart to the appropriate party, when:

    (1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing to the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or

    (2) The employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay.

    (b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law or contract.
