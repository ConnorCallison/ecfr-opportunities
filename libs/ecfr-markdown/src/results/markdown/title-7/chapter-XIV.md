        § 1400.104   Changes in farming operations.

#### § § 1400.104

        (a) Any change in a farming operation that would increase the number of persons to which the provisions of this part apply must be bona fide and substantive. If bona fide, the following will be considered to be a substantive change in the farming operation:

        (1) The addition of a family member to a farming operation in accordance with § 1400.208, except that the addition will not affect the status of any other person or legal entity that is added to the farming operation; or

        (2) With respect to a landowner only, a change from a cash rent to a share rent; or

        (3) An increase through the acquisition of land used for agricultural production not previously involved in the farming operation of at least 20 percent or more in the total land involved in the farming operation.

        (i) For the purpose of payment limitations, the increase in agricultural land will be considered an applicable bona fide and substantive change for the increase of only one person or legal entity to the farming operation, unless;

        (ii) A representative of the State FSA office determines, based on the magnitude and complexity of the change represented, the increase in agricultural land supports additional persons or legal entities to the farming operation; or

        (4) A change in ownership by sale or gift of equipment from a person or legal entity previously engaged in a farming operation to a person or legal entity that has not been involved in the operation. The sale or gift of equipment will be considered to be bona fide and substantive only if:

        (i) The transferred amount of the equipment is commensurate with the new person's or legal entity's share of the farming operation;

        (ii) The sale or gift of the equipment was based on the equipment's fair market value;

        (iii) The former owner of the equipment has no direct or indirect control over the equipment;

        (iv) The transaction was not financed by the former owner; and

        (v) Preference was not given to the former owner to re-purchase the equipment at a later date; or

        (5) A change in ownership by sale or gift of land or livestock from a person or legal entity who previously has been engaged in a farming operation to a person or legal entity that has not been involved in the operation. The sale or gift of land or livestock will be considered to be bona fide and substantive only if:

        (i) The transferred amount of the land or livestock is commensurate with the new person's or legal entity's share of the farming operation;

        (ii) The sale or gift of land or livestock was based on land's or livestock's fair market value;

        (iii) The former owner of the land or livestock has no direct or indirect control over the land or livestock;

        (iv) The transaction was not financed by the former owner; and

        (v) Preference was not given to the former owner to re-purchase the land or livestock at a later date.

        (b) Unless the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section are met, the increase in persons in the farming operation will not be recognized for payment limitation purposes and the additional persons or legal entities are not eligible for program payment identified in § 1400.1 otherwise resulting from the farming operation.

> [73 FR 79273, Dec. 29, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 899, Jan. 7, 2010; 85 FR 52038, Aug. 24, 2020]

        § 1400.105   Attribution of payments.

#### § § 1400.105

        (a) A payment made directly to a person or legal entity will be combined with the pro rata interest of the person or legal entity in payments received by a legal entity in which the person or legal entity has a direct or indirect ownership interest, unless the payments of the legal entity have been reduced by the pro rata share of the person or legal entity.

        (b) A payment made to a legal entity will be attributed to those persons who have a direct and indirect ownership interest in the legal entity, unless the payment of the legal entity has been reduced by the pro rata share of the person.

        (c) Attribution of payments made to legal entities will be tracked through four levels of ownership in legal entities as follows:

        (1) First level of ownership—any payment made to a legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by a person will be attributed to the person in an amount that represents the direct ownership interest in the first-tier or payment legal entity;

        (2)(i) Second level of ownership—any payment made to a first-tier legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by another legal entity (referred to as a second-tier legal entity) will be attributed to the second-tier legal entity in proportion to the ownership of the second-tier legal entity in the first-tier legal entity;

        (ii) If the second-tier legal entity is owned in whole or in part by a person, the amount of the payment made to the first-tier legal entity will be attributed to the person in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-tier legal entity by the person.

        (3) Third and fourth levels—except as provided in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, any payments made to a legal entity at the third and fourth tiers of ownership will be attributed in the same manner as specified in paragraph (2)(i) of this section.

        (4) Fourth-tier ownership—if the fourth-tier of ownership is that of a legal entity and not that of a person, a reduction in payment will be applied to the first-tier or payment legal entity in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-tier or payment legal entity by the fourth-tier legal entity.

        (d) For purposes of administering direct attribution, and to determine a person's  ownership interest in a legal entity that receives a payment subject to limitation; the ownership interest on June 1 of each year will be used.

        (1) If the change in ownership interest is due to the death of an interest holder in the legal entity or the legal entity did not exist on June 1 of the applicable year, the Deputy Administrator may determine that a change after June 1 is considered relevant or effective for the current year.

        (2) Changes that occur after June 1 cannot be used to increase the amount of program payments a legal entity, or its members, is eligible to receive directly or indirectly for the applicable year.

        (e) Direct attribution of payments is not applicable to a cooperative association of producers with respect to commodities produced by the members of the association that are marketed by the association on behalf of the members of the association. The payments will instead be attributed to the producers as persons.

        § 1400.106   Payment limits.

#### § § 1400.106

        (a) Direct or indirect payments made to a person or legal entity will not exceed the amounts specified in subpart A of this part and will be determined in accordance with § 1400.105.

        (b) Payments made to a joint operation cannot exceed, for each payment specified in subpart A of this part, the amount determined by multiplying the maximum payment amount specified in subpart A of this part by the number of persons and legal entities, other than joint operations, that comprise the ownership of the joint operation.

        (c) Payments made to a legal entity will be reduced proportionately by an amount that represents the direct or indirect ownership in the legal entity by any person or legal entity that has otherwise reached the applicable maximum payment limitation.

        If the person dies or is incapacitated before a determination is made that the person is “actively engaged in farming,” the representative of the deceased person's estate or the incapacitated person, or other person if necessary, must provide the determining authority information to verify that the person did make a conscious effort to and would have been determined to be actively engaged in farming if not for the person's death or incapacitation. If the person dies or is incapacitated after being determined to be “actively engaged in farming,” the determining authority will allow the determination to be in effect for that program year or fiscal year, as applicable. However, the following year the person or the person's estate must meet all necessary requirements in order to be determined to be “actively engaged in farming” for that year.

#### § § 1400.213

        If a person is called to active duty in the military before a determination is made that the person is actively engaged in farming, the person may be considered to be actively engaged in farming if the determining authority determines that the person did make a conscious effort to, and would have been determined to be, actively engaged in farming if the person would not have been called to active duty. If the person is called to active duty after being determined to be actively engaged in farming, the determination will remain in effect for the program year.

#### § § 1400.214

        (a) Any tenant that is actively engaged in farming in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and conducts a farming operation in which the tenant rents the land for cash, for a crop share guaranteed as to the amount of the commodity, or by any arrangement in which the tenant does not compensate the landlord by cash or a crop share, and receives benefits, with respect to the land under a program specified in § 1400.1(a)(1) and (2) will not be eligible to receive any payment with respect to the cash-rented land unless the tenant independently makes a significant contribution to the farming operation of:

        (1) Active personal labor; or

        (2) Significant contributions of both active personal management and equipment.

        (b) If the equipment is leased by the tenant from:

        (1) The landlord, then the lease must reflect the fair market value of the equipment leased with a payment schedule considered reasonable and customary for the area; or

        (2) The same person or legal entity that is providing hired labor to the farming operation, then the contracts for the lease of the equipment and for the hired labor must be two separate contracts.

        (c) If the equipment is leased by the tenant from the landlord, or from the same person or legal entity that is providing hired labor to the farming operation, then the tenant must exercise complete control over the leased equipment during the entire current crop year. Complete control is defined as exclusive access and use by the tenant.

        (d) If the cash rent tenant is a joint operation, then each member or their spouse must make a significant contribution of active personal labor or active personal management as specified in § 1400.203(a)(1)(ii) to be considered eligible for the member's share of the program payments received by the joint operation on the cash rented land.

      Subpart D [Reserved]

      Subpart E—Foreign Persons

        § 1400.401   Eligibility.

#### § § 1400.401

        (a) Subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101-1778) will be ineligible to receive any type of loans or payments made available under Title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714-714o), or subtitle D of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831-3836), or under any contract entered into under Title XII of that Act (16 U.S.C. 3801-3845), with respect to any commodity produced, or land set aside from production, on a farm that is owned or operated by the person, unless the person is an individual who is providing land, capital, and a substantial amount of personal labor in the production of crops on the farm. Likewise, and subject to the same conditions, such persons may be ineligible for payments under any other program which by its own regulations specifically provides for that ineligibility and adopts the regulations in this subpart.

        (b)(1) A corporation or other legal entity will be ineligible to receive payments, loans, and benefits if more than 10 percent of the ownership of the legal entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the United States or lawful aliens unless each foreign person who is a stockholder or other type of member provides a substantial amount of active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by the legal entity. However, upon the written request of the legal entity, the Deputy Administrator may make payments in an amount determined by the Deputy Administrator to be representative of the percentage interest of the legal entity that is owned by citizens of the United States and lawful aliens or foreign stockholders or other type of member who provide a significant contribution of active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by the legal entity.

        (2) In determining whether more than 10 percent of the ownership of a legal entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the United States or by lawful aliens, the ownership interest will be the higher of the amount of the interest on:

        (i) The date the applicable program contract or agreement is executed by the legal entity or

        (ii) Any other date prior to the final harvest date that is determined and announced by the Deputy Administrator to be normal in the area for the applicable program crop.

        (3) A corporation or other legal entity must inform the county committee of any increase in ownership that occurs after the applicable program contract or agreement is executed.

        (4) In the event of an increase in ownership after a payment, loan, or benefit has been made, the legal entity will refund the payment, loan, or benefit.

        (5) Where there is only one class of stock or other similar unit of ownership, a person's or legal entity's percentage share of the limited partnership, corporation, or other similar legal entity will be based upon the outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership held by the person or legal entity as compared to the total outstanding shares of stock or other similar unit of ownership. If the limited partnership, corporation, or other similar legal entity has more than one class of stock or other unit of ownership, the percentage share of the limited partnership, corporation or other similar legal entity owned by a person or legal entity will be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of market quotations. If market quotations are unavailable or so infrequent that they do not represent fair market value, the percentage share will be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors affecting the fair market value of the stock or other unit of ownership, including the various rights and privileges that are attributed to each the class.

        (c) A citizen of the United States, lawful alien, or legal entity that is not subject to this part who is in lawful possession, through a lease or otherwise, of a farm owned by a person or legal entity who is subject to this part may receive a payment, loan, and benefit without regard to this part.

        § 1400.402   Notification.

#### § § 1400.402

        (a) Any legal entity, whether foreign or domestic, that executes a program contract or agreement under which a payment, loan, or benefit may be available must provide written notification to the county committee in the county where the legal entity conducts its farming operation if:

        (1) Any person, group of persons, legal entity, or group of legal entities holds more than a 10 percent interest in the legal entity; and

        (2) The person, group of persons, legal entity, or group of legal entities, in accordance with § 1400.401, are ineligible to receive a payment, loan, or benefit.

        (b) Written notification must include the name and social security number or taxpayer identification number of the a person or legal entity, if known, and of all persons and legal entities that hold an interest in the legal entity.

        (c) The failure of the legal entity to provide this information will result in the ineligibility of the legal entity to receive any payment, loan, or benefit.

      Subpart F—Average Adjusted Gross Income Limitation

        § 1400.500   Applicability.

#### § § 1400.500

        (a) A person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, will not be eligible to receive, directly or indirectly, certain program payments or benefits described in § 1400.1 if the average adjusted gross income of the person or legal entity exceeds $900,000 for the 3 taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (b) Determinations made under this subpart for conservation programs are:

        (1) Applicable starting with the 2015 fiscal year, except for AMA which is applicable with the 2014 fiscal year;

        (2) Based on the year for which the conservation program contract or agreement is approved; and

        (3) Applicable for the entire term of the subject agreement or contract.

        (c) Vendors that receive payment for technical services provided in conjunction with programs made subject to this subpart by regulation or statute, but who are not beneficiaries of the program, are not subject to this subpart for services that are of the type that are also performed by the Federal Government in connection with the programs.

        (d) Payments to an escrow agent, or other legal entity of similar capacity in which the recipient is maintaining temporary custody of the funds for eventual disbursement to an eligible program participant, are not subject to this subpart so long as the party ultimately receiving the payment is eligible under this subpart.

        (e) Payments to States, counties, political subdivisions and agencies thereof, and Indian tribes as defined in § 1400.3 are not subject to this subpart.

        (f) The Administrator or NRCS Chief may waive the limitation under this section on a case-by-case basis for the protection of environmentally sensitive land of special significance. A waiver request must be in writing and:

        (1) Show that use of conservation program funding on or adjacent to environmentally sensitive land of special significance is critical to the success of a project that provides conservation benefits to multiple producers or landowners in a community, watershed, or other geographic area;

        (2) Demonstrate that the proposed action achieves enduring protection of environmentally sensitive land of special significance through use of a long-term agreement that is greater than 15 years in duration or through use of a deed restriction on the land; or

        (3) Present evidence that otherwise demonstrates, as determined by the Administrator or the NRCS Chief, that the waiver is necessary to address the critical natural resources referenced in the definition of environmentally sensitive land of special significance.

        § 1400.501   Determination of average adjusted gross income.

#### § § 1400.501

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, average adjusted gross income means:

        (1) For a person filing a separate tax return, the amount reported as “adjusted gross income” on the final federal income tax return for the person for the applicable tax year;

        (2) For a person filing a joint tax return, the amount reported as “adjusted gross income” on the final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year unless a certified statement is provided by a certified public accountant or attorney specifying the manner in which the income would have been declared and reported if the persons had filed two separate returns and that this calculation is consistent with the information supporting the filed joint return;

        (3) For a corporation, including a subchapter S corporation, the total reported “taxable income” as reported to the Internal Revenue Service plus the amount of the charitable contributions as reported on the final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year;

        (4) For a tax exempt legal entity, the “unrelated business taxable income” of the legal entity as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the final federal income tax return, less any other income CCC determines to be from non-commercial activities;

        (5) For a limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or similar type of organization, the income from trade or business activities plus the amount of guaranteed payments to the members as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year; and

        (6) For an estate or trust, the adjusted total income plus charitable deductions as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the final federal income tax return for the applicable tax year, or the amount of net increase in the estate's or trust's value resulting from its business or investment interests.

        (b) For purposes of applying this subpart and calculating the 3-year average referenced in § 1400.500, that average will be for the adjusted gross income for the 3 taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by CCC. For a legal entity that is not required to file a federal income tax return, or a person or legal entity that did not have taxable income in one or more tax years, the average will be the adjusted gross income, including losses, averaged for the 3 taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by CCC. A new legal entity will have its adjusted gross income averaged only for those years of the base period for which it was in business; however, a new legal entity will not be considered “new” to the extent it takes over an existing operation and has any elements of common ownership or interests with the preceding legal entity, or with persons or legal entities with an interest in the “old” legal entity. When there is this  commonality, income of the “old” legal entity will be averaged with that of the “new” legal entity for the base period.

        § 1400.502   Compliance and enforcement.

#### § § 1400.502

        (a) To comply with the average adjusted gross income limitation, a person or legal entity, including all interest holders in a legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture, must provide annually the following as required by CCC:

        (1) A certification in the manner prescribed by CCC from a certified public accountant or attorney that the average adjusted gross income of the person or legal entity does not exceed the applicable limitation;

        (2) A certification from the person or legal entity that the average adjusted gross income of the person or legal entity does not exceed the applicable adjusted gross income limitations;

        (3) The relevant Internal Revenue Service documents and supporting financial data as requested by CCC. Supporting financial data may include State income tax returns, financial statements, balance sheets, reports prepared for or provided to another Government agency, information prepared for a private lender, and other credible information relating to the amount and source of the person's or legal entity's income;

        (4) Authorization for CCC to obtain tax data from the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of verification of compliance with this subpart.

        (b)(1) All persons and legal entities are subject to an audit by FSA of any information submitted in accordance with this subpart. As a part of this audit, income tax returns may be requested, and if requested, must be supplied by all related persons and legal entities.

        (2) In addition to any other requirement under any Federal statute, relevant Federal income tax returns and documentation must be retained a minimum of two years after the end of the calendar year corresponding to the year for which payments or benefits are requested.

        (c) Failure to comply with this subpart's requirements, will result in ineligibility for all program benefits subject to this subpart for the year or years subject to the request.

        § 1400.503   Commensurate reduction.

#### § § 1400.503

        (a) Any program payment or benefit subject to this subpart provided to a legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture will be reduced by an amount commensurate with the direct and indirect ownership interest in the legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture of each person or legal entity determined to have an average adjusted gross income in excess of the applicable limitation under the standards provided elsewhere in this subpart for the direct recipient of the payments.

        (b) Ownership interest in a legal entity will be reviewed to the fourth level of ownership, as specified in § 1400.105, to determine whether a commensurate reduction is applicable and the extent of the reduction. If an ownership interest is not held by a person in the fourth level of ownership in a legal entity, no payment or benefit will be made with respect to the interest.

#### § § 1400.602

        (a) If a farming operation includes any nonfamily members as specified under the provisions of § 1400.201(b)(2) and (3) and the farming operation is seeking to qualify more than one person as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, then:

        (1) Each person must maintain contemporaneous records or logs as specified in § 1400.603; and

        (2) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, if the farming operation seeks not more than one additional person to qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, because the operation is large, then the operation may qualify for one  additional person if the farming operation:

        (i) Produces and markets crops on 2,500 acres or more of cropland;

        (3) If the farming operation seeks not more than one additional person to qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, because the operation is complex, then the operation may qualify for one additional person if the farming operation is determined by the FSA state committee as complex after considering the factors described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. Any determination that a farming operation is complex by an FSA state committee must be reviewed and DAFP must concur with that determination for it to be implemented. To demonstrate complexity, the farming operation will be required to provide information to the FSA state committee on the following:

        (i) Number and type of livestock, crops, or other agricultural products produced and marketing channels used; and

        (ii) Geographical area covered.

        (b) FSA state committees may adjust the limitations described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section up or down by not more than 15 percent if the FSA state committee determines that the relative size of farming operations in the state justify making a modification of either or both of these limitations. If the FSA state committee seeks to make a larger adjustment, then DAFP will review and may approve the request.

        (c) If a farming operation seeks to qualify a total of three persons as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, then the farming operation must demonstrate both size and complexity as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) In no case may more than three persons in the same farming operation qualify as providing a significant contribution of active personal management, or a significant contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, as defined by this subpart.

        (e) A person's contribution of active personal management, or the contribution of the combination of active personal labor and active personal management, to a farming operation specified in § 1400.601(b) will only qualify one member of that farming operation as actively engaged in farming as defined in this part. Other individual persons in the same farming operation are not precluded from making management contributions, except that the contributions will not be recognized as meeting the requirements of being a significant contribution of active personal management.

Such agreements may include a provision which allows a producer to make available for the use of the cooperative the value of the non-cash payment which would otherwise be made to the producer.

      § 1401.3   Payments to persons with outstanding CCC loans.

#### § § 1401.3

      (a) Persons with outstanding CCC loans who are eligible to receive payments from CCC, including a person authorized to receive a payment on behalf of another person, may be required to liquidate such loans in accordance with this section in order to be eligible to receive a payment authorized by § 1470.2.

      (b) A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise agreed upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which would otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than one outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise, prescribe which loan collateral the person shall be required to redeem in order to receive payment. The purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not include the amount of any unearned advance storage payments received with respect to the redeemed collateral. After redemption and the subsequent sale to CCC of the commodity pledged as collateral for such CCC loan, CCC shall make available to the person a like quantity of the commodity.

      § 1401.4   Commodity certificates.

#### § § 1401.4

      (a)  CCC may issue commodity certificates as a form of payment. Commodity certificates will bear a dollar denomination. Such certificate may be transferred, exchanged for the inventory of CCC (including the receipt in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section of loan collateral by a person to whom a loan secured by such collateral is made): or exchanged for cash, as provided for in this section. Commodity certificates shall be subject to the provisions of this part, and to any terms, conditions and restrictions provided on the certificate, which are incorporated by reference herein.

      (b)  (1) The provisions of this section or the commodity certificates shall take precedence over any state statutory or regulatory provisions which are inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with the provisions of the commodity certificates.

      (2) Commodity certificates shall not be subject to any lien, encumbrance, or other claim or security interest, except that of an agency of the United States Government arising specifically under Federal statute.

      (3) The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall apply without regard to the identity of the holder of the certificate.

      (c)  Any person may transfer a commodity certificate to any other person. However, any such transfer must be in the full amount of the certificate, and can be effected only by restrictive endorsement on the back of the certificate, showing the name of the transferee and the date of the transfer, and signed by the transferor. CCC will not honor any certificate bearing any endorsement to “bearer” or any other nonrestrictive endorsement, or otherwise transferred in a manner contrary to the regulations contained in this section. The person who submits a commodity certificate to CCC shall endorse the certificate to CCC.

      (d) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity certificate may exchange such certificate, by itself or together with other commodity certificates, for such commodities as are made available by CCC by endorsing and submitting the certificate to CCC. If a person submits commodity certificates for exchange in order that the person would be eligible to receive a quantity of a commodity which includes less than an entire unit in which the commodity is stored (e.g., less than an entire bale of cotton or an entire barrel of honey): (i) Such person may forfeit the partial unit of the commodity to CCC, or (ii) CCC may issue a check to such person for the partial unit of the commodity or permit such person to purchase the remainder of such unit at a price determined by CCC. A person may obtain information regarding commodities available for exchange and the procedure for exchange from Kansas City Commodity Office, FSA-USDA, Kansas City, MO 64141-0205.

      (2)  A holder of an amount of commodity certificates sufficient to acquire a carload lot, or other quantity as may be determined by CCC, may present such amount for exchange at any time on or before the expiration date of such certificates. A holder who is permitted to exchange the certificate for CCC-owned commodities but who does not possess commodity certificates in the amount specified in the preceding sentence may, not to exceed once during a calendar month, submit such certificates to CCC. CCC will, at CCC's option, pay such holder by check in the amount of the certificate or transfer to such holder title to commodities owned by CCC.

      (3)  CCC may require or permit holders of commodity certificates to exchange such certificates for commodities owned by CCC which are stored by such holder, without making such commodities or kinds of commodities available to other holders of commodity certificates.

      (4)  Except as otherwise may be announced by CCC, CCC will determine the value of CCC-owned commodities made available to holders of commodity certificates.

      (5)  Title to commodities owned by CCC which are transferred to a person who submits commodity certificates to CCC shall be transferred in store, except as may be determined and announced by CCC. The person who submits certificates to CCC shall be responsible for all costs incurred in transferring title to the commodity, except as specifically provided by CCC. The transfer of title to such commodities shall occur without regard to any State law or any claim of lien against the commodity or proceeds thereof which may be asserted by any creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises specifically under Federal statute.

      (6)  CCC may, at its option, discount or refuse to accept any commodity certificate presented for exchange after the expiration date stated on the certificate.

      (e) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, any holder of a commodity certificate may use such certificate to receive commodities pledged as collateral for CCC loans made to such person, at any time on or before the expiration date stated on the certificate. A holder of a commodity certificate who wishes to receive a quantity of a commodity pledged by such person as collateral for a CCC loan in exchange for a certificate shall redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity equal in value to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC. The purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not include the amount of any unearned advanced storage payments received with respect to the redeemed loan collateral. Upon submission of the certificate, which is endorsed to CCC, to the county FSA office which issued the loan, the holder of a commodity certificate will receive the quantity of the commodity which has been sold to CCC. Except as otherwise determined by CCC, if the holder of such certificate does not have commodities pledged as collateral for CCC loans equal in value to the dollar denomination of the certificate, as determined by CCC, CCC will, at CCC's option and after the producer has submitted the certificate, pay the difference to the person by check or in the form of a new commodity certificate.

      (2)  No person may use a commodity certificate to receive a quantity of tobacco, peanuts, or extra long staple cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan. No person may, before August 1, 1986, use a commodity certificate to receive a quantity of upland cotton pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.

      (f)  (1) The person to whom a generic certificate is issued which has a date entered in block D may submit such certificate, endorsed to CCC, at the issuing county FSA office for payment by check in the amount of the certificate on or after the date entered in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such person may not exchange the certificate for commodities owned by CCC, except as otherwise agreed upon between such person and CCC.

      (2) The person to whom a generic certificate is issued which has an entry of “S/H” in block D may exchange such certificate for commodities owned by CCC.

      (3) The person to whom a commodity specific certificate is issued which has a date entered in block D may submit such certificate, endorsed to CCC, to the Kansas City Commodity Office for the specific commodity entered in block C beginning on the date entered in block D through the expiration date of the certificate. Such certificate may not be exchanged for cash, except as otherwise agreed on by CCC.

      (4) All other certificates may be transferred and exchanged as determined and announced by CCC.

      (g) —(1)  If a commodity certificate indicates that it is a “generic” certificate, such certificate may, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, be exchanged for any commodity made available by CCC or, as appropriate, used to receive a quantity of any commodity which serves as collateral for a CCC loan. If a certificate is not a “generic certificate”, such certificate may be exchanged for the commodity specified on the certificate, except as may be determined and announced by CCC.

      (2)  Certificates issued as payments under the 1991 through 1995 upland cotton program, including payments issued in accordance with section 103B(a)(5)(B) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, may be exchanged for CCC-owned upland cotton only during such times as determined and announced by CCC.

      (3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a person submits a commodity specific certificate to CCC in exchange for a quantity of such commodity and CCC determines it is not possible to make such commodity available, CCC may: (i) Require such person to exchange the commodity specific certificate for a generic certificate; or (ii) refuse to accept submission of such certificate until CCC is able to make available a quantity of the commodity specified on such certificate.

      (h) CCC, at its option, may discount or refuse to accept any certificate made, transferred, or submitted in violation of this section.

      (i)  With respect to producers who receive commodity certificates in accordance with the wheat, feed grains, upland cotton and rice price support and production adjustment programs authorized by parts 1413 and 1421 of this title, a producer to whom the certificate is issued who exchanges such a certificate with CCC for cash in accordance with subsection (f) of this section shall receive interest with respect to such certificate for a 150 day period. Such interest shall be the rate of interest determined in accordance with part 1405 of this Title which is in effect on the date the certificate is issued.

      § 1401.5   In kind payments.

#### § § 1401.5

      (a) Subject to the provisions of §§ 1470.2 and 1470.3, CCC may make payments in the form of commodities. Quantities of commodities made available as payment shall be based upon the value of the commodity, as determined by CCC. Such quantity may be adjusted by CCC to reflect the location, quality, and other similar factors which CCC determines to affect the value of the commodity.

      (b) The transfer of title to commodities made available in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be in store, except as determined by CCC, and shall be made without regard to any State law or any claim of lien against the commodity, or proceeds thereof, which may be asserted by any creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government whose lien arises specifically under Federal statute. The recipient of such commodities shall be responsible for all costs incurred in transferring title to the commodity, except as specifically provided by CCC.

      (1) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance in all counties for each crop of economic significance in which the producer has an interest;

      (2) Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance for some, but not all, crops of economic significance for which the producer has an interest, and sign a waiver; or

      (3) Sign a waiver that waives any eligibility for crop loss assistance in connection with the producer's crop.

      (b)  The term “crop of economic significance” means a crop that has contributed in the previous year, or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, 10 percent or more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the total expected liability under the catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to or less than the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop will not be considered a crop of economic significance.

      (2) CCC will deduct from the proceeds of a marketing assistance loan an amount equal to the amount of an assessment otherwise authorized to be remitted to a federally authorized entity under a Federal statute by the producer of the commodity pledged as collateral for such loan or the first purchaser of such commodity in the manner agreed to by CCC and the entity to whom the Secretary of Agriculture has authorized to collect such assessments.

      (b) CCC will collect commodity assessments authorized under a State statute when:

      (1) The State entity has:

      (i) Requested that the assessment be collected;

      (ii) Identified whether the assessment is to be collected at the time the loan proceeds are disbursed or at the time the commodity is forfeited to CCC;

      (iii) Identified the person who may enter into an agreement with CCC that sets forth the obligations of the State and CCC with respect to the collection of the assessment; and

      (iv) Provided an opinion from the Office of the Attorney General to CCC that concludes the person signing the agreement may obligate the State to comply with the agreement and the provisions of Public Law 108-470 have been met.

      (2) The agreement described in paragraph (c) of this section has been executed by the appropriate State official and CCC.

      (c) CCC will enter into an agreement with an authorized State official to collect commodity assessments when the actions set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section have been completed.

      (1) The State will indemnify CCC for any costs incurred in the collection of the assessment including costs incurred with respect to resolution of disputes arising from the requested collection of the assessment but not for administrative costs incurred by CCC in the collection of the assessment;

      (2) The State, in cases where an assessment has been collected two or more times with respect to the same quantity of the commodity subject to the assessment, will refund the amount of the excess collection to the producer.

      (3) The agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days notice.

      (4) The State, in cases where the marketing assistance loan is made by a cooperative marketing association or a designated marketing association approved by CCC, or any other similar entity that is approved by CCC, to obtain such a loan on behalf of its members may enter into individual arrangements with such entity to facilitate the collection of the assessment with the approval of CCC.

        § 1409.7   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1409.7

        (a) If an MFP payment resulted from erroneous information provided by a producer, or any person acting on their behalf, the payment will be recalculated and the producer must refund any excess payment to CCC with interest calculated from the date of the disbursement of the payment.

        (b) The refund of any payment to CCC is in addition to liability under any other provision of law including, but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001, and 1014; 15 U.S.C. 714; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.

        (c) The regulations in parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to determinations under this part.

        (d) Any payment under this part will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the commodity or proceeds from the sale of the commodity.

        (e) The $900,000 average AGI limitation provisions in part 1400 of this chapter relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, apply to each applicant for MFP. The average AGI will be calculated for a person or legal entity based on the 3 complete tax years that precede the year for which the payment is made (for the 2018 crop year or marketing year for livestock and dairy the tax years are 2014, 2015, and 2016).

        (g) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this chapter apply to MFP. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. If anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a producer to directly receive an MFP payment, then the MFP payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest.

        (h) For the purposes of the effect of lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), CCC waives the restriction on receipt of funds under MFP but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of such waiver, agree to apply the MFP payments to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (i) The provisions of § 718.304 of this title, “Failure to Fully Comply,” do not apply to this part.

If anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a producer to directly receive an MFP payment, then the MFP payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest.

        (h) For the purposes of the effect of lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), CCC waives the restriction on receipt of funds under MFP but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of such waiver, agree to apply the MFP payments to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (i) The provisions of 7 CFR 718.304, “Failure to Fully Comply,” do not apply to this part.

      Subpart C—Expanded Domestic Commodity Donation Program (EDCDP)

        § 1409.201   Applicability.

#### § § 1409.201

        (a) This subpart specifies the process for eligible non-profit entities to receive commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) that CCC has acquired in response to trade actions taken by foreign governments resulting in the loss of exports. The types and quantities of commodities made available under this subpart, if any, is dependent upon the ability of CCC to use such commodities through existing domestic feeding programs administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). In the event that these domestic feeding programs are unable to use the commodities acquired by CCC, EDCDP is intended to provide the remaining commodities to low income individuals, primarily through eligible entities not participating in existing FNS food distribution programs.

        (b) CCC, as specified in the applicable Notice of Commodity Availability, will use grants and cooperative agreements to conduct the Expanded Domestic Commodity Donation Program (EDCDP).

        (c) The Food and Nutrition Service and the Agricultural Marketing Service will administer the EDCDP on behalf of CCC.

        § 1409.202   Definitions.

Cost-share payments are not subject to the provisions of § 1410.42(d).

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, cost-share payments will not be made to the same owner or operator on the same acreage for any eligible practices that have been previously established, or for which such owner or operator has received cost-share assistance from any other Federal agency.

      (c) Cost-share payments may be authorized for the replacement or restoration of practices for which cost-share payments have been previously allowed under CRP, only if:

      (1) Replacement or restoration of the practice is needed to achieve adequate erosion control, enhance water quality, wildlife habitat, or increase protection of public wellheads, or other conservation measures approved by CCC;

      (2) The failure of the original practice was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant; and

      (3) The benefits that would be received from the replacement or restoration of the practice outweighs the cost of replacing or restoring the practice.

      (d) Limitations on cost-share payments include:

      (1) The cost-share payment made to a participant will not exceed the participant's actual contribution to the eligible costs of establishing the practice.

      (2) The amount of the cost-share payments, including practice incentive payments, may not be an amount that, when added to such assistance from other sources, exceeds 100 percent of the actual cost of establishing the practice.

      (e) CCC will not make cost-share payments with respect to a CRP contract if any other Federal cost-share assistance has been, or is being, made with respect to the land subject to such CRP contract. Participants must refund to CCC all cost-share payments received under this part if other Federal cost-share assistance is received with respect to the same land.

      (f) CCC may make cost-share payments for thinning of existing tree stands to benefit wildlife habitat and other resource conditions on enrolled land.

      (g) In addition to cost-share payments, a practice incentive payment will be made available to a participant to whom CCC has made a cost-share payment after a determination that an eligible practice has been installed in compliance with the appropriate standards and specifications. The practice incentive payment will be considered a cost-share payment for purposes of this part, and is not subject to the provisions of § 1410.42(d). A practice incentive payment will be provided only for land enrolled under:

      (1) Continuous sign-up as provided in § 1410.30(b); or

      (a) CCC will not pay more than 50 percent of either the actual or average cost of installing eligible practices specified in the conservation plan.

      (b) The average cost of performing a practice may be based on recommendations from the State Technical Committee. Such cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State or county.

      (c) If there is any other sources of cost-share assistance:

      (1) A participant may, in addition to any payment under this part, receive cost-share assistance, rental or easement payments, tax benefits, or other payments from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in CRP.

      (2) A participant may not receive or retain CRP cost-share payments if other Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such acreage under any law.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, cost-share payments for eligible seed related to the establishment of approved cover will not exceed 50 percent of the actual cost of the eligible seed mixture.

      (e) Practice incentive payments will not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the actual cost of installing the eligible practice specified in the conservation plan.

      § 1410.42   Annual rental payments.

#### § § 1410.42

      (a) Subject to the availability of funds, annual rental payments will be made in such amount and in accordance with such time schedule as specified in the CRP contract.

      (b) Annual rental payments are based on a weighted average soil rental rate, marginal pastureland rental rate, or grassland rate, as appropriate, and may include an incentive payment as a portion of the annual payment for specified practices. A per-acre national maximum rental payment rate may also be established by CCC for certain categories of CRP offers and contracts.

      (c) The annual rental payment will be divided among the participants on a CRP contract as agreed to in such CRP contract.

      (d) Limitations on annual rental payments include:

      (1) The maximum amount of annual rental payments that a person or entity may receive, directly or indirectly, under CRP for any fiscal year must not exceed $50,000. The regulations in part 1400 of this chapter will be used to determine if the limit has been reached or exceeded.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, annual rental payments received by a rural water district or association for land enrolled in CRP for the purpose of protecting a wellhead may exceed $50,000.

      (e) In the case of a contract succession, annual rental payments will be divided between the predecessor and the successor participants as agreed to among the participants and approved by CCC. If there is no agreement among the participants, annual rental payments will be divided in such manner deemed appropriate by CCC, and such distribution may be prorated based on the actual days of ownership of the property by each party.

      (f) CCC will prepare a schedule for each county that shows the maximum soil rental rate CCC may pay and which may be supplemented to reflect special contract requirements. Such schedule may be calculated for cropland based on the relative productivity of soils within the county using NRCS data and local FSA average cash rental estimates. For marginal pastureland, rental rates will be based on estimates of the prevailing rental values of marginal pastureland in riparian areas. Grassland rental rates will be based on not more than 75 percent of the estimated grazing value of the land. The schedule will be available in the local FSA office and will indicate, when appropriate, that:

      (1) Offers by producers who request rental payments greater than the maximum payment rate for their offer will be rejected;

      (2) Offers submitted under continuous signup authorized at § 1410.30(b) may be accepted without further evaluation when the requested payment rate is less than or equal to the maximum payment rate for the offer; and

      (3) Otherwise qualifying offers will be ranked competitively based on factors established under § 1410.31 in order to provide the most cost-effective environmental benefits.

      (g) In the case of an owner or operator who transfers acreage to a wetland reserve easement in accordance with § 1410.10, annual rental payments will be prorated based on the actual number of days the transferred acreage was enrolled in CRP.

      § 1410.44   Average adjusted gross income.

#### § § 1410.44

      (a) Benefits under this part will not be available to persons or entities whose average adjusted gross income exceeds $900,000 for the 3 taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, or who otherwise do not meet the AGI requirements specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

      (b) The limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived in accordance with part 1400, subpart F, of this chapter.

      § 1410.45   Incentive payments.

#### § § 1410.45

      (a) A signup incentive payment will be made to eligible participants only for the initial enrollment of certain land that is enrolled under:

      (1) A continuous signup authorized in § 1410.30(b) for land to be devoted to particular uses as determined by CCC; and

      (2) A Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program as specified in § 1410.90 for land to be devoted to particular uses as determined by CCC.

      (b) The signup incentive payment will be:

      (1) An amount equal to 32.5 percent of the amount of the first annual rental payment for the land referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, as determined by CCC;

      (2) Divided among the participants on a CRP contract in accordance with their share of the annual rental payment as agreed to in such CRP contract;

      (3) Considered an annual rental payment and thus subject to the provisions in § 1410.42(d); and

      (4) Made only after the CRP contract is approved by CCC.

      (c) A signup incentive payment will not be made for land that was previously enrolled in CRP or land currently enrolled in CRP that is re-enrolled.

      (d) CCC may make incentive payments to owners and operators of enrolled land in an amount sufficient to encourage proper tree thinning and other practices to improve the condition of resources, promote forest management, or enhance wildlife habitat. Incentive payments for such tree thinning and other practices will:

      (1) Not exceed 100 percent of the total cost of the practice;

      (2) Only be available for practices outlined in the tree planting plan under the approved CRP conservation plan;

      (3) Only be made to the extent that funds are available; and

      (4) Not exceed $200,000 per person or entity.

      (e) Additional financial incentives may be provided to participants whose contracts are expected to provide especially high environmental benefits. Such incentives will be considered annual rental payments and subject to the provisions in § 1410.42(d).

      § 1410.51   Transfer of land.

#### § § 1410.51

      (a) If a new owner or operator purchases or obtains the right and interest in, or right to occupancy of, the land subject to a CRP contract, such new owner or operator may be approved by CCC as a participant to a new CRP contract for the transferred land. Such new owner or operator must assume all obligations of the CRP contract of the previous participant.

      (b) Cost-share payments will be made by CCC to the participant who established the practice.

      (c) Annual rental payments to be paid during the fiscal year when the land was transferred will be divided between the new participant and the previous participant in the manner specified in § 1410.42.

      (d) If a participant transfers all or part of the right and interest in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a CRP contract and the new owner or operator does not become a successor to such CRP contract within 60 days, or such other time period as CCC determines to be appropriate, then such CRP contract will be terminated with respect to the affected portion of such land and the original participant:

      (1) Forfeits all rights to any future payments for that acreage; and

      (2) Will refund all previous payments received under the CRP contract by the participant(s) or prior participants, plus interest and liquidated damages, except as otherwise agreed to by CCC.

      (e) Federal agencies acquiring property, by foreclosure or otherwise, that contains CRP contract acreage cannot be a party to the CRP contract by succession. However, through an addendum to the CRP contract, if the current operator of the property is one of the CRP contract participants, such operator may continue to receive payments under such CRP contract if:

      (1) The property is maintained in accordance with the terms of the CRP contract;

      (2) Such operator continues to be the operator of the property; and

      (3) Ownership of the property remains with such Federal agency.

#### § § 1410.55

      (a) Any representative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or designee thereof, will, for purposes related to CRP, be provided by the producer or participant, as the case may be, with access to land that is:

      (1) The subject of an offer for a contract under this part; or

      (2) Under a CRP contract or otherwise subject to this part.

      (b) For land identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the producer or participant will provide the representative with access to examine records for the land to determine land classification, erosion rates, or for other purposes, and to determine whether the terms and conditions of the CRP contract are being met.

      § 1410.56   Division of payments and provisions about tenants and sharecroppers.

#### § § 1410.56

      (a) Payments received under this part will be divided as specified in the applicable CRP contract and CCC will ensure that producers who would have an interest in acreage being offered receive treatment that is equitable. CCC may refuse to enter into a contract when there is a disagreement among producers seeking enrollment as to a producer's eligibility to participate in the CRP contract as a tenant and there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether the producer seeking participation as a tenant does or does not have an interest in the acreage offered for enrollment in CRP.

      (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from a CRP contract when:

      (1) The operator or tenant requests in writing to be removed from the CRP contract;

      (2) The operator or tenant files for bankruptcy and the trustee or debtor in possession fails to affirm the contract, to the extent permitted by applicable bankruptcy laws;

      (3) The operator or tenant dies during the CRP contract period and the administrator of the estate fails to succeed to the contract; or

      (c) In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, tenants must maintain their tenancy throughout the CRP contract period in order to remain on a CRP contract. Tenants who fail to maintain tenancy on the acreage under CRP contract, including failure to comply with applicable State law, may be removed from a CRP contract by CCC. CCC will assume the tenancy is being maintained unless notified otherwise by a party to the CRP contract.

      § 1410.57   Payments not subject to claims.

#### § § 1410.57

      Subject to part 3 of this title, any payment or portion thereof due any person under this part will be allowed without regard to questions of title under State law, and without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.

      § 1410.58   Assignments.

      § 1410.60   Scheme or device.

#### § § 1410.60

      (a) If CCC determines that a person has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, or any part of any CCC or USDA program, payment otherwise due or paid such person during the applicable period may be required to be refunded with interest as determined by CCC.

      (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of cost-share, incentive, or annual rental payments, or obtaining a payment that otherwise would not be payable.

      (c) A new owner or operator or tenant of land subject to a CRP contract, and who succeeds to the CRP contract, must report in writing to CCC any interest of any kind in such land that is retained by a previous participant. The interest will include a present, future, or conditional interest, reversionary interest, or any option, future or present, on such land, and any interest of any lender in the land where the lender has, will, or can legally obtain, a right of occupancy to such land or an interest in the equity in the land other than an interest in the appreciation in the value of the land occurring after the loan was made. Failure to fully disclose interest will be considered a scheme or device.

      § 1410.61   Filing of false claims.

#### § § 1410.61

      If CCC determines that any participant has knowingly supplied false information or has knowingly filed a false claim, such participant will be ineligible for payments under this part with respect to the fiscal year in which the false information or claim was filed and the CRP contract may be terminated, in which case a full refund of all prior payments may be demanded. False information or false claims include, but are not limited to, claims for payment for practices that do not comply with the conservation plan. Any amounts paid under these circumstances must be refunded, plus interest as determined by CCC and any amounts otherwise due to the participant will be withheld. The remedies provided for in this section will be in addition to any and all other remedies, criminal and civil, that may apply.

      § 1410.62   Miscellaneous.

#### § § 1410.62

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, in the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, any payments due under this part will be paid to the participant's successor(s), as specified in part 707 of this title.

      (c) Any remedies permitted CCC under this part will be in addition to any other remedy, including, but not limited to, criminal remedies, or actions for damages in favor of CCC, or the United States, as may be permitted by law.

      (d) When an owner loses control of CRP acreage due to foreclosure and the new owner chooses not to continue the contract in accordance with § 1410.51, refunds may not be required from any participant on the contract to the extent CCC determines that waiver of such refund is appropriate.

      (e) Cropland enrolled in CRP will be classified as cropland for the time period it is enrolled in CRP. After the CRP contract ends, such land will be removed from the classification of cropland if the county committee determines the land no longer meet the definition of cropland in part 718 of this title.

      (f) As determined by CCC, incentives may be authorized to foster opportunities for Indian Tribes and beginning, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers and ranchers, and to enhance long-term environmental goals.

      (2) Not less than 30 percent of the total cost of the project, if a majority of the matching funds to carry out the agreement are provided by one or more nongovernmental organizations.

      (d) Notwithstanding § 1410.40(d), cost-share payments, including practice incentive payments, from all sources may exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of establishing eligible practices, but only if specifically authorized by the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program agreement. Furthermore, a participant may not receive or retain cost-share payments if other Federal cost-share assistance is provided for such acreage under any law.

      (e) With regard only to land enrolled as a riparian buffer:

      (1) The term “management” means an activity conducted by the owner or operator of the land after the riparian buffer is established to regularly maintain or enhance only the vegetative cover throughout the CRP contract period and in accordance with the conservation plan;

      (2) Cost-share payments will be made available for approved management as provided for in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program agreement:

      (i) If such activity has been completed in accordance with the conservation plan; and

      (ii) In an amount as provided for in the agreement, but not greater than 100 percent of the normal and customary cost of such activity; but

      (iii) No practice incentive payment will be made for such activity; and

      (3) If provided for in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program agreement, a participant may plant food-producing woody plants as part of the approved cover, provided such plantings:

      (i) Contribute to the conservation of soil, water quality, and wildlife habitat;

      (ii) Are consistent with recommendations of the applicable State Technical Committee;

      (iii) Are consistent with the FOTG; and

      (iv) Are provided for in the conservation plan.

    PART 1412—AGRICULTURE RISK COVERAGE, PRICE LOSS COVERAGE, AND COTTON TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

### Part 1412

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1508b, 7911-7912, 7916, 8702, 8711-8712, 8751-8752, and 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c.

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 46339, Aug. 8, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1412.1   Applicability, changes in law, interest, application, and contract provisions.

#### § § 1412.1

        (a) This part specifies how base acres and farm program payment yields are established or adjusted for the purpose of calculating payments for agriculture risk coverage (ARC) and price loss coverage (PLC) for covered commodities: Wheat, oats, and barley (including wheat, oats, and barley used for haying and grazing); corn; grain sorghum; long grain rice; medium grain rice; seed cotton; pulse crops; soybeans; other oilseeds; and peanuts. This part specifies how and when producers on a farm may make an election and enroll on a farm to obtain either ARC or PLC (and if ARC, whether to receive ARC payments based on county coverage applicable on a covered commodity-by-commodity basis; or individual coverage applicable to all the covered commodities on a farm).

        (b) Payments otherwise provided for in this part are subject to changes made by law in rates, conditions, and eligibility notwithstanding any contract under this part. However, any such modification may, as determined by FSA, allow producers the opportunity to withdraw their ARC or PLC contract.

        (c) If any refund is due to FSA under this part, interest will be due from the date of the FSA disbursement except as determined by FSA. The provisions of this section will apply notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other part. In order to receive payment under this part a participant is required to comply with the regulations in this part and any additional requirements imposed by the ARC or PLC contract.

        (d) For ARC and PLC, assistance under this part will be provided for producers satisfying all requirements of this part who have a share of eligible base acres of the covered commodity. The sum of the base acres on a farm are based on the farm's constitution according to part 718 of this title. FSA farm records and PLC yields are based on the administrative county of the farm. ARC-CO assistance under this part will be determined by FSA for the enrolled covered commodity base acres based on the physical location of covered commodity base acres on a farm weighted and summarized to the farm.

> [79 FR 46339, Aug. 8, 2014, as amended at 83 FR 40656, Aug. 16, 2018; 84 FR 45887, Sept. 3, 2019]

        § 1412.2   Administration.

#### § § 1412.2

        (a) ARC and PLC are administered under the general supervision of the Executive Vice-President, CCC, and will be carried out by FSA State and county committees (State and county committees).

        (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this part.

        (c) The State committee may take any action required by the regulations of this part that the county committee has not taken. The State committee will also:

        (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part; or

        (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

        (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee will preclude the Executive Vice President, or the Deputy Administrator, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

        (e) The Deputy Administrator has the authority to permit State and county committees to waive or modify any non-statutory deadline specified in this part.

        (f) Items of general applicability to program participants, including, but not limited to, application periods, application deadlines, internal operating guidelines issued to State and county offices, prices, yields, and payment factors established for ARC or PLC, are not subject to appeal in accordance with part 780 of this title.

> [79 FR 46339, Aug. 8, 2014, as amended at 83 FR 40656, Aug. 16, 2018]

        § 1412.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1412.3

        The definitions in this section are applicable for all purposes of administering this part. The terms defined in part 718 of this title and part 1400 of this chapter are also applicable, except where those definitions conflict with the definitions specified in this section. Where there is a conflict or a difference in definitions specified in this part and part 718 of this title or part 1400 of this chapter, the regulations in this part will apply.

        means the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-79), as amended.

        means the yield, which is calculated as the crop year production of a covered commodity in the county divided by the commodity's total planted acres for a crop year in the county.

        (1) For wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley and oats, planted acres are the harvested acres plus unharvested acres.

        (2) In determining the yield for a county, FSA uses data in order from the following data sources: RMA and yields determined by State committee.

        (3) Separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields will be established in a county having farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2013 through 2017. These separate yields will be established where FSA determines the covered commodity's P&CP acreage was both irrigated and non-irrigated in 2013 through 2017.

        (4) At FSA's discretion, FSA will calculate and use a trend-adjusted yield factor to adjust the yield taking into consideration, but not exceeding, the trend-adjusted yield factor that is used to increase yield history under the crop insurance endorsement under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524).

        is calculated as follows for:

        (1) ARC-CO, for a crop year of a covered commodity: The actual average county yield per planted acre of the covered commodity times the higher of either the market year average (MYA) price of the covered commodity or the national average loan rate for the covered commodity. If a county has separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields established for a covered commodity, the actual crop revenue calculated for a farm with that covered commodity will be weighted by FSA based on the farm's historical irrigated percentage.

        (2) ARC-IC, for a producer on a farm for a crop year, which is based on the producer's enrolled share of planted acres of all covered commodities on all farms for which ARC-IC has been elected and in which the producer has an interest for which the producer enrolled: the sum of the results of the following calculation for each covered commodity on the farm:

        (i) The total production of the covered commodity for all enrolled farms in the State in which the producer has an interest; times

        (ii) The higher of either the MYA price or national loan rate for the covered commodity; divided by

        (iii) The producer's share of the planted acres of the covered commodity in the State.

        means, for the purposes of ARC-CO, the division of specific counties into two areas for counties that are each larger than 1,400 square miles and have more than 190,000 base acres where appropriate based on the differences in weather patterns, soil types, and other factors.

        means coverage provided under subparts D and E of this part.

        means the Agriculture Risk Coverage elected with the county option.

        is calculated for a crop year for a covered commodity, and is equal to 86 percent of the benchmark revenue for ARC-CO and ARC-IC, as defined in this part.

        means the Agriculture Risk Coverage elected with the individual option.

        is calculated as the sum of the producer's interests in all of the producer's farms having an ARC-IC election and enrollment in the State.

        means the 5-year Olympic determined by FSA as the average of actual average county yields for the most recent 5 years for which data is available, substituting 80 percent of the county transitional yield as defined in this part in each year in which the actual average county yield is less than 80 percent of the county transitional yield. Separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields will be established in a county having a sufficient number of farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2013 through 2017. These separate yields will be established for counties where a covered commodity's P&CP acreage was both irrigated and non-irrigated in 2013 through 2017. If needed, a trend-adjusted yield factor will be used to adjust the yield taking into consideration, but not exceeding, the trend-adjusted yield factor that is used to increase yield history under the crop insurance endorsement under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1520).

        means, with respect to a covered commodity on a farm, the number of acres in effect on September 30, 2013, as defined in the regulations in 7 CFR part 1412, subpart B that were in effect on that date, subject to any reallocation, adjustment, or reduction. The term “base acres” includes any unassigned base acres.

        is calculated as the product obtained by multiplying the average historical county yield times the average MYA price for the most recent 5 crop years available, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest prices and substituting the effective reference price in each year where the MYA price is less than the effective reference price. If a county has separate irrigated and non-irrigated yields established for a covered commodity, the benchmark revenue calculated by FSA for that farm and covered commodity will be weighted based on the farm's historical irrigated percentage.

        means a producer's share of all covered commodities planted on all farms in the State for which individual ARC has been elected and enrolled and in which the producer has an interest. FSA will calculate the benchmark revenue for ARC-IC using the following three steps, based on the producer's planted commodities:

        (1) For each planted covered commodity for each of the most recent 5 crop years available:

        (i) Yield per planted acre (substituting 80 percent of the county transitional yield in each year where the yield per planted acre is less than 80 percent of the county transitional yield); times

        (ii) The MYA price for the most recent 5 crop years, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest prices and substituting the effective reference price in each year where the MYA price is less than the effective reference price.

        (2) For each covered commodity, the average of the revenues determined under paragraph (1) of this definition for the most recent 5 crop years available, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest revenues; and

        (3) For each of the 2019 through 2023 crop years, the benchmark revenue for the ARC-IC farm is the sum of the amounts determined under paragraph (2) of this definition for all covered commodities on such farms, adjusted to reflect the ratio between the total number of P&CP acres and eligible subsequently planted crop acreage on such farms to a covered commodity and the total P&CP acres and eligible subsequently planted crop acreage of all covered commodities planted on such farms. If a producer has an interest in multiple farms that have enrolled in ARC-IC, the ARC-IC benchmark revenue for that producer will be a weighted average of the benchmark revenue for those multiple farms.

        means acreage approved as prevented planted in accordance with part 718 of this title.

        means the CCC-approved forms and appendixes that constitute the agreement for participation of producers and covered commodities in ARC or PLC Program, as applicable.

        means the compliance period specified for the contract for the particular program year, as designated on the contract or application. References to the “contract” period refer to the compliance period for the particular program year. The compliance period for each program year is October 1 through September 30. For example, for the 2019 contract (and therefore for the 2019 program), the period that begins on October 1, 2018 and ends on September 30, 2019.

        means the particular year of the particular contract based on the compliance period for the contract or application. The compliance year will run from October 1 to the following September 30 and will have the same name as the corresponding fiscal year. For example, the 2019 contract or program year will be October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, and that year will also be considered the 2019 crop year. The same references will apply to all other years.

        means the farm's covered commodity yield as specified in the regulations for 7 CFR part 1412 that were in effect as of September 30, 2013.

        means agriculture risk coverage (ARC-CO) elected under subpart D of this part with the county option.

        means wheat, oats, and barley (including wheat, oats, and barley used for haying and grazing), corn, grain sorghum, long grain rice, medium grain rice, seed cotton, pulse crops, soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts.

        means base acres of any covered commodity. The term does not include unassigned base acres on the farm.

        means the relevant contract or application year. For example, the 2019 crop year is the year that runs from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, and references to payments for that year refer to payments made under contracts or applications with the compliance year that runs during those dates.

        means the _Deputy Administrator_ for Farm Programs, FSA, or a designee.

        means:

        (1) Land has been approved by the local government for uses other than commercial agricultural uses; and

        (2) Construction activity has begun to install any aspect of the development, for example utilities or roadways.

        means the farm's upland cotton yield established as specified in the regulations for 7 CFR part 1412 that were in effect as of September 30, 2013.

        means for covered commodities, notwithstanding the meaning in subparts D and E of this part for fruits and vegetables, the planting of a covered commodity for harvest in a crop year, in cycle with another covered commodity on the same acres for harvest in the same crop year in counties that have been determined to be areas where there is determined to be substantial, successful, and long-term double cropping of the crop and where the producer has followed customary production techniques and planting deadlines as determined by FSA (that is, using techniques and deadlines used by the majority of farmers in the region to double crop the particular crops involved). In a county determined capable of supporting such double-cropping of the covered commodities, as determined by FSA, both an initial crop and a subsequent crop will be considered planted or prevented planted acres for the purpose of this part. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of 7 CFR part 718, in those instances where the subsequently planted or approved prevented planted covered commodity cannot be recognized as double-cropped acreage under this definition, the subsequently planted crop acreage will not be considered planted or prevented planted.

        means Austrian, wrinkled seed, yellow, Umatilla, and green peas, excluding peas grown for the fresh, canning, or frozen market.

        is, the higher of the—

        (1) National average market price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the covered commodity (also known as the MYA price), as determined by FSA; or

        (2) National average loan rate as defined in this part for the covered commodity in effect for the crop year, which is the same as the loan rate for a marketing assistance loan for the commodity for that crop year.

        means the lesser of the following:

        (1) An amount equal to 115 percent of the reference price for a covered commodity; or

        (2) An amount equal to the greater of:

        (i) The reference price for a covered commodity; or

        (ii) 85 percent of the average of the MYA price of the covered commodity for the most recent 5 crop years available, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest MYA price.

        means cotton that is other than upland cotton and both the following:

        (1) Produced from pure strain varieties of the Barbadense species or any hybrid of the species, or other similar types of extra long staple cotton, designated by the Secretary, having characteristics needed for various end uses for which United States upland cotton is not suitable and grown in irrigated cotton-growing regions of the United States designated by the Secretary or other areas designated by the Secretary as suitable for the production of the varieties or types; and

        (2) Ginned on a roller-type gin or, if authorized by the Secretary, ginned on another type of gin for experimental purposes.

        means any cropland or DCP cropland that is not devoted to any crop or trees.

        means the constitution of the farm. References to “farm structure” can be by date or crop year. When references to farm structure are by crop year, that means the farm as was last constituted as specified in 7 CFR part 718 subpart C in that crop year.

        means the year running from October 1 to the following September 30 and will be designated by the same calendar year in which it ends. For example, the 2019 fiscal year begins on October 1, 2018 and ends on September 30, 2019.

        means the number of base acres for upland cotton in effect on September 30, 2013, as defined in the regulations in 7 CFR part 1412, subpart B that were in effect on that date, subject to any adjustment or reduction under this part. _Generic base acres_ are subject to allocation according to § 1412.25.

        means any cropland or DCP cropland devoted to grass, native grass, mixed forage two or more interseeded grass mix, and mixed forage native grass interseeded.

        means the producer has removed the crop from the field by hand, mechanically, or by grazing of livestock. The crop is considered harvested once it is removed from the field and placed in or on a truck or other conveyance or is consumed by livestock through the act of grazing. Crops normally placed in a truck or other conveyance and taken off the crop acreage, such as hay, are considered harvested when in the bale, whether removed from the field or not.

        means the percentage of the covered commodity on a farm that was irrigated (P&CP, including subsequently planted crop acreage) divided by the total acreage of the covered commodity (P&CP, including subsequently planted crop acreage) between the years 2013 through 2017, or, at FSA's discretion, such other similar 5 year-period (such as 2015 through 2019).

        means any cropland or DCP cropland that is not devoted to any crop or trees.

        means ARC (ARC-IC) elected under subpart D of this part with the individual option.

        means medium grain rice and includes short grain rice and temperate japonica rice.

        means the 5 years preceding the most immediately preceding crop year. For example, for the 2019 crop year, the most recent 5 years available are 2013 through 2017.

        means the National Agricultural Statistics Service.

        means the loan rate established for a crop year of the covered commodity as specified in 7 CFR part 1421.

        A participant may seek reconsideration and review of any individual program eligibility adverse determination made under this part in accordance with the appeal regulations found at parts 11 and 780 of this title.

      Subpart B—Establishment of Base Acres for a Farm for Covered Commodities

        § 1412.23   Base acres, and Conservation Reserve Program.

#### § § 1412.23

        (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, FSA will annually adjust the base acres for covered commodities with respect to the farm by the number of production flexibility contract acres or base acres protected by a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contract that expired, was voluntarily terminated, or was early released.

        (b) The total base acres on a farm cannot exceed the limitation specified in § 1412.24.

        (c) Adjustments to (not reallocation of) base acres on a farm in accordance with this section are to be completed by no later than August 1 or other date as determined and announced by the CRP contract expired or was voluntarily terminated.

        (d) For the fiscal year in which an adjustment to base acres under this section is made, the producer of the farm may elect to receive ARC or PLC payments, in accordance with any ARC and PLC election made under section 1115 of the 2014 Farm Bill with respect to the base acres added to the farm under this section, or a prorated payment under the CRP contract, but not both. For any farm that had all of its base acres reduced for participation in CRP, if the farm had no base acres or election in effect before an adjustment is made to put base acres of a covered commodity back on the farm, the owners of that farm will have an opportunity to reallocate base acres and the producers will have an opportunity to elect ARC or PLC within 30 days of being notified of the establishment of base acres on that farm before producers enroll base acres on that farm.

        § 1412.24   Limitation of total base acres on a farm.

#### § § 1412.24

        (a) The sum of the following cannot exceed the total cropland acreage on the farm, plus approved double-cropped acreage for the farm:

        (1) The sum of all base acres established for the farm in accordance with this part; plus

        (2) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a CRP contract in accordance with part 1410 of this chapter; plus

        (3) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a wetland reserve program contract in accordance with part 1467 of this chapter; plus

        (4) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a Federal conservation program for which payments are made in exchange for not producing an agricultural commodity on the acreage.

        (b) The Deputy Administrator will give the owner of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres against which any reduction required in this section will be made. Absent the owner selecting the base acres for reduction, FSA will apply a pro-rata reduction against the base acres before computing and issuing any payments for the program year when a reduction becomes necessary.

        (c) In applying paragraph (a) of this section, FSA will take into account the practice of double cropping on a farm, as determined by FSA.

        (d) For base acre reductions:

        (1) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base acres   will be allowed when all owners of the farm execute and submit a written request for such reduction, on a CCC-approved standard, uniform form designated by CCC, to the FSA county office where the records for the farm are administratively maintained.

        (2) A permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base acres to negate or reduce a program violation is not allowed.

        (e) When base acres on a farm are converted to a non-agricultural commercial or industrial use, the total base acres on the farm will be reduced accordingly regardless of the submission of a request for such reduction.

        (f) The base acres on a farm will be proportionately reduced when it is determined that the land has been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses if, in the judgment of the county committee, the size of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless either of the following applies:

        (1) The producers on the farm demonstrate that the land remains devoted to commercial agricultural production or is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use and such land has not been divided from the farm with a farm reconstitution performed according to part 718 of this title; or

        (2) A properly constituted or reconstituted farm contains sufficient land that has not yet been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses, and the producers on the farm demonstrate that the land remains devoted to commercial agricultural production or is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use.

        § 1412.25   Allocation of generic base acres on a farm and updating of records.

#### § § 1412.25

        (a) Any or all of the owner(s) of a farm with generic base acres adjusted as of February 9, 2018, will have a one-time opportunity in an allocation period as announced by FSA, if a covered commodity including upland cotton was planted or prevented from being planted during the 2009 through 2016 crop years, to:

        (1) Allocate the farm's generic base acres to seed cotton base acres in a quantity equal to the greater of:

        (i) 80 percent of the generic base acres on the farm; or

        (ii) The average number of upland cotton acres planted and prevented from being planted on the farm during the 2009 through 2012 crop years, not to exceed the total generic base acres on the farm; or

        (2) Allocate base acres for covered commodities, including seed cotton, by applying paragraph (e) of this section.

        (b) Under no circumstances will the allocation of generic base acres on a farm as specified in paragraph (a) of this section result in any increase in total base acres on a farm. Additionally, if any owner submits a written statement that conflicts with the allocation request or expresses written disagreement with the allocation filed according to paragraph (a) of this section, no allocation will be approved for the farm unless all the owners of the farm provide FSA with written evidence of the dispute resolution during the allocation period.

        (c) FSA will provide the farm operator and owners of record with a summary of all covered commodities P&CP acres and subsequently planted crop acreage for the 2008 through 2012 crop years (as reported to FSA on acreage reports filed with FSA in each of those years). Acreage not reported to FSA by producers will not be included in the summary. The summary of records specified in paragraph (c) of this section is intended to assist owners of farms with the one-time opportunity for generic base acre allocation as provided in this section. Any owner of a farm may also at any time visit the FSA county office and request to obtain a copy of the summary referenced in this paragraph (c).

        (d) Owners will be provided a one-time opportunity to update the records identified in paragraph (c) of this section during the allocation period, provided that there are crop insurance records (or other verifiable documentation available to support those requested updates). In the event that an update to a farm's P&CP acres of a covered commodity for 2009 through 2012 causes any payment under another FSA or CCC program to become unearned, the overpayment must be refunded to FSA or CCC in accordance with the rules for that program and the FSA or CCC regulations governing overpayment (part 718 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter).

        (e) After an update as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner may allocate the farm's generic base acres during the allocation period based on a proration of each covered commodity's P&CP acres or subsequently planted crop acreage in crop years 2009 through 2012 to the total P&CP acres or subsequently planted crop acreage of all covered commodities during that time.

        (f) Owners can allocate generic base acres at any time during the allocation period without receiving or requesting the summary records, and, therefore, failure to receive a summary record from FSA is not grounds for appeal or extension of the allocation period.

        (g) The option to allocate generic base acres is an “all or nothing” decision for the farm. Generic base acres will not be retained, partially or in whole. A decision by any owner to allocate generic base acres on a farm in accordance with this section is final and binding if made according to this section during the allocation period unless that allocation is withdrawn in writing by that owner or another owner. If another owner subsequently files a different allocation request in whatever time remains in the stated allocation period or if there are conflicting allocation requests of owners in the allocation period, FSA will not make the allocation unless the conflict is resolved via written agreement between the owners who filed the conflicting requests. In the event that a resolution is not presented, the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section will take effect. In the case of submitting evidence of resolution, the written agreement must be filed with FSA during the allocation period. Any and all updates and allocation requests mentioned in this section are subject to review and approval or disapproval by FSA for CCC.

        (h) In the event that an owner fails to make an allocation according to this part and the farm has met the planting requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, the farm will receive an allocation of seed cotton base acres in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

        § 1412.26   Treatment of base acres on farms entirely in pasture, grass, idle, or fallow.

#### § § 1412.26

        (a) A farm on which all of the cropland was planted to grass or pasture, including cropland that was idle or fallow from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2017, will have base acres and yields maintained for the covered commodities on the farm, except that no payment will be made with respect to those base acres under this part for the 2019 through 2023 crop years.

        (b) The producers on a farm for which all of the base acres are maintained under paragraph (a) of this section are:

        (1) Ineligible to change the election applicable to the producers on the farm under subpart G of this part; and

        (2) Not permitted to reconstitute the farm to void or change the treatment of base acres under paragraph (a) of this section.

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 57716, Sept. 26, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1412.31   PLC yields for covered commodities.

#### § § 1412.31

        (a) Except for seed cotton PLC yield for covered commodities on the farm is equal to the counter-cyclical payment yield established for each covered commodity on the farm that was effective September 30, 2013, unless the PLC yield is updated as specified in § 1421.32. If the Secretary designates an additional oilseed or pulse crop as a covered commodity that does not have a counter-cyclical payment yield, the PLC yield for that commodity will be established as specified in § 1412.34.

        (b) The PLC yield for seed cotton on the farm is equal to the counter-cyclical payment yield established for upland cotton on the farm as in effect September 30, 2013, times 2.4, unless the PLC yield is updated as specified in § 1421.33.

        (c) If a PLC yield is not already established for a covered commodity on a farm for which base acres are allocated through the base acres reallocation process a yield will be established for the covered commodity on the farm using the yield on similarly situated farms, as determined by FSA. The yield on similarly situated farms will then be used as the 2013 county average counter-cyclical yield for the covered commodity.

        § 1412.32   Updating PLC yield for all covered commodities except seed cotton.

#### § § 1412.32

        (a) For any covered commodity on the farm that has base acres as adjusted, in excess of zero acres, an owner of the farm has a one-time opportunity in a specified period, as announced by FSA, to update PLC yields on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis equal to 90 percent of each covered commodity's 2013 through 2017 average yield per planted acre, excluding from the average any year when no acreage was planted to the covered commodity. If the yield per planted acre in any of the years 2013 through 2017 is less than 75 percent of the average of the county yield, then 75 percent of the average of the 2013 through 2017 county yield will be substituted for that year, excluding from the average any year when no acreage was planted to the covered commodity, multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing:

        (1) The average of the 2008 through 2012 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity; by

        (2) The average of the 2013 through 2017 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity.

        (b) The owner of the farm may retain the counter-cyclical yield as the PLC yield or update the PLC yield, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis.

        (c) PLC yields are exclusively used for PLC. However, any owner of a farm can update the PLC yields, regardless of program election or decision on enrollment or participation.

        (d) A decision by any owner of a farm to update any PLC yield as specified in this section is final and binding unless that decision to update the yield is withdrawn by that owner or a different yield update is made by that owner or another owner. If that owner or another owner requests a different PLC yield update for the covered commodity during the yield update period specified in paragraph (a) of this section that update will become final.

        (e) All PLC yield updates are subject to review and approval by FSA as specified in § 1412.36. FSA's decision to issue payments based on the PLC yield updated by an owner is subject to verification and spot check by FSA at any time.

        (f) Yield updates in this section will be permitted using the owner's certification of yield. The certification is subject to spot check or verification by FSA at any time. If selected for spot check or verification, the owner must submit evidence specified in § 1412.34 to support the certified yield.

        § 1412.33   Updating PLC yield for seed cotton.

#### § § 1412.33

        (a) For a farm that has seed cotton base acres as adjusted, in excess of zero acres, an owner of the farm has a one-time opportunity in a specified period, as announced by FSA, to update the PLC yield equal to 90 percent of the seed cotton's 2013 through 2017 average yield per planted acre, excluding from the average any year that no acreage was planted to upland cotton, times 2.4. If the yield per planted acre in any of the years 2013 through 2017 is less than 75 percent of the average of the county yield, then 75 percent of the average of the 2013 through 2017 county yields will be substituted for that year, excluding from the average any year when no acreage was planted to the covered commodity, multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing:

        (1) The average of the 2008 through 2012 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity; by

        (2) The average of the 2013 through 2017 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity.

        (b) The owner of the farm may retain the PLC yield or update the PLC yield.

        (c) PLC yields are exclusively used for PLC. However, any owner of a farm can update the seed cotton PLC yield as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, regardless of program election, enrollment, or participation.

        (d) A decision by any owner of a farm to update the seed cotton PLC yield as specified in this section is final and binding unless that decision to update the yield is withdrawn by that owner or a different yield update is made by that owner or another owner. If that owner or another owner requests a different PLC yield update for the covered commodity during the yield update period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, that update will become final.

        (e) All PLC yield updates are subject to review and approval by FSA as specified in § 1412.36. FSA's decision to issue payments based on the PLC yield updated by an owner is subject to verification and spot check by FSA at any time.

        (f) Yield updates in this section will be permitted using the owner's certification of yield. The certification is subject to spot check or verification by FSA at any time. If selected for spot check or verification, the owner must submit evidence specified in § 1412.35 to support the certified yield.

        § 1412.34   PLC yield for additional oilseeds.

#### § § 1412.34

        (a) The PLC yield for the farm for additional oilseeds designated by the Secretary will be determined by multiplying the weighted average yield per planted acre for the crop on the farm, as determined in paragraph (b) of this section, times the ratio resulting from:

        (1) The national average yield for the crop, as determined by FSA, divided by

        (2) The national average yield for the crop for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined by FSA.

        (b)(1) The yield per planted acre for such designated oilseed on the farm is calculated as follows:

        (i) The sum of the production of the crop for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; divided by

        (ii) The sum of the total planted acres of the crop for the 1998 through 2001 crop years.

        (2) The production of the crop for each of the 1998 through 2001 crop years will be the higher of the following, except in a year in which the acreage planted to the crop was zero, in which case the production for the crop for such year will be zero:

        (i) The total production for the applicable year based on the production evidence submitted in accordance with § 1412.35; or

        (ii) The amount equal to the product of:

        (A) The total planted acres for the crop, times

        (B) 75 percent of the harvested average county yield for that crop determined, where practicable, by calculating the weighted 4-year average of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) harvested acreage yields for the crop using the 1998 through 2001 crop years.

        (3) The NASS harvested acreage yield to be used in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be based on:

        (i) NASS harvested irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for producers who irrigated the crop in the applicable years;

        (ii) NASS harvested non-irrigated yield for the crop, if available, for producers who did not irrigate the crop in the applicable years; or

        (iii) NASS harvested blended yield for all acreage, regardless of whether or not the acres were irrigated or non-irrigated, for all crops in all counties for which the yields in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section are unavailable.

        (4) If NASS harvested acreage yield data is not available, the Deputy Administrator will assign a yield to be used in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

        (c) The establishment of PLC yield for an additional oilseed in this section will be permitted using a producer certification of yield. The certification is subject to spot check or verification by FSA at any time. If selected for spot check or verification, the producer must submit evidence as specified in in § 1412.35 to support the certified yield.

#### § § 1412.36

        (a) If a certification of production and yield or production evidence submitted in support of that certification is false or incorrect, as determined by the county committee, the county committee will determine whether the owner, operator, or producer submitting the certification or production evidence for a farm acted in good faith or took action to defeat the purpose of ARC or PLC.

        (b) If the county committee determines the owner or producer who submitted the certification or production evidence referenced in paragraph (a) of this section acted in good faith and did not take action to defeat the purpose of ARC or PLC, the county committee will, as applicable:

        (1) Correct the PLC yield for the applicable covered commodity to equal the yield that would have been calculated as specified in § 1412.32 based on accurate production evidence; and

        (2) Recalculate any payments based on the correct yield and require refunds of any payments that were issued as a result of the incorrect yield. Unearned payments must be refunded together with interest from the date of disbursement and are due from any producers who received payments that would not have issued absent the error or incorrect yield.

        (c) If the county committee determines the owner, operator, or producer who submitted the false or incorrect evidence did not act in good faith or took any action to defeat or undermine the purpose of ARC or PLC, the county committee will require a full refund of any payments, with interest, that were issued to any persons based on that false or erroneous certification or production evidence and the yield update request is invalid.

      Subpart D—ARC and PLC Contract Terms and Enrollment Provisions for Covered Commodities

        § 1412.41   ARC or PLC program contract.

#### § § 1412.41

        (a) The following provisions apply to ARC and PLC Program contracts:

        (1) Eligible producers (as specified in § 1412.42) of covered commodities with base acres may enroll in ARC and PLC contracts during the enrollment period announced by FSA.

        (i) The 2019 contract period ends September 30, 2019. Accordingly, the enrollment for 2019 is the only program year a retroactive contract can be approved. (ii) Except as stated in this section, enrollment is not allowed after September 30 of the fiscal year in which the ARC or PLC payments are requested. FSA will not process offers of enrollment for a contract period after the contract period has ended. This is not a compliance provision but a rule of general applicability and will apply to every offer to contract in each contract year.

        (iii) If a 2019 farm did not have a valid election made by producers in accordance with subpart G of this part, no producer on that farm is eligible for any 2019 ARC or PLC payment for that farm. This is not an adverse decision for any enrolled producer on that farm; rather, the farm's producers are simply not eligible for payments on the enrolled farm because the farm's producers failed to make a valid election in 2019.

        (2) Except as specified in this section for ARC-CO and PLC enrollments, contracts will not be approved unless all producers sharing in contract acreage with more than a zero share have submitted all applicable signatures on the contract and documentation necessary for FSA to approve the contract.

        (i) For ARC-IC contracts there are no exceptions to this provision for signatures and documentation.

        (ii) A contract not having all requisite signatures of producers having more than a zero share of contract acreage on or before the enrollment deadline is incomplete and will not be considered by FSA or CCC for any purpose and will not be acted on or approved.

        (iii) Contracts enrolled by a producer by the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that were not signed by other producers as required by this section will be withdrawn and will not be approved.

        (iv) An exception to this signature and documentation provision applies to ARC-CO and PLC offers of enrollment. In those instances in which, at the discretion of the Deputy Administrator and where no dispute of shares or other disagreement between producers is evident or suspected, ARC-CO and PLC offers of enrollment can be approved for the covered commodity to permit payment to only those eligible producers who did enroll and without regard to shares that do not have signatures. In this exception, the covered commodity on the farm will be considered enrolled. This exception will be made only if, in the sole judgment and discretion of FSA, FSA is satisfied that those producers who did sign in accordance with this section ensure compliance with all contract provisions and requirements of this part.

        (v) Producers have no right to payment on any farm that is not enrolled in ARC or PLC and they are not entitled to a decision to authorize the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) for ARC-CO and PLC enrollments, as that is discretionary. CCC and FSA are not responsible for ensuring that producers annually enroll in ARC or PLC.

        (3) An eligible producer's valid share of enrolled base acres on a farm is always limited to the producer's share of reported crop acreage on the farm. For example, if a producer enrolled with a 75 percent share of a farm's 1,000 base acres, the producer's enrollment would only be valid if the producer had 100 percent share interest in 750 or more reported crop acres on that farm. Valid claimed shares of base acres must always be supported by reported crop acres on the farm.

        (4) Except for enrollments of ARC-IC, eligible producers who choose to enter into a contract with FSA do so on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis. If the decision is made to enroll a covered commodity on a farm, producers having not less than 100 percent of the interest in those covered commodity base acres must enroll all covered commodity base acres of the covered commodity on the farm. Enrollment of fewer than all base acres of the covered commodity by all the producers having a share interest in that covered commodity on the farm is not allowed and such covered commodity will not be considered enrolled unless all producers who share in the base acres complete enrollment by the end of the enrollment period. Producers on a farm are solely responsible for ensuring that enrollment occurs.

        (5) Producers who have enrolled according to this section must submit all required documents necessary to determine payment eligibility as specified in §§ 1412.51 and 1412.67.

        (b) Any eligible producer of an enrolled covered commodity or ARC-IC contract may withdraw from a contract at any time by the end of the contract period. The withdrawal must be filed in writing and submitted to CCC and FSA by the end of the contract period. If any producer of a covered commodity or ARC-IC contract submits a written request to withdraw, FSA will consider the enrollment of that covered commodity or ARC-IC contract withdrawn.

        (c) If the multiyear annual contract option is selected by all of a farm's producers of covered commodity base acres on the farm, the enrollment of any covered commodity on the farm in a year will be presumed by CCC and FSA to be the enrollment for following subsequent crop years unless any of the following, occur:

        (1) A change to the farm's constitution;

        (2) A change to any of the farm's base acres or PLC yield of any covered commodity;

        (3) A change to any of the producers or producer shares of covered commodities on the farm;

        (4) A change in either election or enrollment of any covered commodity on the farm; or

        (5) Any change, including a withdrawal of any enrolled producer, that FSA determines to require producers on the farm to reaffirm enrollment.

        (d) All contracts expire on September 30 of the fiscal year of the contract unless:

        (1) Withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;

        (2) Terminated in accordance with paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or

        (3) Terminated at an earlier date by mutual consent of all parties, including CCC.

        (e) A transfer or change in the interest of an owner or producer in the farm or in acreage on the farm subject to a contract will result in the termination of the contract. The contract termination will be effective on the date of the transfer or change. Successors to the interest in the farm or crops on the farm subject to the contract may enroll the covered commodities on the farm in a new contract for the current year and assume all obligations under the contract.

        (f) In the event a 2019 or subsequent crop year farm reconstitution is completed on a properly enrolled farm or farms in accordance with part 718 of this title, FSA will issue notices to the farm operator and owners of record on a farm that all producers with an interest in the base acres on the farm must sign a new ARC or PLC program contract within the later of 30 days of the notice or September 30 of the fiscal year program payments are requested, after receiving written notification by the county committee indicating the reconstitution is completed. It is the responsibility of the operator and owners on a farm that producers with an interest in base acres are notified of the reconstitution and requirement for a new contract.

        § 1412.42   Eligible producers.

#### § § 1412.42

        (a) Producers eligible to enter into a contract are:

        (1) An owner of a farm who has an ownership share of a crop and who assumes all or a part of the risk of producing a crop that is commensurate with that claimed ownership share of the crop; or

        (2) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm with a share-rent lease for such farm, regardless of the length of the lease, if the owner of the farm enters into the same contract; or

        (3) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such farm under a lease expiring on or after September 30 of the year of the contract in which case the owner is not required to enter into the contract; or

        (4) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such farm under a lease expiring before September 30 of the year of the contract. The owner of such farm must also enter into the same contract, failing which the farm is not enrolled; or

        (5) An owner of an eligible farm who cash rents such farm and the lease term expires before September 30 of the year of the contract, if the tenant declines to enter into a contract for the applicable year. In the case of an owner covered by this paragraph, payments will not begin under the contract until the lease held by the tenant ends.

        (b) A minor child will be eligible to enter into a contract only if one of the following conditions exist:

        (1) The right of majority has been conferred upon the minor by court proceedings or law;

        (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and the applicable program documents are executed by the guardian; or

        (3) A bond is furnished under which a surety guarantees any loss incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an adult.

        (c) The owner of the farm may be considered the “producer” if there is no other producer, but the owner could have shared in the crop had a crop been produced, but only if the farm and owner otherwise meet all the requirements for payment.

#### § §§ 1412.44-1412.45

        § 1412.46   Planting flexibility.

#### § § 1412.46

        (a) Any crop may be planted and harvested on base acres on a farm, except as limited in this section. Any crop may be planted on cropland in excess of the base acres on a farm.

        (b) Base acres may be hayed or grazed at any time.

        (c) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the planting or harvesting of perennial or harvesting of non-perennial fruits, vegetables (except mung beans and covered commodities), or wild rice, as determined by FSA, will result in an acre for acre payment reduction when such crop or crops are planted and or harvested, as applicable, on more than:

        (1) 15 percent of the base acres of a farm enrolled in ARC or PLC using county coverage; or

        (2) 35 percent of the base acres of a farm enrolled in ARC using individual coverage.

        (d) For each crop year for which a reduction in payment acres is made according to paragraph (c) of this section, those acres will be considered to be P&CP to a covered commodity for the purpose of any adjustment or reduction of base acres for the farm.

        (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, perennial fruits, vegetables, and wild rice may be planted or harvested on base acres of a farm and non-perennial fruits, vegetables, and wild rice may be harvested on base acres of a farm if a producer double-crops fruits, vegetables, or wild rice with a covered commodity in any region described in paragraph (f) of this section, in which case payment acres will not be reduced for the planting or harvesting of the fruit, vegetable, or wild rice.

        (f) Double-cropping for purposes of this section means planting for harvest non-perennial fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on the same acres in cycle with a planted covered commodity harvested for grain in a 12-month period under normal growing conditions for the region and being able to repeat the same cycle in the following 12-month period. For purposes of this part, the following counties have been determined to be regions having a history of double-cropping covered commodities or peanuts with fruits, vegetables, or wild rice.

        (g) The acreage of any fruit or vegetable specified in paragraph (i) of this section will first be attributed to cropland not having base acres, followed by base acres, before applying any payment acreage reduction required by paragraph (c) of this section. The reduction will be attributed to each of the covered commodities on the farm having payment acres on a pro rata basis to reflect the ratio of the payment acres of the covered commodity on the farm to the total payment acres of all covered commodities on the farm.

        (h) For the purposes of this part, fruits, vegetables, and wild rice planted on payment acres of a farm under ARC or PLC Program contract:

        (1) Will be considered harvested at the time of planting, unless the producer pays a fee to cover the cost of a farm visit, as specified in part 718 of this title, to verify that the fruit, vegetable, or wild rice has been destroyed before harvest, as determined by FSA; or

        (2) Will not be considered as planted to a fruit, vegetable, or wild rice when reported by a producer on the farm with an intended use of green manure or forage, as determined by FSA, and a fee to cover the cost of a farm visit is paid by the producer, as specified in part 718 of this title, to verify that the crop has not been harvested.

        (i) Unless otherwise specifically included as a covered commodity as specified in this part, fruits and vegetables include, but are not limited to, all nuts except peanuts, certain fruit-bearing trees and: Acerola (barbados cherry), antidesma, apples, apricots, aragula, ariona (chokeberry), artichokes, asparagus, atemoya (custard apple), avocados, babaco papayas, bananas, beans (except soybeans, mung, adzuki, faba, and lupin), beets—other than sugar, blackberries, blackeye peas, blueberries, bok spare choy, boysenberries, breadfruit, broccoflower, broccolo-cavalo, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cailang, caimito, calabaza, carambola (star fruit), calaboose, carob, carrots, cascadeberries, cauliflower, celeriac, celery, chayote, cherimoyas (sugar apples), canary melon, cantaloupes, cardoon, casaba melon, cassava, cherries, chinese bitter melon, chicory, chinese cabbage, chinese mustard, chinese water chestnuts, chufes, citron, citron melon, coffee, collards, cowpeas, crabapples, cranberries, cressie greens, crenshaw melons, cucumbers, currants, cushaw, daikon, dasheen, dates, dry edible beans, dunga, eggplant, elderberries, elut, endive, escarole, etou, feijoas, figs, gai lien, gailon, galanga, genip, gooseberries, grapefruit, grapes, guambana, guavas, guy choy, honeydew melon, huckleberries, jackfruit, jerusalem artichokes, jicama, jojoba, kale, kenya, kiwifruit, kohlrabi, kumquats, leeks, lemons, lettuce, limequats, limes, lobok, loganberries, longon, loquats, lotus root, lychee (litchi), mandarins, mangos, marionberries, mar bub, melongene, mesple, mizuna, mongosteen, moqua, mulberries, murcotts, mushrooms, mustard greens, nectarines, ny Yu, okra, olallieberries, olives, onions, opo, oranges, papaya, paprika, parsnip, passion fruits, peaches, pears, peas, all peppers, persimmon, persian melon, pimentos, pineapple, pistachios, plantain, plumcots, plums, pomegranates, potatoes, prunes, pummelo, pumpkins, quinces, radicchio, radishes, raisins, raisins (distilling), rambutan, rape greens, rapini, raspberries, recao, rhubarb, rutabaga, santa claus melon, salsify, saodilla, sapote, savory, scallions, shallots, shiso, spinach, squash, strawberries, suk gat, swiss chard, sweet corn, sweet potatoes, tangelos, tangerines, tangos, tangors, taniers, taro root, tau chai, teff, tindora, tomatillos, tomatoes, turnips, turnip greens, watercress, watermelons, white sapote, yam, and yam yu choy.

        § 1412.49   Matters of general applicability.

#### § § 1412.49

        (a) The regulations in this part and FSA and CCC's interpretation of the regulations in this part and internal agency directives issued to FSA State and county offices are matters of general applicability and are not individually appealable in administrative appeals according to §§ 11.3 and 780.5 of this title. Additionally, the regulations in this part and any decisions of CCC and FSA that are not based on specific facts derived from an individual participant's application, contract, or file are not appealable under part 11 or part 780 of this title. Examples of such decisions include how the program is generally administered, signup deadlines, payment rates, or any other generally applicable matter or determination that is made by CCC or FSA for use in all similarly situated applications. The only extent by which the matters referenced in this section are reviewable administratively in an appeal forum is whether FSA's or CCC's decision to apply the generally applicable matter is factually accurate and in conformance with the regulations in this part.

        (b) The relief provisions of 7 CFR part 718 are applicable only to ineligibility and noncompliance decisions. The relief provisions cannot be used to extend a benefit or assistance not otherwise available under law or not otherwise available to others who have satisfied or complied with every eligibility or compliance requirement of the provisions of this part. Equitable relief provisions of part 718 of this title cannot be used to obtain a review of either these regulations, the requirements of this part, the agency's interpretations of this part, or compliance provisions of this part.

        § 1412.50   Transfer of land and succession-in-interest.

#### § § 1412.50

        (a) Land subject to an election in subpart G will continue to be subject to the election even if there is a transfer of land or change in interest of any producer or owners on the farm. If a new owner or operator or producer purchases or obtains the right and interest in, or right to occupancy of, the land subject to an election option, such new owner or operator or producer, upon the approval of FSA, may enroll and participate under a new contract with FSA with respect to such transferred land in accordance with § 1412.41.

        (b) A succession in interest to an ARC or PLC program contract is required if there has been a change in the operation of a farm such as:

        (1) A sale of land;

        (2) A change of operator or producer, including a change in a partnership that increases or decreases the number or changes who are partners;

        (3) A foreclosure, bankruptcy, or involuntary loss of the farm;

        (4) A change in the producer shares to reflect changes in the producer's share of the crop(s) that were originally approved on the contract; or

        (5) Another change as otherwise determined by the Deputy Administrator by which the succession will not adversely affect nor defeat the purpose of the program.

        (c) A succession in interest to an ARC program contract is not permitted if FSA determines that the change:

        (1) Is not for all the time remaining under the ARC or PLC program contract;

        (2) Results in a violation of the landlord-tenant provisions specified in § 1412.55; or

        (3) Adversely affects or otherwise defeats the purpose of the program.

        (d) If a producer who is entitled to receive ARC or PLC payments dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 707 of this title.

        (e) A producer or owner of an enrolled farm must inform the county committee of changes in interest in base acres on the farm not later than:

        (1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change requires a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title or

        (2) September 30 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change does not require a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title.

        (f) In any case in which either an ARC or PLC payment has previously been made to a predecessor, such payment will not be paid to the successor, unless such payment has been refunded in full by the predecessor, in accordance with § 1412.41(d).

      Subpart E—Financial Considerations Including Sharing Payments

        § 1412.51   Limitation of payments.

#### § § 1412.51

        (a) The provisions of part 1400 of this chapter apply to this part. Payments under this part cannot exceed the amounts specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        (b) For all covered commodities other than peanuts, the total amount of ARC and PLC payments received, directly or indirectly, by a person or legal entity (except a joint venture or general partnership) for any crop year   for any and all commodities cannot exceed $125,000.

        (c) For peanuts, the total amount of payments received, directly or indirectly, by a person or legal entity (except a joint venture or general partnership) for any crop year cannot exceed $125,000.

        (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a producer on a farm is not eligible to receive ARC and PLC payments if the sum of the base acres on the farm is 10 acres or less unless the sum of the base acres on the farm, when combined with the base acres of other farms in which the producer has an enrolled producer share interest greater than zero, is more than 10 acres. The 10-acre limitation of this section will not apply to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher, a beginning farmer or rancher, a veteran farmer or rancher, or a limited resource farmer or rancher.

        (e) Any person or legal entity interested in obtaining a payment under this part for a crop year, in addition to satisfying all eligibility requirements of this part, must submit any and all documents from which payment eligibility can be determined to FSA by March 1 of the second year after the end of the annual contract period for which payments are being made. For example, to obtain a payment for a 2019 contract, which ends in calendar year 2020, all documents must be submitted to FSA by March 1, 2021. This includes any payment eligibility document required under part 12 or part 1400 of this title. For example, for the 2019 contract year, the final date for submission of documents from which payment eligibility will be determined and apply is March 1, 2021. Payments will not issue to any person or legal entity who fails to submit required forms and documents by this date. Further these payments will not be considered denied, as the person or legal entity is presumed to have forfeited their interest in the payment.

        § 1412.52   PLC payment provisions.

#### § § 1412.52

        (a) Provided all provisions of this part including but not limited to election have been satisfied for a contract year, a PLC payment will be made to eligible participants on a farm enrolled in PLC with respect to covered commodities for which a PLC yield and base acres are established:

        (1) When the effective price for a covered commodity in a crop year is less than the effective reference price for the PLC enrolled covered commodity for that crop year as specified in this part; and

        (2) As soon as practical, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, after October 1 following the end of the 12-month marketing year for the covered commodity as applicable.

        (b) The effective price for a covered commodity is equal to the higher of the:

        (1) MYA price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the crop year of the covered commodity, as determined by FSA, or

        (2) National loan rate for a marketing assistance loan for the covered commodity for such crop year.

        (c) The payment rate used to calculate PLC payments with respect to covered commodity for which PLC yields and base acres are attributed to the covered commodity on a farm enrolled in a PLC contract is the effective reference price of the covered commodity minus the effective price of the covered commodity for a crop year, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d) For PLC contracts, when PLC payments are triggered in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the limitation in § 1412.51 and in part 1400 of this chapter, the PLC payment to be paid to producers on a farm enrolled in a contract with respect to a covered commodity for which a PLC yield and base acres are attributed is equal to the product of:

        (1) The payment rate determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, multiplied by

        (2) The relevant payment acres of the covered commodity, as applicable, minus any payment acre reduction in accordance with § 1412.46, multiplied by

        (3) The PLC payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm enrolled in a PLC contract as determined in accordance with § 1412.31, minus

        (4) Any reduction calculated in accordance with subpart F of this part.

        (e) If a producer declines to accept, has forfeited interest in the payment as specified under § 1412.51, or is determined to be ineligible for all or any part of the producer's share of the PLC payment computed for the farm in accordance with the provisions of this section, the:

        (1) Payment or portions thereof will not become available for any other producer and

        (2) Producer is required to refund to CCC any amounts representing payments that exceed the payments determined by FSA to have been earned under the program authorized by this part. Part 1403 of this chapter is applicable to all unearned payments.

        (f) The payment of any amount due any producer on a farm enrolled in a PLC contract will be made only after all the producers subject to the contract are determined to be in full compliance with the contract and the requirements in this part or any other applicable part.

        (g) A participant on a farm enrolled in a contract may receive a payment amount due without regard to the eligibility of other participants on the farm if the:

        (1) Participant is in full compliance with the contract and the requirements in this part or any other applicable part;

        (2) Payment of such amount does not adversely affect or defeat the purpose of the program, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, or designee; and

        (3) Payment is approved by the Deputy Administrator, or designee.

        (h) Temperate japonica rice or medium and short grain rice grown:

        (1) In California will receive the effective price and guarantee for medium and short grain based only on the prices that temperate japonica or medium and short grain rice receives in California.

        (2) Outside of California will receive the effective price and guarantee for medium and short grain rice based only on the prices that temperate japonica or medium and short grain rice receives outside of California.

        § 1412.53   ARC payment provisions.

#### § § 1412.53

        (a) Effective with the 2019 and subsequent crop years, ARC-CO actual crop revenue and guarantee will be based on the physical location of base acres of the farm.

        (1) FSA will divide up to 25 counties into administrative units. Each of the resulting administrative unit will be viewed as a county for ARC-CO payment purposes.

        (2) If a farm has base acres physically located in more than one physical location county, the ARC-CO actual revenue and ARC-CO guarantee will be weighted and summarized to the farm level.

        (3) If determined applicable by FSA, a historical irrigated percentage and trend-adjusted yield factor will be used to determine guarantee and revenue, which will also be weighted and summarized to the farm level.

        (b) Provided all provisions of this part, including but not limited to ARC-CO election and enrollment, have been satisfied for the contract year, CCC will issue, as applicable and consistent with the election and enrollment:

        (1) An ARC-CO payment beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the covered commodity to the producers on a farm for a covered commodity in each crop year if the farm and covered commodity were enrolled in ARC-CO and the farm's weighted and summarized ARC-CO actual crop revenue was less than the farm's weighted and summarized ARC-CO guarantee.

        (2) Payment is equal to the result of multiplying the payment acres for the covered commodity times the difference between the farm's weighted and summarized actual crop revenue and the ARC-CO guarantee, not to exceed 10 percent of the farm's weighted and summarized ARC-CO benchmark revenue.

        (c) In a county having farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2013 through 2017, where a covered commodity's P&CP acreage was both irrigated and non-irrigated in 2013 through 2017, a separate irrigated and non-irrigated benchmark revenue, guarantee, and actual revenue will be maintained by FSA for the affected county. For farms in those counties with covered commodities enrolled in ARC-CO, the average 2013 through 2017 reported acreage of each covered commodity on the farm with irrigated and non-irrigated status will be used by FSA to calculate a percentage of each applicable covered commodity that will be applied against the irrigated and non-irrigated benchmark revenue, guarantee, and actual revenue.

        (d) FSA has determined the irrigated and non-irrigated counties and crops for the 2019 program year.

        (e) Provided all provisions of this part, including but not limited to ARC-IC election and enrollment, have been satisfied for the contract year, CCC will issue, as applicable and consistent with the election and enrollment:

        (1) An ARC-IC payment beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the farm if the farm was enrolled in ARC-IC and the ARC-IC actual crop revenue for that farm is less than the ARC-IC guarantee.

        (2) Payment is equal to the result of multiplying the payment acres for the covered commodities times the difference between actual crop revenue and the ARC-IC guarantee, not to exceed 10 percent of benchmark revenue for ARC-IC.

        (f) If a producer has an interest in multiple farms that have enrolled in ARC-IC, the ARC-IC benchmark revenue for that producer used in the payment calculation will be a weighted average of the benchmark revenue for those multiple farms.

        (g) The effective price and guarantee for temperate japonica rice will be based on the price that all medium and short grain (including glutinous) rice receives in California. The effective price and guarantee for medium grain rice outside California will be based on the price that all medium and short grain rice receives outside California.

        § 1412.54   Sharing of payments.

#### § § 1412.54

        (a) Each eligible producer on a farm may enroll in an ARC or PLC contract, as applicable, and receive assistance and payments determined to be fair and equitable as agreed to by all the producers on the farm and approved by the county committee.

        (b) When required by FSA, each person or legal entity leasing a farm who enrolls in ARC or PLC must provide a copy of their written lease to the county committee and, in the absence of a written lease, must provide to the county committee a complete written description of the terms and conditions of any oral agreement or lease.

        (1) If a farm is cash leased (that is, the landowner receives a zero share of covered commodities planted on the farm or a zero share of any base acres) and the producers on the farm cash leased the farm in the immediately preceding year, then the tenant(s) who enters a producer signature and has a share greater than zero on the contract, if the same was true for the immediately preceding year, is considered to have satisfied ARC and PLC Program requirements of landowner(s) signing to a zero share on the contract The evidence must have been submitted for the immediately preceding contract year or was referred to in that contract year to an immediately preceding contract year.

        (2) When required by FSA, an owner's or landlord's signature affirming a zero share on either an application for assistance or contract under this part, as applicable, may be accepted as evidence of a cash lease between the owner or landlord and tenant.

        (3) For the purposes of obtaining payments under this part, the signature or signatures, if entered on the contract to satisfy the requirement of furnishing a written lease, are required to be provided by the enrollment deadline established by CCC for the assistance or payment.

        (c) When land on which base acres is leased on a share basis, neither the landlord nor the tenant is eligible to receive 100 percent of the ARC or PLC contract payment for the farm.

        (d) CCC will approve an ARC or PLC contract for enrollment and approve the division of payment when CCC is satisfied and determines that all of the following apply:

        (1) The landlords, tenants, and sharecroppers sign the contract and agree to the payment shares shown on the contract;

        (2) The interests of tenants and sharecroppers are being protected; and

        (3) The payment shares shown on the application or contract do not circumvent either the provisions of this part or the provisions of part 1400 of this chapter.

        (4) If any civil dispute between persons, legal entities, or members of legal entities not involving FSA or CCC is known or suspected to exist that either FSA or CCC believes might impact the eligibility of any person or legal entity or administration of ARC or PLC under this part, the Deputy Administrator can elect to withhold making any determination on an application or contract until such time as the Deputy Administrator is satisfied that the dispute is resolved or no longer has any bearing on either the administration of ARC or PLC under this part or any eligible producer or potential eligible producer. A decision withheld under to this paragraph will not be construed to be a decision or adverse decision under any law or regulation nor will it be construed to be a failure of FSA or CCC to act under any law or regulation.

        (e) A lease will be considered to be a cash lease if the lease provides for only a guaranteed cash payment for a specified amount, or a fixed quantity of the crop (for example, pounds, or bushels per acre).

        (1) If a lease contains provisions that require the payment of rent on the basis of the amount of crop produced or the proceeds derived from the crop, or the interest such producer would have had if the crop had been produced, or combination thereof, the agreement will be considered to be a share lease.

        (2) If a lease provides for a guaranteed amount and a share of the crop or crop proceeds, the agreement will be considered a cash lease.

        (3) If the lease is a cash lease, the landlord is not eligible for assistance or payments under this part. The leasing of grazing or haying privileges is not considered cash leasing.

        (f) Shares of PLC and ARC-CO will be determined based on the shares entered on the contract. Shares of ARC-IC payments will be determined based on the shares recorded on the report of acreage filed as specified in § 1412.66. Further, each eligible producer having a share of planted or eligible subsequently planted crop acreage of covered commodities on a farm enrolled under an ARC or PLC Program contract has to do both of the following to be eligible for their share of a payment:

        (1) Unless otherwise already enrolled on the ARC or PLC Program contract, sign the ARC or PLC Program contract during the contract period; and

        (2) Have the producer's share recorded on the report of acreage filed as required by part 718 of this title and § 1412.66.

        (g) In a case where a producer has failed to sign an ARC or PLC Program contract by the signup deadline or contract period established for enrollment and participation for the producer's reported share of P&CP acres or eligible subsequently planted crop acreage of covered commodities on a farm enrolled as specified in this part, that producer's share will not receive any consideration for payment and will not generate any payment to the producer or to any other producer on the farm.

        (h) FSA's approval of an ARC or PLC contract or shares under this part on behalf of CCC based on the representations of persons or legal entities signing the ARC or PLC contract, or acreage report in no way implies or will be construed as FSA's determination that the representations or assertions made by persons or legal entities signing the ARC or PLC contract, or acreage report are correct or are approved as legitimate. Any and all assertions and representations of a person, persons, legal entity, or legal entities signing forms, applications, or contracts incidental to program participation in this part are always subject to review and scrutiny or spot check by CCC. On CCC's behalf, FSA can at any time demand documentation to substantiate any representation made by any program participant under this part and recover unearned amounts that are determined to have been paid based on such erroneous representation.

#### § § 1412.55

        (a) No payment or assistance authorized under this part will be made by CCC if:

        (1) The landlord or operator has adopted a scheme or device for the purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which such person would otherwise be entitled under ARC or PLC. If any of such conditions occur or are discovered after payments have been made, all or any such part of the payments as the State committee may determine are required to be refunded to CCC; or

        (2) The landlord terminated a lease in violation of State law as determined by a State court.

        § 1412.61   Contract violations.

#### § § 1412.61

        Violations of contract or application requirements will result in the termination or cancellation of the ARC or PLC contract. Upon such termination or cancellation, all producers that signed the contract or application forfeit all rights to receive payments for the ARC or PLC contract and are required to refund all payments received, plus interest as specified in § 1412.1(d) of this part, as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.

        § 1412.64   Inaccurate representation, misrepresentation, and scheme or device.

#### § § 1412.64

        (a) Producers are required to accurately report and certify information provided to CCC for ARC or PLC. Any form containing the signature of a person or legal entity that contains a preprinted certification statement on the form will be construed to be a representation and certification of and from the person or legal entity signing the form regardless of whether or not the person or legal entity personally made the entry or entries on the form. Errors in reporting may impact eligibility or extent of eligibility. Payments under this part will be based on the most correct information available. CCC's issuing payments based on the face of a contract does not signify CCC's approval of the representations made by participants. Producers are responsible for refunding, with interest as specified in § 1412.1(d) of this part, any program benefits that were paid based on incorrect program information.

        (b) For those cases in which FSA determines that an inaccurate representation or certification is due to a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, the person or legal entity or members of the legal entity will be ineligible to receive ARC or PLC payments and will have the person, legal entity's or member's interest in all contracts or applications terminated if it is determined that such person, legal entity, or member of the legal entity has done any of the following:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of this part;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation;

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting an ARC or PLC Program contract or determination made under part 1400 of this chapter; or

        (4) Violated or been determined ineligible under § 1400.5 of this chapter.

        (c) Any remedies taken by FSA or CCC as specified in this section will be in addition to any other civil or other remedies that may be available, including, but not limited to, those provided in part 1400 of this chapter.

The regulations governing offsets and withholdings in part 1403 of this chapter apply to contract payments.

        (b) Any participant entitled to any payment may assign any payments in accordance with regulations governing the assignment of payments in part 1404 of this chapter.

        § 1412.66   Acreage and production reports, prevented planting, and notices of loss.

#### § § 1412.66

        (a) An accurate report of all cropland acreage on the farm is required for ARC or PLC.  How to submit the acreage report is specified in part 718 of this title.

        (b) Prevented planting acreage credit will only be available to acreage that CCC determines was prevented from being planted due to an eligible cause of loss. Acreage ineligible for prevented planted credit includes acreage not planted due to a management decision. Prevented planting acreage credit is subject to the provisions of part 718 of this title.

        (c) As a condition of producer payment eligibility for all ARC-IC payments under this part, all producers of all covered commodities on enrolled ARC-IC elected farms must accurately submit a report of production by the acreage reporting date for the crop in the year immediately following the crop year of the reported crop acreage for all the covered commodities elected and enrolled in ARC-IC. The report is due for each covered commodity for which an acreage report greater than zero planted acres was filed for the farm according to paragraph (a) of this section. The report of production for all of such covered commodity or covered commodities can be submitted by any of the producers of the covered commodity or covered commodities on the farm, the farm operator, or an owner on the farm. The absence of the required production report of any covered commodity being filed on an enrolled ARC-IC elected farm will cause all of the producers who share in any of the covered commodities on that farm to be ineligible for payment on that farm and on any other ARC-IC elected and enrolled farm in the State for the crop year for which the production report was not filed or is missing. At the discretion of CCC, the report of production must be accompanied by documentation acceptable to CCC. The report must include the date harvest was completed. Records of production acceptable to CCC may include those specified in:

        (1) Commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, or load summaries of the crop that was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined by CCC; and

        (2) Such documentary evidence such as contemporaneous measurements, truck scale tickets, and contemporaneous diaries, as is necessary in order to verify the information provided if the crop has been fed to livestock or otherwise disposed of other than through commercial channels, provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined by CCC. If the crop will be disposed of through retail sales, such as roadside stands, u-pick, etc. and the producer will not be able to certify acceptable records of production, the producer must request an appraisal of the crop acreage prior to harvest.

      Subpart G—ARC and PLC Election

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 57720, Sept. 26, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1412.71   Election of ARC or PLC.

#### § § 1412.71

        (a) For the 2019 though 2023 crop years, subject to paragraph (f) of this section, all of the producers on a farm must make a one-time election in the 2019 enrollment and election period that is both:

        (1) Unanimous, and

        (2) Irrevocable through 2020.

        (b) The election by producers is to obtain—

        (1) Either PLC or ARC-CO on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis on the farm; or

        (2) ARC-IC for all covered commodities on the farm.

        (c) In general, a valid election will also apply to any subsequent year parent to the farm reconstitution as well as farms resulting from the parent farm as specified in § 1412.73. Neither the requesting of a farm reconstitution nor the reconstitution of any farm will impact either the requirement that all producers on a farm must make the unanimous irrevocable election in the defined election period or the valid election that was previously made by those producers.

        (d) FSA will process elections from producers on a farm based on the election as submitted. For example, if the producers of a farm attest that they are all or the only producers on the farm and FSA later learns that there was another producer at the time of election who did not agree to the election, the election is invalid. If at any time FSA determines that an election fails to satisfy the requirements of this subpart because it did not include the unanimous agreement of all producers on the farm at the time of election, the election will immediately be invalid. This is not a compliance provision. Only valid elections by all producers will be recognized and used by CCC. All ARC and PLC payments that were issued to any producers on a farm based on an election later determined by CCC to be invalid, for whatever reason, regardless of whether those producers who were issued unearned payments personally made or participated in the invalid election, must be refunded with interest.

        (e) Even if completed during the same period of time, election is separate from enrollment; producers on farms that have validly completed an election in the prescribed election period must enroll as specified in subpart D of this part for ARC and PLC payments, as applicable.

        (f) Except for those farms specified under § 1412.26, for the 2021 and each subsequent crop year, all the producers on a farm may change the election under paragraph (a) of this section.

> [79 FR 46339, Aug. 8, 2014, as amended at 83 FR 40659, Aug. 16, 2018; 84 FR 45894, Sept. 3, 2019]

        § 1412.72   Election period.

#### § § 1412.72

        (a) Election will be conducted in a defined period as announced by FSA. During the election period, all producers on a farm must unanimously make the irrevocable election as described in § 1412.71 to preserve the payment eligibility for 2019 and determine whether the default election under § 1412.74 will apply to the farm.

        (b) If an election is submitted by all producers on a farm as specified in § 1412.71 and paragraph (a) of this section, that election will be recognized as valid for the farm unless any of the following occur:

        (1) The election is rescinded or terminated by any producer on the farm in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section during the election period;

        (2) The valid election is modified and replaced by another valid election by all producers during the election period;

        (3) A subsequent valid election by all producers is made with FSA during the election period; or

        (4) FSA determines the election at the time it was made was invalid for any reason.

        (c) At any time during an election period, a producer can rescind or terminate an election by providing written notice to FSA during the election period. The written notice to rescind or terminate must be physically received by FSA for CCC during the election period in order to be recognized. Immediately following receipt of such notice to rescind or terminate, the farm will be viewed as not having any effective valid election (in other words, no valid election will be determined to exist—even if there was another previous election in effect before the election that is rescinded, or terminated as specified in with this paragraph).

        (d) FSA is under no obligation to notify producers or owners on a farm that an election has been submitted, filed, rescinded, or terminated. Producers of a farm are solely responsible for filing a valid election during an election period or in whatever time remains in an election period following the rescission or termination of an election.

        (e) FSA is under no obligation to notify producers or owners of whether or not a valid election exists or is in place or whether any producer has rescinded or terminated an election. FSA will respond to inquiries regarding the status of election of a farm by any producer or owner on a farm including a producer or owner who gains a producer or owner interest on the farm during the election period.

        (f) The election period and final day in that election period in which producers can unanimously and irrevocably elect are not a compliance requirement or provision. The requirement of an election is mandated in the 2014 Farm Bill, as amended and as such is not subject to any of the equitable relief provisions of 7 CFR part 718, subpart D. Further, because the requirement of a unanimous irrevocable election and ramifications for not having a valid election are specified in the 2014 Farm Bill, as amended FSA will not consider any equitable relief. There are no late-file provisions for election.

        § 1412.73   Reconstitutions of farms and election.

#### § § 1412.73

        (a) If a new producer or new owner gains an interest in a farm after the filing of a valid election on that farm during the election period, that new producer or new owner, whether or not known to FSA or the other producers or owners on the farm, will be subject to any previously submitted valid election under §§ 1412.71 and 1412.72 unless that new producer or new owner modifies, rescinds, or terminates the election as a producer or owner as specified in § 1412.72(c) during the remaining time in the election period.

        (b) Any reconstitution request initiated after August 1, 2019, will not be made until after the end of the election period specified in § 1412.72. Following the close of the election period in § 1412.72, a valid election on any farm cannot be changed by any reconstitution. This means that valid elected farms can only be combined with farms having an identical election for each and every covered commodity on the farm regardless of whether there are any base acres for any and all covered commodities on the farm. Reconstitutions will not be permitted to alter a valid election or the default election that may apply to a farm.

      Subpart H—CTAP

        § 1412.81   Administration.

#### § § 1412.81

        (a) The provisions of this part apply to this subpart, except for provisions that apply specifically to ARC and PLC only, for example, the yield and planting flexibility provisions apply specifically to ARC and PLC. To the extent that there is a conflict with the provisions of other subparts of this part and this subpart, the provisions of this subpart apply to CTAP.

        (b) CTAP payments as specified in this subpart will be made available for:

        (1) The 2014 crop year to eligible producers on farms in all counties; and

        (2) The 2015 crop year to eligible producers on farms only in counties where STAX is not available.

        § 1412.82   Eligibility and CTAP application.

#### § § 1412.82

        (a)  In addition to any general eligibility provisions in this part, to be eligible for CTAP the following conditions are required:

        (2) The producer is on a farm that has cotton base acres that were in existence as of September 30, 2013, as adjusted; and

        (3) The producer has an interest in the upland cotton base acres on the farm.

        (b)  A producer's share interest in cropland on a farm must be equal to or greater than that producer's share interest in cotton base acres on the farm for that crop year, as reported on that farm's acreage report.

        (c)  To apply, submit the application and supportive and necessary contractual documents to the FSA county office:

        (1) For 2014 CTAP by October 7, 2014; and

        § 1412.83   Sharing of CTAP payments.

#### § § 1412.83

        (a) Each eligible producer on a farm may apply for and receive CTAP payments determined to be fair and equitable as agreed to by all producers on the farm and as approved by the county committee.

        (b) The provisions of § 1412.54 regarding the classification of leases apply to CTAP.

        (c) Shares of CTAP payments will be determined based on shares recorded on the application for CTAP payments for the particular program year. The provisions of § 1412.54 apply to shares of CTAP payments.

        § 1412.84   Impact of CTAP application on ARC or PLC.

#### § § 1412.84

        (a) Applications for CTAP do not establish eligibility for ARC or PLC. Interested producers are required to file documents that are specifically required for CTAP as specified on the CTAP application. An application for CTAP will not be considered an intent to participate in ARC or PLC and, conversely, an election or enrollment in ARC or PLC will not establish eligibility for CTAP.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 1412.86   CTAP payments.

#### § § 1412.86

        (a) In the case of producers on a farm who apply for CTAP as specified in this part, and where all other eligibility provisions have been satisfied, CCC will make CTAP payments available to the producers on a farm's application as specified in this subpart.

        (b) CTAP payments for upland cotton producers on farms with eligible upland cotton base acres as specified in § 1412.82(a) are equal to:

        (1) For 2014, the product of multiplying 60 percent of the farm's upland cotton base acres, times the farm's direct payment yield for upland cotton, times $0.09, times the producer's share on the approved application; or

        (2) Where applicable for 2015 according to this part and subpart, the product of multiplying 36.5 percent of the farm's upland cotton base acres, times the farm's direct payment yield for upland cotton, times $0.09, times the producer's share on the approved application.

        § 1412.87   Transfer of land and succession-in-interest.

#### § § 1412.87

        (a) A succession in interest application for CTAP is required if there has been a change in the producer shares of upland cotton base acres in § 1412.82(a) for 2014 or 2015, as applicable, due to:

        (1) A sale of land;

        (2) A change of producer, including a change in a partnership that increases or decreases the number of partners or changes who are partners;

        (3) A foreclosure, bankruptcy, or involuntary loss of the farm;

        (4) A change in producer shares to reflect changes in the producer's share of the upland cotton base acres relevant to the originally approved application; or

        (5) Any other change determined by the Deputy Administrator to be a succession that will not adversely affect or defeat the purpose of CTAP.

        (b) A succession in interest to the CTAP application is not permitted if CCC determines that the change:

        (1) Results in a violation of the landlord-tenant provisions specified in § 1412.55; or

        (2) Adversely affects or otherwise defeats the purpose of CTAP.

        (c) If a producer who is entitled to receive CTAP payments dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 707 of this title.

        (d) A producer or owner of an enrolled farm is required to inform the county committee of changes in interest in base acres of upland cotton as specified in § 1412.82(b) on the farm not later than:

        (1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change requires a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title; or

        (2) September 30 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change does not require a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title.

        (e) In any case in which a CTAP payment has previously been made to a predecessor, such payment will not be paid to the successor, unless such payment has been refunded in full by the predecessor.

        § 1412.88   Executed application not in conformity with regulations.

#### § § 1412.88

        If, after a CTAP application is approved by CCC, it is discovered that such any information contained in the application is not in conformity with the provisions of this part, the provisions of this part will prevail.

        § 1412.89   Division of CTAP payments and provisions relating to tenants and sharecroppers.

#### § § 1412.89

        (a) CTAP payments will be divided in the manner specified in the applicable application approved by CCC. CCC will ensure that 2014 or 2015 producers who would have a 2014 or 2015 reported share interest in cropland on the farm specified in § 1412.82(b) receive treatment that CCC deems to be equitable, as determined by CCC. CCC will refrain from acting on an application if, as determined by CCC, there is a disagreement among any person or legal entity applying as to the person's or legal entity's eligibility to apply as a tenant and there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether the person seeking participation as a tenant does or does not have a reported share interest in the cropland on the farm sufficient to cover the claimed share interest in cotton base acres of that farm as specified in § 1412.82(b) in 2014 or 2015, as applicable.

        (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from an application under this subpart and part when the operator or tenant:

        (1) Requests, in writing to be removed from the application;

        (2) Files for bankruptcy and the trustee or debtor in possession fails to affirm the application, to the extent permitted by the provisions of applicable bankruptcy laws;

        (3) Dies during the 2014 or 2015 program year and the Administrator of the estate fails to succeed to the application within a period of time determined by the Deputy Administrator; or

        (4) Is the subject of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction requiring the removal from the application under this part and subpart of the operator or tenant and such order is received by FSA, as determined by CCC.

        (c) In addition to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section, tenants are required to maintain their tenancy throughout the crop year in order to remain on an application. Tenants who fail to maintain tenancy on the acreage under the application, including failure to comply with provisions under applicable State law, may be removed from an application by CCC. CCC will assume the tenancy is being maintained unless notified otherwise by a participant specified in the application.

        (b) FSA representatives do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this subpart, except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (c) The State FSA committee will take any action required by the provisions of this subpart that the county FSA committee has not taken. The State FSA committee will also:

        (1) Correct, or require a county FSA committee to correct, any action taken by such county FSA committee that is not in compliance with the provisions of this subpart.

        (2) Require a county FSA committee to not take an action that is not in compliance with the provisions of this subpart.

        (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county FSA committee will preclude the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or a designee from determining any question arising under the program in this subpart, or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county FSA committee.

        (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county FSA committees to waive or modify non-statutory program requirements of this subpart in cases where failure to meet such requirements does not adversely affect operation of the program in this subpart. Producers have no right to seek an exception under this provision. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider cases or circumstances or decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this provision will not be considered an adverse decision and is not appealable.

        § 1413.104   Eligibility.

#### § § 1413.104

        (a) To be considered eligible for DWQP payments, the person or entity must have a share in the treated wheat crop on those acres planted to durum wheat on which an eligible fungicide was applied, as certified on the application, have incurred the cost of acquiring and applying eligible fungicide, and meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 1413.105   [Reserved]

#### § § 1413.105

        § 1413.106   Application process.

#### § § 1413.106

        (a) To apply for DWQP payment, the producer must submit, to the FSA county office that maintains the producer's farm records for the agricultural operation, a completed application as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, including any supporting documentation required by FSA, and a report of acreage.

        (b) The producer must submit a completed application for payment and required supporting documentation to the administrative FSA county office during the relevant, for the crop, application period announced by FSA which will end no later than September 15 of the crop year in which the fungicide was applied to a crop of durum wheat.

        (c) A complete application includes all of the following:

        (1) An application form provided by FSA;

        (2) Certification of the total number and location of acres planted to durum wheat on which an eligible fungicide was applied specifically to control Fusarium head blight;

        (3) Certification of the date durum wheat, on which an eligible fungicide was applied specifically to control Fusarium head blight, was planted;

        (4) Certification of the type of eligible fungicide applied to acres certified as planted to durum wheat;

        (5) Certification of the date eligible fungicide was applied to acres certified as planted to durum wheat;

        (d) The producer requesting benefits under this program certifies the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as any documentation filed with or in support of the application. All information provided is subject to verification by FSA.

        (e) Data furnished by the producer will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data program benefits will not be approved or provided.

        § 1413.107   Availability of funds.

#### § § 1413.107

        (a) The 2008 Farm Bill authorizes up to $10 million to be appropriated for each of the 2009 through 2012 fiscal years for DWQP. Payments will not be made for claims for a particular crop year until after the application deadline, which is September 15 of that crop year, for the crop for which payment for the fungicide application is sought and only if funds are made available through an appropriation.

        (b) In the event that approval of all eligible applications for fungicide treatments for a particular crop would result in expenditures in excess of the amounts appropriated for that crop year, the FSA Deputy Administrator will prorate the funds by a national factor to reduce the total expected payments to the amount made available by the Secretary. FSA will prorate the payments in such manner as it determines appropriate and reasonable.

        (c) Claims that are unpaid or paid at a reduced rate for a crop year for any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds for later crop years, unless provided for by law and approved by the Deputy Administrator. Such unpaid claims will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.

        § 1413.108   Payment calculation.

#### § § 1413.108

        (a) Subject to the availability of DWQP funds, the payment to an eligible producer will be the result of adding (adjusted for the producer's share of the crop):

        (1) The lesser of:

        (i) The result of multiplying the number of acres certified by the producer as planted to durum wheat on which an eligible fungicide was applied, during the flowering stage, times the per acre national fungicide acquisition payment rate as set by the Deputy Administrator; or

        (ii) Fifty percent of the producer's actual cost of purchasing eligible fungicide for acres certified as planted to durum wheat and treated for the applicable crop year in a manner that would otherwise generate a payment under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; plus

        (2) The result of multiplying the number of acres certified as planted to durum wheat on which an eligible fungicide was applied during the flowering stage, times the State application per-acre payment rate set by the State committee, with such application payment not to exceed 50 percent of the actual application cost certified to by the producer.

        (b) The national fungicide acquisition payment rate set by the Deputy Administrator will be based on 50 percent of the national average cost of eligible fungicide (only including the cost of the chemical itself), applied to one acre of durum wheat for the applicable crop year.

        (c) The State application payment rate set by the State committee will be based on 50 percent of the State average cost of applying an eligible fungicide to one acre of durum wheat for the applicable crop year.

        § 1413.109   Refunds, joint and several liability.

#### § § 1413.109

        (a) Excess payments, payments provided as the result of erroneous information provided by any person, or payments resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement or condition for payment in the application or this subpart, must be refunded to CCC.

        (b) A refund required as specified in this section will be due with interest from the date of CCC disbursement and otherwise determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and late payment charges as provided in part 1403 of this chapter.

        (c) Persons signing an application for payment as having an interest in an operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due as specified in this section.

        (d) Interest will be applicable to any refunds required as specified in parts 792 and 1403 of this title. Such interest will be charged at the rate that the U.S. Department of the Treasury charges CCC for funds, and will accrue from the date CCC made the erroneous payment to the date of repayment.

        (e) CCC may waive the accrual of interest if it determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action of the person, or was beyond the control of the person committing the violation. Any waiver is at the discretion of CCC alone.

        § 1413.110   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1413.110

        (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions, or remedies as may apply, a producer will be ineligible for payment through the DWQP if the producer is determined by CCC to have:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program,

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation, or

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

        (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this subpart to any producer engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due and all charges including interest will run from the date of disbursement of the CCC funds. Any producer engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any producer receiving payment as specified in this subpart will be jointly and severally liable with other persons or producers involved in such claim for payment for any refund due as specified in this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this subpart will be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

        § 1413.111   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1413.111

        (a)  Any payment to any producer under this part will be made without regard to questions of title under State law, and without regard to any claim or lien against the commodity, or proceeds, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government.

        (b)  Any producer entitled to any payment may assign any payment(s) in accordance with regulations governing the assignment of payments in part 1404 of this chapter.

        (c)  CCC may offset or withhold any amount due to CCC from any benefit provided under this subpart in accordance with the provisions of part 1403 of this chapter and part 792 of this title.

        (d)  The provisions of part 12 of this title apply to this subpart. That part sets out certain conservation requirements as a general condition for farm benefits.

        (e)  The provisions of § 718.6 of this title, which generally limit program payment eligibility for persons who have engaged in certain offenses with respect to controlled substances, will apply to this part.

        § 1413.112   Appeals.

#### § § 1413.112

        (a)  Appeal regulations set forth at parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to determinations made under this subpart.

        (b)  CCC determinations and policies that are not limited to a specific individual producer's application are not to be construed to be individual program eligibility determinations or adverse decisions and are, therefore, not subject to administrative review or appeal under 7 CFR part 11 or part 780 of this title (but nothing in the regulations for this program will limit the ability of the National Appeals Division to decide its own jurisdiction under part 11). Such determinations include, but are not limited to, application periods, deadlines, crop years, prices, general statutory or regulatory provisions that apply to similarly situated producers, national average payment prices, and payment factors established by CCC for DWQP for which this subpart applies or similar matters requiring CCC determinations.

        § 1413.113   Deceased individuals or dissolved entities.

#### § § 1413.113

        (a) Payment may be made for an eligible application on behalf of an eligible producer who is now a deceased individual or is a dissolved entity if a representative who currently has authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the producer signs the application for payment.

        (b) Legal documents showing proof of authority to sign for the deceased individual or dissolved entity must be provided.

        (c) If a producer is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.

        § 1413.114   Records and inspections.

#### § § 1413.114

        (a) Any producer receiving DWQP payments, or any other legal entity or person who provides information for the purposes of enabling a producer to receive a DWQP payment, must:

        (1) Maintain any books, records, and accounts supporting the information for 3 years following the end of the year during which the request for payment was submitted, and

        (2) Allow authorized representatives of USDA and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, during regular business hours, to inspect, examine, and make copies of such books or records, and to enter the farm and to inspect and verify all applicable acreage in which the producer has an interest for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of information provided by or for the producer.

    PART 1415—GRASSLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM

### Part 1415

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 3838n-3838q.

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 73925, Nov. 29, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1415.1   Purpose.

#### § § 1415.1

      (a) The purpose of the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is to assist landowners and operators in protecting grazing uses and related conservation values by conserving and restoring grassland resources on eligible private lands through rental contracts, easements, and restoration agreements.

      (b) GRP emphasizes:

      (1) Supporting grazing operations;

      (2) Maintaining and improving plant and animal biodiversity; and

      (3) Protecting grasslands and shrublands from the threat of conversion to uses other than grazing.

      § 1415.2   Administration.

#### § § 1415.2

      (a) The regulations in this part set forth policies, procedures, and requirements for program implementation of GRP, as administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). The regulations in this part are administered under the general supervision and direction of the NRCS Chief and the FSA Administrator. These two agency leaders:

      (1) Concur in the establishment of program policy and direction, development of the national allocation formula, and development of broad national ranking criteria;

      (2) Use a national allocation formula to provide GRP funds to NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors that emphasizes support for grazing operations, biodiversity of plants and animals, and grasslands under the greatest threat of conversion to uses other than grazing. The national allocation formula may also include additional factors related to improving program implementation, as determined by the NRCS Chief and the FSA Administrator. The allocation formula may be modified periodically to change the emphasis of any factor(s) in order to address a particular natural resource concern, such as the precipitous decline of a population of a grassland-dependent bird(s) or animal(s);

      (3) Ensure the national, State, and local-level information regarding program implementation is made available to the public;

      (4) Consult with USDA leaders at the State level and other Federal agencies with the appropriate expertise and information when evaluating program policies and direction; and

      (5) Authorize NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors to determine how funds will be used and how the program will be implemented at the State level.

      (b) At the State level, the NRCS State Conservationist and the FSA State Executive Director are jointly responsible for:

      § 1415.4   Program requirements.

#### § § 1415.4

      (a) Except as provided for under § 1415.17, only landowners may submit applications for easements. For rental contracts, applicants must own or provide written evidence of control of the property for the duration of the rental contract.

      (b) The easement or rental contract will require that the area be maintained in accordance with GRP goals and objectives for the term of the easement or rental contract, including the conservation, protection, enhancement, and if necessary, restoration of the grassland functions and values.

      (c) All participants in GRP are required to implement a GRP management plan approved by NRCS. When an eligible entity holds the GRP easement, NRCS will develop GRP management plans with eligible entities. In cases where a participant receives ranking points on the basis of resource concerns other than grazing land concerns, all such resource concerns will be addressed in an applicable conservation plan.

      (d) The easement or rental contract must grant USDA or its representatives a right of ingress and egress to the easement or rental contract area. For easements, this access is legally described by the conservation easement deed and the GRP management plan. Access to rental contract areas is identified in the GRP management plan.

      (e) Easement participants are required to convey unencumbered title that is acceptable to the United States and provide consent or subordination agreements from each holder of a security or other interest in the land. The landowner must warrant that the easement granted the United States or eligible entity is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed acceptable by USDA.

      (f) Landowners are required to use a standard GRP conservation easement deed developed by USDA or developed by an eligible entity and approved by USDA under § 1415.17 of this part. The easement grants development rights, title, and interest in the easement area in order to protect grassland and other conservation values.

      (g) The program participant must comply with the terms of the easement or rental contract, and comply with all terms and conditions of the GRP management plan and any associated conservation plan or restoration agreement.

      (h) Easements and rental contracts allow, consistent with their terms and the program purposes, the following activities as outlined in the GRP management plan:

      (1) Common grazing practices, including maintenance and necessary conservation practices and activities ( prescribed grazing; upland wildlife habitat management; prescribed burning; fencing, watering, and feeding necessary for the raising of livestock; and related forage and seed production) on the land in a manner that is consistent with maintaining the viability of grassland, forb, and shrub species common to the locality;

      (2) Haying, mowing, or harvesting for seed production subject to appropriate restrictions, as determined by the State Conservationist, during the nesting season for birds in the local area that are in significant decline, or are conserved in accordance with Federal or State law;

      (3) Fire pre-suppression, rehabilitation, and construction of firebreaks;

      (4) Grazing related activities, such as fencing and livestock watering facilities;

      (5) Facilities for power generation through renewable sources of energy production provided the scope and scale of the footprint of the facility and associated infrastructure is consistent with program purposes as determined by USDA through analysis of the potential site-specific environmental effects; and

      (6) Other activities that USDA determines the manner, number, intensity, location, operation, and other features associated with the activity will not adversely affect the grassland resources or related conservation values protected under an easement or rental contract. This includes infrastructure development along existing right-of-ways where the easement deed allows the landowner to grant right-of-ways when it is determined by NRCS that granting such right-of-ways are in the public interest, that grassland resources and related conservation values will not be adversely impacted, and the landowner agrees to a restoration plan for the disturbed area as developed by NRCS, but at no cost to NRCS. This also includes undeveloped, passive, recreational uses such as hiking, camping, bird watching, hunting, and fishing as long as such uses, as determined by the grantee, do not impair the grazing uses and other conservation values.

      (i) Easement and rental contracts prohibit the following activities:

      (1) The production of crops (other than hay), orchards, vineyards, or other agricultural commodity that is inconsistent with maintaining grazing land and related conservation values; and

      (2) Except as permitted under a restoration plan, the conduct of any other activity that would be inconsistent with maintaining grazing uses and related conservation values protected under an easement or rental contract.

      (j) Rental contracts may be terminated by USDA without penalty or refund if the original participant dies, is declared legally incompetent, or is otherwise unavailable during the contract period.

      (k) Participants, with the agreement of USDA, may convert a rental contract to an easement, provided that funds are available and the project meets conditions established by USDA. Land cannot be enrolled in both a rental contract option and an easement enrollment option at the same time. The rental contract will be terminated prior to the date the easement is recorded in the local land records office.

      (l) Rental contract participants are required to suspend any existing cropland base and allotment history for the land under another program administered by the Secretary.

      (m) Easement participants are required to eliminate any existing cropland base and allotment history for the land under another program administered by the Secretary.

      § 1415.5   Land eligibility.

#### § § 1415.5

      (a) GRP is available on privately owned lands, which include private and Tribal land. Publicly owned land is not eligible.

      (b) Land is eligible for funding consideration if the State Conservationist determines that the land is:

      (1) Grassland, land that contains forbs or shrubland (including improved rangeland and pastureland) for which grazing is the predominant use; or

      (2) Located in an area that has been historically dominated by grassland, forbs, or shrubland, and the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee, determines that it is compatible with grazing uses and related conservation values, and

      (i) Could provide habitat for animal or plant populations of significant ecological value if the land is retained in its current use or is restored to a natural condition,

      (ii) Contains historical or archeological resources, or

      (iii) Would address issues raised by State, regional, and national conservation priorities.

      (c) Incidental lands, in conjunction with eligible land, may also be considered for enrollment to allow for the efficient administration of an easement or rental contract. Incidental lands may include relatively small areas that do not specifically meet the eligibility requirements, but as a part of the land unit, may contribute to grassland functions and values and related conservation values, or its inclusion may increase efficiencies in land surveying, easement management, and monitoring by reducing irregular boundaries.

      (d) Land will not be enrolled if the functions and values of the grassland are already protected under an existing contract, easement, or deed restriction, or if the land already is in ownership by an entity whose purpose is to protect and conserve grassland and related conservation values. This land becomes eligible for enrollment in GRP if the existing contract, easement, or deed restriction expires or is terminated, and the grassland values and functions are no longer protected.

      (e) Land on which gas, oil, earth, or other mineral rights exploration has been leased or is owned by someone other than the applicant may be offered for participation in the program. However, if an applicant submits an offer for an easement project, USDA will assess the potential impact that the third party rights may have upon the grassland resources. USDA reserves the right to deny funding for any application where there are exceptions to clear title on the property.

      § 1415.6   Participant eligibility.

#### § § 1415.6

      To be eligible to participate in GRP, an applicant, except as otherwise described in § 1415.17:

      (a) Must be a landowner for easement participation or be a landowner or have control of the eligible acreage being offered for rental contract participation;

      (b) Agree to provide such information to USDA that is necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes;

      (c) Meet the Adjusted Gross Income requirements in part 1400 of this chapter, unless exempted under part 1400 of this chapter; and

      (d) Meet the conservation compliance requirements found in part 12 of this title.

      § 1415.7   Application procedures.

#### § § 1415.7

      (a) Applicants, except as otherwise described under § 1415.17, may submit an application through a USDA Service Center for participation in GRP. Applications may be submitted throughout the year.

      (b) By filing an application for participation, the applicant consents to a USDA representative entering upon the land offered for enrollment for purposes of assessing the grassland functions and values and for other activities that are necessary for USDA to make an offer of enrollment. Generally, the applicant will be notified prior to a USDA representative entering upon their property.

      (c) Applicants submit applications that identify the duration of the easement or rental contract for which they seek to enroll their land. Rental contracts may be for the duration of 10-years, 15-years, or 20-years; easements may be permanent in duration or for the maximum duration authorized by State law.

      § 1415.8   Establishing priority for enrollment of properties.

#### § § 1415.8

      (a) USDA, at the national level, will provide to NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors, national guidelines for establishing State-specific ranking criteria for selection of applications for funding.

      (b) NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors, with advice from State Technical Committees, establish criteria to evaluate and rank applications for easement and rental contract enrollment, including applications from eligible entities under § 1415.17, following the guidance established in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) Ranking criteria will emphasize support for:

      (1) Grazing operations;

      (2) Protection of grassland, land that contains forbs, and shrubland at the greatest risk from the threat of conversion to uses other than grazing;

      (3) Plant and animal biodiversity; and

      (4) In ranking parcels offered by eligible entities, these additional criteria will also be considered—

      (i) Leveraging of non-Federal funds, and

      (ii) Entity contributions in excess of 50 percent of the purchase price, as defined in § 1415.3.

      (d) When funding is available, NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors will periodically select for funding the highest ranked applications, including applications from entities under § 1415.17, based on applicant and land eligibility and the State-developed ranking criteria.

      (e) NRCS State Conservationists and FSA State Executive Directors may establish separate ranking pools to address, for example, specific conservation issues raised by State, regional, and national conservation priorities.

      (f) The NRCS State Conservationist and FSA State Executive Director, with advice from the State Technical Committee, may emphasize enrollment of unique grasslands or specific geographic areas of the State.

      (g) The NRCS State Conservationist and the FSA State Executive Director, with advice from the State Technical Committee, will select applications for funding.

      (h) If available funds are insufficient to accept the highest ranked application, and the applicant is not interested in reducing the acres offered to match available funding, the State Conservationist or State Executive Director may select a lower ranked application that can be fully funded.

      (i) Land enrolled in a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contract that is within one year of the scheduled expiration date will receive a priority for enrollment. To receive this priority, the following criteria must be met:

      (1) The land must be eligible as defined in § 1415.5;

      (2) USDA, with advice from the State Technical Committee, must determine it is of high ecological value and under significant threat of conversion to uses other than grazing;

      (3) The land must be offered for easement or 20-year rental contract enrollment;

      (4) Expired CRP land enrolled under this priority will not exceed 10 percent of the total number of acres accepted for national enrollment in GRP in any year; and

      (5) This priority applies only up to 12 months before the scheduled expiration of the CRP contract.

      (j) USDA will manage the program nationally to ensure that, to the extent practicable, 60 percent of funds are used for the purchase of easements, either directly or through cooperative agreements with eligible entities as set forth in § 1415.17 and 40 percent of funds are used for rental contracts.

      § 1415.9   Enrollment of easements and rental contracts.

#### § § 1415.9

      (a) Based on the priority ranking, NRCS or FSA, as appropriate, will notify applicants in writing of their tentative acceptance into the program for either rental contract or conservation easement options. The letter notifies the applicant of the intent to continue the enrollment process unless otherwise notified by the applicant. Enrollment under cooperative agreements is described under § 1415.17.

      (b) An offer of tentative acceptance into the program neither binds USDA to acquire an easement or enter into a rental contract, nor binds the applicant to convey an easement, enter into a rental contract, or agree to restoration activities.

      (c) Offer of enrollment will be through either:

      (1) An agreement to purchase an easement presented by NRCS to the applicant which will describe the easement, the easement terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions that may be required by NRCS; or

      (2) A rental contract will be presented by FSA to the applicant which will describe the contract area, the contract terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions that may be required by FSA.

      (d) For rental contracts, land will be considered to be enrolled in GRP once an FSA representative approves the GRP rental contract. FSA may withdraw the offer before approval of the contract due to lack of available funds or other reasons.

      (e) For easements, after the option agreement to purchase an easement is executed by NRCS and the participant, the land will be considered enrolled in GRP. NRCS will proceed with the development of the GRP management plan, conservation or restoration plan if applicable, and various easement acquisition activities, which may include conducting a legal survey of the easement area, securing necessary subordination agreements, procuring title insurance, and conducting other activities necessary to record the easement or implement GRP.

      (f) Prior to closing an easement, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of available funds, title concerns, or other reasons.

      § 1415.10   Compensation for easements and rental contracts acquired by the Secretary.

#### § § 1415.10

      (a) The Chief will not pay more than the fair market value of the land, less the grazing value of the land encumbered by the easement.

      (b) To determine this amount, the Chief will pay as compensation the lowest of:

      (1) The fair market value of the land encumbered by the easement as determined by the Chief using—

      (i) The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, or

      (ii) An area-wide market analysis or market survey;

      (2) The amount corresponding to a geographical cap, as determined by the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee; or

      (3) An offer made by the landowner.

      (c) For 10-, 15-, and 20-year rental contracts, the participant will receive not more than 75 percent of the grazing value in an annual payment for the length of the contract, as determined by FSA. As provided by the regulations at part 1400 of this title, payments made under one or more rental contracts to a person or legal entity, directly or indirectly, may not exceed, in the aggregate, $50,000 per year.

      (d) In order to provide for better uniformity among States, the NRCS Chief and FSA Administrator may review and adjust, as appropriate, State or other geographically based payment rates for rental contracts.

      (e) Easement or rental contract payments received by a participant will be in addition to, and not affect, the total amount of payments that the participant is otherwise eligible to receive under other USDA programs.

      (f) Easement payments will be made in a single payment to the landowner unless otherwise requested by the landowner.

      (g) USDA may accept and use contributions of non-Federal funds to support the purposes of the program. These funds are available to USDA without further appropriation and until expended, to carry out the program.

      (h) USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation practices and activities funded through GRP, and that ecosystem credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a GRP easement, rental contract, or associated restoration agreement. USDA asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits except:

      (1) In the event the participant sells or trades credits arising from GRP funded activities, USDA retains the authority to ensure that the requirements for GRP rental contracts, easements, or restoration agreements are met and maintained consistent with this part; and

      (2) If activities required under an ecosystem credit agreement may affect land covered under a GRP rental contract, easement, or restoration agreement, participants are required to obtain an assessment from USDA about the compatibility of the activity prior to entering into such agreements.

      § 1415.11   Restoration agreements.

#### § § 1415.11

      (a) Restoration agreements are only authorized to be used in conjunction with easements and rental contracts. NRCS, in consultation with the program participant, determines if the grassland resources are adequate to meet the participant's objectives and the purposes of the program, or if a restoration agreement is needed. Such a determination is also subject to the availability of funding. USDA may condition participation in the program upon the execution of a restoration agreement depending on the condition of the grassland resources. When the functions and values of the grassland are determined adequate by NRCS, a restoration agreement is not required. However, if a restoration agreement is required, NRCS will set the terms of the restoration agreement. The restoration plan component of the restoration agreement identifies conservation practices and activities necessary to restore or improve the functions and values of the grassland to meet both USDA and the participant's objectives and purposes of the program. If the functions and values of the grassland decline while the land is subject to a GRP easement or rental contract through no fault of the participant, the participant may enter into a restoration agreement at that time to improve the functions and values with USDA approval and when funds are available.

      (b) The NRCS State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee and in consultation with FSA, determines the conservation practices and activities and the cost-share percentages, not to exceed statutory limits available under GRP. A list of conservation practices and activities approved for cost-share assistance under GRP restoration plans is available to the public through the local USDA Service Center. NRCS may work through the local conservation district with the program participant to determine the terms of the restoration plan. The conservation district may assist NRCS with determining eligible conservation practices and activities and approving restoration agreements.

      (c) Only approved conservation practices and activities are eligible for cost-sharing. Payments under the GRP restoration agreements may be made to the participant of not more than 50 percent for the cost of carrying out the conservation practices or activities. As provided by the regulations at part 1400 of this chapter, payments made under one or more restoration agreements to a person or legal entity, directly or indirectly, may not exceed, in the aggregate, $50,000 per year.

      (d) The participant is responsible for the operation and maintenance of conservation practices in accordance with the restoration agreement.

      (e) All conservation practices must be implemented in accordance with the FOTG.

      (f) Technical assistance is provided by NRCS, or an NRCS approved third party.

      (g) If the participant is receiving cost-share for the same conservation practice or activity from another conservation program, USDA will adjust the GRP cost-share rate proportionately so that the amount received by the participant does not exceed 100 percent of the costs of restoration.

      (h) The participant cannot receive cost-share from more than one USDA cost-share program for the same conservation practice or activity on the same land.

      (i) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by a qualified individual approved by the NRCS State Conservationist that an eligible restoration practice has been established in compliance with appropriate standards and specifications.

      (j) Conservation practices and activities identified in the restoration plan may be implemented by the participant or other designee.

      (k) Cost-share payments will not be made for conservation practices or activities implemented or initiated prior to the approval of a rental contract or easement acquisition unless a written waiver is granted by the NRCS State Conservationist or FSA State Executive Director, as appropriate, prior to installation of the practice.

      (l) Upon transfer of an easement with a restoration agreement to an eligible entity as described in § 1415.18, the entity will be responsible for administration of the agreement and providing funds for payment of any costs associated with the completion of the restoration agreement. The eligible entity may, with participant consent, revise an existing restoration agreement or develop a new restoration agreement. Restoration plans must be consistent with the GRP management plan or any associated conservation plan as described in § 1415.4.

      (m) Cooperating entities under § 1415.17 will be responsible for development, administration, and implementation costs of restoration plans.

      § 1415.12   Modifications to easements and rental contracts.

#### § § 1415.12

      (a) After an easement has been recorded, no substantive modification will be made to the easement. Modifications that would not result in acquisition or divestiture of additional property rights may be made.

      (b) State Conservationists may approve modifications for restoration agreements and GRP management plans or conservation plans where applicable, as long as the modifications do not affect the provisions of the easement and meet program objectives.

      (c) USDA may approve modifications to rental contracts, including corresponding changes to conservation plans, GRP management plans, and restoration plans to facilitate the practical administration and management of the enrolled area so long as the modification will not adversely affect the grassland functions and values for which the land was enrolled.

      § 1415.13   Transfer of land.

#### § § 1415.13

      (a) Any transfer of the property prior to an applicant's acceptance into the program will void the offer of enrollment, unless at the option of the State Conservationist or State Executive Director, as appropriate, an offer is extended to the new landowner and the new landowner agrees to the same easement or rental contract terms and conditions.

      (b) After acreage is accepted in the program, for easements with multiple payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original participant unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.

      (c) Future annual rental payments will be made to the successor participant.

      (d) The new landowner is responsible for complying with the terms of the recorded easement, and the contract successor is responsible for complying with the terms of the rental contract and for assuring completion of all activities and practices required by any associated restoration agreement. Eligible cost-share payments will be made to the new participant upon presentation that the successor assumed the costs of establishing the practices.

      (e) With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, the United States bears no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original participant and the participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, USDA may withhold payments, without the accrual of interest, pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.

      (f) The rights granted to the United States in an easement will apply to any of its agents or assigns. All obligations of the participant under the GRP conservation easement deed also bind the participant's heirs, successors, agents, assigns, lessees, and any other person claiming under them.

      (g) Rental contracts may be transferred to another landowner, operator, or tenant that acquires an interest in the land enrolled in GRP. The successor must be determined by FSA to be eligible to participate in GRP and must assume full responsibility under the contract. FSA may require a participant to refund all or a portion of any financial assistance awarded under GRP, plus interest, if the participant sells or loses control of the land under a GRP rental contract, and the new landowner, operator, or tenant is not eligible to participate in the program or declines to assume responsibility under the contract.

      § 1415.14   Misrepresentation and violations.

#### § § 1415.14

      (a) The following provisions apply to violations of rental contracts:

      (1) Rental contract violations, determinations, and appeals are handled in accordance with the terms of the rental contract;

      (2) A participant who is determined to have erroneously represented any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part may not be entitled to rental contract payments and must refund to CCC all payments, plus interest, in accordance with part 1403 of this title; and

      (3) In the event of a violation of a rental contract, the participant will be given notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as CCC may allow. Failure to correct the violation may result in termination of the rental contract.

      (b) The following provisions apply to violations of easement deeds:

      (1) Easement violations are handled under the terms of the easement deed;

      (2) Upon notification of the participant, NRCS has the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to monitor compliance with the terms of the GRP conservation easement deed or remedy deficiencies or violations;

      (3) When NRCS believes there may be a violation of the terms of the GRP conservation easement deed, NRCS may enter the property without prior notice; and

      (4) The participant will be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the participant's negligence or failure to comply with the easement terms and conditions.

      (c) USDA may require the participant to refund all or part of any payments received by the participant under the program contract or agreement.

      (d) In addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies available to the United States under applicable law, USDA may withhold any easement payment, rental payment, or cost-share payments owing to the participant at any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants, rental contract, or any contract. Such withheld funds may be used to offset costs incurred by the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages pursuant to court order or settlement agreement.

      (e) Under a GRP conservation easement, the United States will be entitled to recover any and all administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action.

      § 1415.15   Payments not subject to claims.

#### § § 1415.15

      Any cost-share, rental, or easement payment or portion thereof due any person under this part will be allowed without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.

      § 1415.16   Assignments.

#### § § 1415.16

      (a) Any person entitled to any cash payment under this program may assign the right to receive such cash payments, in whole or in part.

      (b) If a participant that is entitled to a payment dies, is declared legally incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, or is succeeded by another person who renders or completes the required performance, such a participant may be eligible to receive payment in such a manner as USDA determines is fair and reasonable in light of all the circumstances.

      § 1415.17   Cooperative agreements.

#### § § 1415.17

      (a) NRCS may enter into cooperative agreements which establish terms and conditions under which an eligible entity will use funds provided by NRCS to own, write, and enforce a grassland protection easement.

      (b) To be eligible to receive GRP funding, an eligible entity must demonstrate:

      (1) A commitment to long-term conservation of agricultural lands, ranch land, or grassland for grazing and conservation purposes;

      (2) A capability to acquire, manage, and enforce easements;

      (3) Sufficient number of staff dedicated to monitoring and easement stewardship;

      (4) The availability of funds; and

      (5) For nongovernmental organizations, the existence of a dedicated account and funds for the purposes of easement management, monitoring, and enforcement of each easement held by the eligible entity.

      (c) NRCS enters into a cooperative agreement with those eligible entities selected for funding. Once a proposal is selected by the State Conservationist, the eligible entity must work with the appropriate State Conservationist to finalize and sign the cooperative agreement, incorporating all necessary GRP requirements. The cooperative agreement addresses:

      (1) The interests in land to be acquired, including the form of the easement deeds to be used and terms and conditions;

      (2) The management and enforcement of the interests acquired;

      (3) The responsibilities of NRCS;

      (4) The responsibilities of the eligible entity on lands acquired with the assistance of GRP;

      (5) The parcels accepted by the State Conservationist, landowners' names, addresses, location map(s), and other relevant information in an a attachment to the cooperative agreement;

      (6) The allowance of parcel substitution upon mutual agreement of the parties;

      (7) The manner in which violations are addressed;

      (15) The eligible entity's succession plan, which describes how its successors or assigns will hold, manage, and enforce the interests in land acquired in the event that the eligible entity is no longer able to fulfill its obligations under the cooperative agreement entered into with NRCS; and

      (16) Other requirements deemed necessary by NRCS to protect the interests of the United States.

      (d) Easements funded under the cooperative agreement option will be in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent easement, and will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with GRP goals and objectives for the term of the easement.

      (e) The entity may use its own terms and conditions in the conservation easement deed, but a conservation easement deed template used by the eligible entity will be submitted to the Chief within 30 days of the signing of the cooperative agreement. The conservation easement deed templates will be reviewed and approved by the Chief. NRCS reserves the right to require additional specific language or to remove language in the conservation easement deed to protect the interests of the United States.

      (1) In order to protect the public investment, the conveyance document must contain a right of enforcement. NRCS will specify the terms for the right of enforcement clause to read as set forth in the GRP cooperative agreement. This right is a vested property right and cannot be condemned or terminated by State or local government;

      (2) The eligible entity will acquire, hold, manage, and enforce the easement. The eligible entity may have the option to enter into an agreement with governmental or private organizations to carry out easement stewardship responsibilities if approved by NRCS;

      (3) Prior to closing, NRCS must sign an acceptance of the conservation easement, concurring with the terms of the conservation easement and accepting its interest in the conservation easement deed;

      (5) The conservation easement deed must include an indemnification clause requiring the participant (grantor) to indemnify and hold harmless the United States from any liability arising from or related to the property enrolled in GRP.

      § 1415.18   Easement transfer to eligible entities.

#### § § 1415.18

      (a) NRCS may transfer title of ownership to an easement to an eligible entity to hold and enforce an easement if:

      (1) The Chief determines that transfer will promote protection of grassland, land that contains forbs, or shrubland;

      (2) The owner authorizes the eligible entity to hold and enforce the easement; and

      (3) The eligible entity agrees to assume the costs incurred in administering and enforcing the easement, including the costs of restoration or rehabilitation of the land as specified by the owner and the eligible entity, and the entity assumes responsibility for enforcing the GRP management plan or conservation plan, as applicable, as approved by NRCS.

      (b) NRCS has the right to conduct periodic inspections to verify the eligible entities enforcement of the easement, which includes the terms and requirements set forth in the GRP management plan and any associated restoration or conservation plan for any easements transferred pursuant to this section.

      (c) An eligible entity that seeks to hold and enforce an easement will apply to the NRCS State Conservationist for approval.

      (d) The Chief may approve an application if the eligible entity:

      (1) Has relevant experience necessary, as appropriate for the application, to administer an easement on grassland, land that contains forbs, or shrublands;

      (2) Has a charter that describes the commitment of the eligible entity to conserving ranch land, agricultural land, or grassland for grazing and conservation purposes;

      Subpart A—General Provisions for Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs

        § 1416.1   Applicability.

#### § § 1416.1

        (a) This subpart establishes general conditions for this subpart and subparts B through E of this part and applies only to those subparts. Subparts B through E cover the following programs authorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-79, also referred to as the 2014 Farm Bill):

        (1) Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP);

        (2) Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP);

        (3) Livestock Indemnity Payments Program (LIP); and

        (4) Tree Assistance Program (TAP).

        (b) To be eligible for payments under these programs, participants must comply with all provisions under this subpart and the relevant particular subpart for that program. All other provisions of law also apply.

        § 1416.2   Administration of ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP.

#### § § 1416.2

        (a) The programs in subparts B through E of this part is administered under the general supervision and direction of the Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA) (who also serves as the Executive Vice-President, CCC), and the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA (referred to as the “Deputy Administrator” in this part).

        (b) FSA representatives do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this part as amended or supplemented, except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (c) The State FSA committee will take any action required by the regulations of this part that the county FSA committee has not taken. The State FSA committee will also:

        (1) Correct, or require a county FSA committee to correct, any action taken by such county FSA committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part or

        (2) Require a county FSA committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

        (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county FSA committee will preclude the FSA Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or a designee or other such person, from determining any question arising under the programs of this part, or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county FSA committee.

        (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county FSA committees to waive or modify non-statutory deadlines, or other program requirements of this part in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements does not adversely affect operation of the programs in this part. Participants have no right to an exception under this provision. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider cases or circumstances or decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this provision will not be considered an adverse decision and is not appealable.

        (f) Payments issued under this part are subject to the availability of funds under Federal law. Within whatever funding limitation that may exist under law, the only funds that will be considered available to pay eligible losses will be that amount approved by the Secretary. If funds are limited, for a particular program year, payments may be delayed until the time for applying for the payment for that program year has passed. In the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the Secretary, approval of eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate the available funds by a national factor to reduce the total expected payments to the amount made available by the Secretary. FSA will make payments based on the factor for the national rate determined by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments in such manner as it determines necessary and appropriate and reasonable. Applications for payment that are unpaid or prorated for a program year for any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds for later years or otherwise, but will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.

#### § § 1416.103

        (a) An eligible loss covered under this subpart is a loss that an eligible producer, livestock owner, or contract grower of livestock, or eligible producer of honeybees or farm-raised fish incurs due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.  All other causes of loss are not considered an eligible loss condition, including, but not limited to, negligence, mismanagement or wrongdoing by the producer.

        (b) A loss covered under LFP or LIP is not eligible for ELAP.

        (c) To be an eligible loss in a program year, the loss must have been apparent to the person or legal entity providing the notice and to FSA in the program year for which payment is being requested.

        (d) For a livestock feed loss to be considered an eligible loss, the livestock feed loss must be one of the following:

        (1) Loss of purchased forage or feedstuffs that was intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(a) that was physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred on the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition. The loss must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storms, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, or wildfire on non-Federal land;

        (2) Loss of mechanically harvested forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(a) that was physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred on the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition. The loss must have occurred after harvest due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storms, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, or wildfire on non-Federal land;

        (3) A loss resulting from the additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed, above normal quantities, required to maintain the eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(a) during an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, until additional livestock feed becomes available, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. To be eligible, the additional feed purchased above normal quantities must be feed that is fed to maintain livestock in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. Eligible adverse weather or eligible loss conditions, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storms, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, or wildfire on non-Federal land;

        (4) A loss resulting from the additional cost incurred for transporting livestock feed to eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(a) due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, costs associated with equipment rental fees for hay lifts and snow removal. To be eligible, the loss must be incurred in combination with a loss described in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. The additional costs incurred must have been incurred for losses suffered in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. Eligible adverse weather or eligible loss conditions, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, include, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storms, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, or wildfire on non-Federal land;

        (5) A loss resulting from the additional cost of transporting water to eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(a) due to eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, costs associated with water transport equipment rental fees, labor, and contracted water transportation fees. The cost of the water is not eligible for payment. To be eligible for additional cost of transporting water to eligible livestock, the livestock must be livestock that would normally have been grazing on eligible grazing lands that meet all of the following:

        (i) Physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, occurred;

        (ii) That had adequate livestock watering systems or facilities before the eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought occurred; and

        (iii) That the producer is not normally required to transport water to the livestock.

        (6) A loss resulting from the additional cost incurred on or after January 1, 2021, to transport eligible livestock to feed or livestock feed to eligible livestock for additional mileage above normal, due to eligible adverse weather, an eligible loss condition, or eligible drought, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including costs associated with treating livestock feed to prevent the spread of invasive pests. The cost of the feed is not eligible for payment. Negligence, mismanagement, or wrongdoing by the producer is not considered an eligible loss condition for livestock or feed transportation costs. To be eligible for a loss under this paragraph (d)(6), the livestock must be livestock that would normally have been on eligible grazing lands physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, occurred. The eligible loss from the additional cost to transport livestock feed is limited to the cost to transport feed to meet the feed needs of eligible livestock for the program year in which the eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought occurred. The cost to transport livestock feed is not an eligible loss if the feed is purchased or obtained:

        (i) In excess of the amount needed for the program year in which eligible adverse weather, eligible loss condition, or eligible drought occurred, as determined according to § 1416.110(q);

        (ii) To sell to another producer;

        (iii) For another producer's livestock; or

        (iv) For ineligible livestock.

        (e) For a grazing loss to be considered eligible, the grazing loss must have been incurred:

        (1) During the normal grazing period, as specified in § 1416.102;

        (2) On eligible grazing land that is physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred;

        (3) Due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storm, flood, hurricane, hail, lightning, tidal surge, volcanic eruption, and wildfire on non-Federal land.

        (f) For a loss resulting from the additional cost associated with gathering livestock to inspect or treat for cattle tick fever, the livestock gathered for inspection or treatment for cattle tick fever must be considered eligible livestock as specified in § 1416.104(d). To be considered an eligible loss, acceptable records, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, must be on file with APHIS, that provide the number of livestock gathered and inspected or treated for cattle tick fever and the number of treatments given during the program year.

        (g) For honeybee feed or farm-raised fish feed losses to be considered an eligible loss, the honeybee feed or farm-raised fish feed loss must be one of the following:

        (1) Loss of honeybee feed or farm-raised fish feed that was intended as feed for the participant's eligible honeybees or farm-raised fish that was physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred on the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition. The loss must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, earthquake, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, and wildfire.

        (2) A loss resulting from the additional cost of purchasing additional honeybee feed, above normal quantities, required to maintain the honeybees during an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, until additional honeybee feed becomes available, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. To be eligible the additional feed purchased above normal quantities must be feed that is fed to maintain honeybees in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. The loss must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, earthquake, early fall frost, excessive rainfall, flood, hurricane, late spring frost, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, wildfire and eligible drought, as specified in § 1416.102.

        (h) For honeybee colony or honeybee hive losses to be considered eligible, the hive producer must have incurred the loss in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. The honeybee colony or hive losses must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, colony collapse disorder, earthquake, eligible winter storm, as specified in § 1416.102, excessive wind, flood, hurricane, lightning, tornado, volcanic eruption, and wildfire. Drought is not an eligible adverse weather event or eligible loss condition for honeybee hive losses. To be considered eligible for honeybee hive loss as of the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather event or eligible loss condition the honeybee hive must be all the following: Maintained for producing honey, pollinating, or breeding honeybees for commercial use in a farming operation; physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss conditions occurred; and be a part of a honeybee farming operation in which the applicant has a risk in honey production, pollination, or honeybee breeding. To be considered an eligible honeybee colony loss, the colony loss must be in excess of normal mortality, as established by the Deputy Administrator, and the loss could not have been prevented through reasonable and available measures. The notice of loss must be accompanied by acceptable documentation, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, that demonstrates an eligible loss occurred and was associated with an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, and that generally accepted husbandry and production practices had been followed. For colony collapse disorder, acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, proof of beginning inventory and good management practices, and a producer certification that the loss of honeybee colonies was a direct result of at least 3 of the following 5 symptoms:

        (1) The loss of live queen or drone bee populations inside the hives;

        (2) Rapid decline of adult worker bee population outside the hives, leaving brood poorly or completely unattended;

        (3) Absence of dead adult bees inside the hive and outside the entrance of the hive;

        (4) Absence of robbing collapsed colonies;

        (5) At the time of collapse, varroa mite and Nosema populations are not at levels known to cause economic injury or population decline.

        (i) For death losses of bait fish, game fish, or other aquatic species, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, to be considered eligible, the producer must have incurred the fish loss, in excess of normal mortality, in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. The fish death must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition as determined by the Deputy Administrator including, but not limited to, earthquake, flood, hurricane, tidal surge, tornado, and volcanic eruption.

        (j) For milk losses due to H5N1 to be considered eligible, the producer must have had reduced milk production as a result of removal of adult dairy cows from daily milking due to H5N1 infection. Such infection must be confirmed for the herd by at least one positive H5N1 test for a dairy cow within that herd. The date of the eligible loss condition for milk losses due to H5N1 is the positive H5N1 test collection date.

        (3) The number of animal units the eligible livestock producer's grazing land or pastureland can sustain during the normal grazing period in the county for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, in the absence of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, determined by dividing the:

        (i) Number of eligible grazing land or pastureland acres of the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, by

        (ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; and

        (4) The number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 150 calendar days during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land.

        (l) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for grazing losses due to a wildfire on non-Federal land will be calculated based on the applicable national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by:

        (1) The result of dividing:

        (i) The number of acres of grazing land or pastureland acres affected by the fire, by

        (ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; times

        (2) The daily value of grazing as calculated by FSA under this section; times

        (3) The number of days grazing was lost due to fire, not to exceed 180 calendar days;

        (m) If a participant, during the normal grazing period for the eligible grazing land, claims both an eligible loss resulting from the additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed above normal quantities, as calculated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and an eligible grazing loss, as calculated in paragraphs (g) or (l) of this section, then the participant may receive no more than the larger of the value of the loss resulting from the:

        (2) Grazing loss, as determined in:

        (i) Paragraph (g) of this section, for losses due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, except wildfires on non-Federal lands, or

        (ii) Paragraph (l) of this section, for losses due to wildfires on non-Federal lands.

        (n) Payments for losses resulting from the additional cost of transporting eligible livestock to feed or livestock feed to eligible livestock, for additional mileage above normal, in excess of 25 miles per truckload and for no more than 1,000 miles per truckload of livestock or livestock feed during the program year, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(6) will be calculated based on a national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by:

        (1) The national average price per mile to transport a truckload of livestock or livestock feed; and

        (2) The actual number of additional miles above normal to transport livestock or livestock feed by an eligible producer, in excess of 25 miles per truckload of livestock or feed and for no more than 1,000 miles per truckload of livestock or feed during the program year.

        (o) The national average price per mile to transport a truckload of livestock or feed to be used in the calculation for paragraph (n)(1) of this section is determined by the Deputy Administrator for each program year using a national cost formula developed by FSA based on the cost of hauling feed or livestock above normal mileage, not to include the first 25 miles. The national average price per mile considers the average cost for hauling a truckload of forage or livestock from sources 200 miles away. The Deputy Administrator may determine a different price per mile for a particular state, if the Deputy Administrator determines that a different price is necessary due to differences in state hauling costs compared to national average costs. The original physical location of the livestock will determine the applicable state for payment purposes.

        (p) Payments for losses resulting from costs associated with treating livestock feed transported above normal to prevent the spread of invasive pests, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(6), will be calculated based on a national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by the producer's actual cost for controlling invasive pests in livestock feed transported above normal.

        (q) For the purpose of payments under paragraph (n) of this section, losses resulting from the additional cost of transporting livestock feed to eligible livestock are limited to the additional cost of transportation of feed to satisfy the feed needs of the eligible livestock identified on the application during the program year in which the eligible drought or other eligible loss condition occurred. Therefore, FSA will:

        (1) Convert the number of eligible livestock identified on the application to an animal unit basis;

        (2) Multiply the animal units determined in paragraph (q)(1) of this section by 24 pounds of corn or corn equivalent or 39 pounds of hay or forage;

        (3) Multiply the result of paragraph (q)(2) of this section by the number of calendar days in the time period from the beginning date of the eligible drought or other eligible loss condition until the end of the program year; and

        (4) Limit the truckloads used in the calculation to the total pounds calculated in paragraph (q)(3) of this section. Any loads hauled in excess of that amount during the program year are not eligible for assistance.

        (r) Payments calculated in this section are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part.

        § 1416.113   Milk losses due to H5N1.

#### § § 1416.113

        (a) Payments for milk losses due to H5N1 are based on a standard number of days of lost production and the expected production for an eligible adult dairy cow. The payment for milk losses due to H5N1 is equal to the payment rate per head specified in paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the number of eligible adult dairy cows specified in § 1416.109(g), multiplied by the producer's share of milk production from the eligible adult dairy cows, multiplied by the national payment rate specified in § 1416.109(d).

        (b) The payment rate per head varies by month and is equal to the expected milk production loss for an eligible adult dairy cow, as determined by FSA, multiplied by the all-milk price. The applicable payment rate will be determined by the month in which an eligible adult dairy cow was removed from milk production, as reported on the application. To determine the expected milk production loss for an eligible adult dairy cow, FSA will:

        (1) Determine the daily expected production by dividing the total expected production for 28 days of production, as determined by FSA based on a month-specific national production value obtained from NASS data, by 28 days; and

        (2) Calculate the sum of:

        (i) The result of paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by 21 days, and

        (ii) The result of paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by 7 days, multiplied by 50 percent.

        (c) Payments calculated in this section are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part.

The quantity and kind of livestock that died or has been injured and sold at a reduced price as a direct result of an eligible attack must be substantiated by documentation of confirmed kills observed by an acceptable source as specified in paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section.

        (f) For losses resulting from an eligible adverse weather event or eligible disease, if adequate verifiable proof of death or injury documentation is not available, the participant may provide reliable records as proof of death or injury. Reliable records may include contemporaneous producer records, dairy herd improvement records, brand inspection records, vaccination records, dated pictures, and other similar reliable documents as determined by FSA.

        (g) For livestock death losses due to disease, a licensed veterinarian's certification of livestock deaths may be accepted as proof of death, if the livestock are not owned by the licensed veterinarian and reliable beginning inventory data is available, only if the veterinarian provides a written statement containing all of the following:

        (1) Veterinarian's personal observation of the animals and knowledge of how the deaths of the livestock were because of disease caused or exacerbated by an eligible adverse weather event;

        (2) Livestock deaths were not otherwise avoidable and preventable using good animal husbandry and management protocols and practices by the livestock producer; and

        (3) Other information required by FSA to determine the certification acceptable.

        (4) Information furnished by the participant and the veterinarian will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without all required information program benefits will not be approved or provided

        (h) Certification of livestock deaths or injuries by third parties may be accepted if both of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The livestock owner or livestock contract grower, as applicable, certifies in writing:

        (i) That there is no other documentation of death available;

        (ii) The number of livestock, by category identified in this subpart and by FSA were in inventory at the time the eligible adverse weather event occurred;

        (iii) The physical location of the livestock, by category, in inventory when the deaths occurred; and

        (iv) Other details required for FSA to determine the certification acceptable; and

        (2) The third party is an independent source who is not affiliated with the farming operation such as a hired hand and is not a “family member,” defined as a person whom a member in the farming operation or their spouse is related as lineal ancestor, lineal descendant, sibling, spouse, and provides their telephone number, address, and a written statement containing specific details about:

        (i) Their knowledge of the livestock deaths;

        (ii) Their affiliation with the livestock owner;

        (iii) The accuracy of the deaths claimed by the livestock owner or contract grower including, but not limited to, the number and kind or type of the participant's livestock that died because of the eligible adverse weather event; and

        (iv) Other information required by FSA to determine the certification acceptable.

        (v) Data furnished by the participant and the third party will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data program benefits will not be approved or provided.

        (i) Unweaned livestock operations may provide proof of death by using the LBIH.

        (1) Livestock inventory reports by livestock unit must be provided to the FSA local county office by March 1 after the end of the calendar year of the eligible adverse weather event. The STC may approve a waiver of the reporting deadline if a participant has not previously received benefits under this method.

        (i) Livestock inventory reports must provide an accurate account of livestock beginning inventory for the livestock type or kind and must be supported by written  records such as but not limited to: Docking records, sales receipts, shearing records, shipping records, bank records, veterinarian records, IRS records, or other records approved by COC. For purposes of determining beginning livestock inventory, livestock inventory reports may require adjustment by COC, not to exceed normal mortality, for when loss occurs at different points during the growing season (for example, inventories from docking may need little to no adjustment, but sales records at the end of the growing season may require an adjustment to account for a full years of normal mortality).

        (ii) The unweaned livestock operation must certify to the accuracy of the information.

        (2) The unweaned livestock operation is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete livestock beginning inventory to the county FSA office. Livestock beginning inventory records must be provided for all livestock type or kind.

        (i) Records may be requested by the applicable COC or STC, on behalf of FSA. The unweaned livestock operation must provide such records upon request.

        (ii) The COC will explain the procedure for the LBIH to unweaned livestock operation. COC will determine the LBIH in accordance with § 1416.305(g).

        (iii) COC will determine if the livestock beginning inventory records are acceptable and calculate the approved livestock beginning inventory history.

        (3) The LBIH is calculated utilizing a minimum of 4 years of data and will be updated each subsequent inventory year. The transitional LBIH may contain a maximum of the 4 most recent calendar years and may include actual and transitional livestock beginning inventories. Transitional LBIH will only be used when less than 4 years of actual records are available. Appropriate adjustments to LBIH may be made to account for variations in ewe, cow and nanny stocking levels during the period covered by the history.

        (4) The unweaned livestock operation is required to provide beginning livestock inventory records to determine the LBIH, if livestock beginning inventory records are available.

        (i) If no acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are available for calves, lambs, or kids, calculate the 4 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the unweaned livestock operation times the applicable cow, ewe, or nanny LBIH times 65 percent.

        (ii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only one of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 3 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the unweaned livestock operation times the applicable cow, ewe, or nanny LBIH times 80 percent.

        (iii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 2 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 2 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the unweaned livestock operation times the applicable cow, ewe, or nanny LBIH times 90 percent.

        (iv) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 3 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the one transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the unweaned livestock operation times the applicable cow, ewe, or nanny LBIH times 100 percent.

        (v) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory history records containing information for 4 or more of the most recent calendar years are provided, calculate the livestock beginning inventory history by taking a simple average of the actual livestock beginning inventory histories.

        (j) When an eligible owner claims eligible livestock were injured by an eligible loss condition and were sold for a reduced price, the owner must provide verifiable evidence of the gross sale price of the livestock. The injured livestock must be sold through an independent third party (sale barn, slaughter facility, or rendering facility). Only verifiable proof of sale with price is acceptable. The gross sale price of the livestock is the amount received for the injured livestock before any reductions, such as sale yard fees. The owner must provide verifiable evidence of livestock sold at a reduced price. Documents that may satisfy this requirement include but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following: Sales receipt from a livestock auction, sale barn, or other similar livestock sales facility; bona-fide commercial sales receipts; private insurance documents; and processing plant receipts.

        § 1416.306   Payment calculation.

#### § § 1416.306

        (a) Under this subpart, separate payment rates for eligible livestock owners and eligible livestock contract growers are specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Payments for death losses are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category by the number of eligible livestock in excess of normal mortality in each category that died as a result of an eligible loss condition. Normal mortality for each livestock category will be determined by FSA on a State-by-State basis using local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State. Adjustments will be applied as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock owners is based on 75 percent of the average fair market value of the applicable livestock as computed using nationwide prices for the previous calendar year unless some other price is approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (c) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock contract growers is based on 75 percent of the average income loss sustained by the contract grower with respect to the dead livestock. The rate that applies is based on the type, class, and weight of the animal at the time of the eligible loss condition and death.

        (d) The LIP payment calculated for eligible livestock contract growers will be reduced by the amount the participant received from the party who contracted with the producer to raise the livestock for the loss of income from the dead livestock.

        (e) Payments to livestock owners for losses due to sale of livestock at a reduced price because of injury from an eligible loss condition are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category by the number of eligible livestock sold at a reduced price as a result of an eligible loss condition, minus the gross amount the eligible livestock owner received for the livestock up to the applicable national payment rate. In the event livestock sells for a reduced price that is in excess of the national payment rate, the national payment rate will be subtracted resulting in no payment for that livestock.

        § 1416.401   Administration.

#### § § 1416.401

        The program will be administered as specified in § 1416.2 and in this subpart.

        § 1416.402   Definitions.

#### § § 1416.402

        The following definitions apply to this subpart. The definitions in parts 718 of this title and 1400 of this chapter also apply, except where they conflict with the definitions in this section.

        means, a low, branching, woody plant, from which at maturity of the bush, an annual fruit or vegetable crop is produced for commercial purposes, such as a blueberry bush. The definition does not cover plants that produce a bush after the normal crop is harvested such as asparagus.

        means used in the operation of a business activity engaged in as a means of livelihood for profit by the eligible producer.

        means an eligible tree, bush, or vine, though damaged, that can rejuvenate and return to an acceptable level of commercial production at some time with rehabilitation and without replanting. A commercially viable tree, bush, or vine, regardless of the extent of damage or years of reduced production, is always excluded and never included as part of mortality under § 1416.403.

        means the FSA or U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Service Center that is responsible for servicing the farm on which the trees, bushes, or vines are located.

        means a piece of a vine which was planted in the ground to propagate a new vine for the commercial production of fruit, such as grapes, kiwi fruit, passion fruit, or similar fruit.

        means a person or legal entity that produces nursery, ornamental, fruit, nut, or Christmas trees for commercial sale.

        means a person or legal entity that produces annual crops from trees, bushes, or vines for commercial purposes.

        means the Farm Service Agency.

        means, with respect to the extent of damage to a tree or other plant, that the plant is destroyed or the damage is such that it would, as determined by FSA, be more cost effective to replace the tree or other plant than to leave it in its deteriorated, low-producing state.

        means plant disease, insect infestation, drought, fire, freeze, flood, earthquake, lightning, or other natural occurrence. Each of these types of disasters must be extreme, abnormal, and damaging as well as of significant magnitude or severity, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        means the percentage, as established for the area by the FSA State Committee, of trees, bushes, or vines in the stand that would normally be damaged during a calendar year for a producer.

        means percentage, as established for the area by the FSA State Committee, of expected lost trees, bushes, or vines in the stand that normally occurs during a calendar year for a producer. This term refers to the number of whole trees, bushes, or vines that are destroyed or damaged beyond rehabilitation. Mortality does not include partial damage such as lost tree limbs.

        means an immature tree, bush, or vine that was planted in the ground or other growing medium to grow a new tree, bush, or vine for commercial purposes.

        means a contiguous acreage of the same type of trees (including Christmas trees, ornamental trees, nursery trees, and potted trees), bushes (including shrubs), or vines.

        means a tall, woody plant having comparatively great height, and a single trunk from which an annual crop is produced for commercial purposes, such as a maple tree for syrup, papaya tree, or orchard tree. _Tree_s used for pulp or timber are not considered eligible trees under this subpart.

        means a perennial plant grown under normal conditions from which an annual fruit crop is produced for commercial market for human consumption, such as grape, kiwi, or passion fruit, and that has a flexible stem supported by climbing, twining, or creeping along a surface. Perennials that are normally propagated as annuals such as tomato plants, biennials such as the plants that produce strawberries, and annuals such as pumpkins, squash, cucumbers, watermelon, and other melons, are excluded from the term vine in this subpart.

        § 1416.403   Eligible losses.

#### § § 1416.403

        (a) To qualify for any assistance under this subpart, except for assistance under § 1416.400(c), the eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower must first have suffered more than a 15 percent tree, bush, or vine mortality loss on a stand (adjusted for normal mortality) as a result of natural disaster as determined by the Deputy Administrator. For assistance for losses to pecan trees under § 1416.400(c), the eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower must first have suffered a mortality loss of more than 7.5 percent (adjusted for normal mortality) on a stand as a result of natural disaster as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (b) The qualifying loss of a stand of trees, bushes, or vines specified in paragraph (a) of this section will be determined based on:

        (1) Each eligible disaster event, except for losses due to plant disease;

        (2) For plant disease, the time period, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, for which the stand is infected.

        (c) Mortality or damage loss not eligible for inclusion as a qualifying loss under this section or for payment under § 1416.406 includes those losses where:

        (1) The loss or damage could have been prevented through reasonable and available measures; and

        (2) The trees, bushes, or vines, in the absence of a natural disaster, would normally have required rehabilitation or replanting within the 12-month period following the loss.

        (d) The damage or loss must be visible and obvious to the county committee representative. If the damage is no longer visible, the county committee may accept other evidence of the loss as it determines is reasonable.

        (e) The county committee may require information from a qualified expert, as determined by the county committee, to determine extent of loss in the case of plant disease or insect infestation.

        (f) The Deputy Administrator will determine the types of trees, bushes, and vines that are eligible.

        (g) A stand that did not suffer a qualifying mortality loss as specified in paragraph (a) of this section is not eligible for payment. The qualifying mortality loss will be determined based on the eligible trees, bushes, or vines that reached mortality, which means that the tree, bush, or vine died, above and below ground, as a result of an eligible natural disaster event. If an eligible tree, bush, or vine is damaged to such an extent that it is not commercially viable, now or at any time in the future, the tree, bush, or vine can be considered dead in determining if the requisite qualifying mortality loss threshold in paragraph (a) of this section is reached.

        § 1416.404   Eligible orchardists and nursery tree growers.

#### § § 1416.404

        (a) Once the requisite qualifying eligible mortality loss is determined according to § 1416.403, to be eligible for TAP payments, the eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower must:

        (1) Have planted, or be considered to have planted (by purchase prior to the loss of existing stock planted for commercial purposes) trees, bushes, or vines for commercial purposes, or have a production history, for commercial purposes, of planted or existing trees, bushes, or vines;

        (2) Have suffered eligible losses of eligible trees, bushes, or vines, as a result of a natural disaster or related condition;

        (3) Have continuously owned the stand from the time of the disaster until the time that the TAP application is submitted.

        (b) A new owner of an orchard or nursery who does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may receive TAP payments approved for the previous owner of the orchard or nursery and not paid to the previous owner, if the previous owner of the orchard or nursery agrees to the succession in writing and if the new owner:

        (1) Acquires ownership of trees, bushes, or vines for which benefits have been approved;

        (2) Agrees to complete all approved practices that the original owner has not completed; and

        (3) Otherwise meets and assumes full responsibility for all provisions of this part, including refund of payments made to the previous owner, if applicable.

        (c) A producer seeking payment must not be ineligible under the restrictions applicable to citizenship and foreign corporations contained in § 1416.3(b) and must meet all other requirements of subpart A of this part.

        (d) Federal, State, and local governments and agencies and political subdivisions thereof are not eligible for payment under this subpart.

        § 1416.405   Application.

#### § § 1416.405

        (a) To apply for TAP, a producer that suffered eligible tree, bush, or vine losses must provide an application for payment and supporting  documentation to FSA or within 90 calendar days of the disaster event or date when the loss of trees, bushes, or vines is apparent to the producer.

        (b) The producer must submit the application for payment within the time specified in paragraph (a) of this section to the FSA administrative county office that maintains the producer's farm records for the agricultural operation.

        (c) A complete application includes all of the following:

        (1) A completed application form provided by FSA;

        (2) An acreage report for the farming operation as specified in part 718, subpart B, of this title;

        (3) Subject to verification and a loss amount determined appropriate by the county committee, a written estimate of the number of trees, bushes, or vines lost or damaged that is certified by the producer or a qualified expert, including the number of acres on which the loss occurred;

        (4) Sufficient evidence of the loss to allow the county committee to calculate whether an eligible loss occurred; and

        (5) A farm operating plan, if a current farm operating plan is not already on file in the FSA county office.

        (d) Before requests for payment will be approved, the county committee:

        (1) Must make an eligibility determination based on a complete application for assistance;

        (2) Must verify actual qualifying losses and the number of acres involved by on-site visual inspection of the land and the trees, bushes, or vines;

        (3) May request additional information and may consider all relevant information in making its determination; and

        (4) Must verify actual costs to complete the practices, as documented by the producer.

        § 1416.406   Payment calculations.

#### § § 1416.406

        (a) Once the loss threshold in § 1416.403(a) is satisfied, payment to an eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower for the cost of replanting or rehabilitating trees, bushes, or vines damaged or lost due to a natural disaster, in excess of 15 percent damage or mortality (adjusted for normal damage or mortality), will be calculated as follows:

        (1) For the cost of planting seedlings or cuttings, to replace lost trees, bushes, or vines, the lesser of:

        (i) 65 percent of the actual cost of the practice for eligible producers, or 75 percent of the actual cost of the practice for an eligible producer who is a beginning or veteran farmer or rancher, or

        (ii) The amount calculated using rates established by the Deputy Administrator for the practice.

        (2) For the cost of pruning, removal, and other costs incurred for salvaging damaged trees, bushes, or vines, or in the case of mortality, to prepare the land to replant trees, bushes, or vines, the lesser of:

        (i) 50 percent of the actual cost of the practice for eligible producers, or 75 percent of the actual cost of the practice for an eligible producer who is a beginning or veteran farmer or rancher, or

        (ii) The amount calculated using rates established by the Deputy Administrator for the practice.

        (b) An orchardist or nursery tree grower that did not plant the trees, bushes, or vines, but has a production history for commercial purposes on planted or existing trees and lost the trees, bushes, or vines as a result of a natural disaster, in excess of 15 percent mortality (adjusted for normal mortality), will be eligible for the salvage, pruning, and land preparation payment calculation as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. To be eligible for the replanting payment calculation as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the orchardist or nursery grower who did not plant the stock must be a new owner who meets all of the requirements of § 1416.404(b) or be considered the owner of the trees under provisions appearing elsewhere in this subpart.

        (c) Eligible costs for payment calculation include costs for:

        (1) Seedlings or cuttings, for tree, bush, or vine replanting;

        (2) Site preparation and debris handling within normal horticultural practices for the type of stand being re-established, and necessary to ensure successful plant survival;

        (3) Pruning, removal, and other costs incurred to salvage damaged trees, bushes, or vines, or, in the case of tree mortality, to prepare the land to replant trees, bushes, or vines;

        (4) Chemicals and nutrients necessary for successful establishment;

        (5) Labor to plant seedlings or cuttings as determined reasonable by the county committee; and

        (6) Labor used to transplant existing seedlings established through natural regeneration into a productive tree stand.

        (d) The following costs are not eligible:

        (1) Costs for fencing, irrigation, irrigation equipment, protection of seedlings from wildlife, general improvements, re-establishing structures, and windscreens.

        (2) Any other costs not listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section, unless specifically determined eligible by the Deputy Administrator.

        (3) Costs or expenses that the eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower did not actually bear or incur because someone or some other entity bore or incurred those costs or expenses, or the costs were reimbursed under another program. For example, if under any other program the expenses are paid for on behalf of the eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower, those expenses are not eligible for cost share under this subpart.

        (e) Producers must provide the county committee documentation of actual costs to complete the practices, such as receipts for labor costs, equipment rental, and purchases of seedlings or cuttings.

        (f) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be different from those originally planted. The alternative types will be eligible for payment if the new types have the same general end use, as determined and approved by the county committee. Payments for alternative types will be based on the lesser of rates established to plant the types actually lost or the cost to establish the alternative used. If the type of plantings, seedlings, or cuttings differs significantly from the types lost, the costs may not be approved for payment.

        (g) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be planted on the same farm in a different location than the lost stand. To be eligible for payment, site preparation costs for the new location must not exceed the cost to re-establish the original stand in the original location.

        (h) Eligible orchardists or nursery tree growers may elect not to replant the entire stand. If so, the county committee will calculate payment based on the number of qualifying trees, bushes, or vines actually replanted.

        (i) If a practice, such as site preparation, is needed to both replant and rehabilitate trees, bushes, or vines, the producer must document the expenses attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation. The county committee will determine whether the documentation of expenses detailing the amounts attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation is acceptable. In the event that the county committee determines the documentation does not include acceptable detail of cost allocation, the county committee will pro-rate payment based on physical inspection of the loss, damage, replanting, and rehabilitation.

        (j) The cumulative total quantity of acres planted to trees, bushes, or vines for which a producer may receive payment under this part for losses that cannot exceed 1,000 acres per program year.

        (c)(1) To be an eligible commodity, the commodity must be merchantable for food, feed, or other uses determined by CCC and must not contain mercurial compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous to humans or animals. A commodity containing vomitoxin, aflatoxin, or Aspergillus mold may not be pledged for a nonrecourse MAL made under this part, except as provided by CCC in the MAL note and security agreement.

        (2) The determination of eligibility for rice includes class, grade, grading factor, milling yields, and other quality factors and will be based upon the U.S. Standards for Rice as applied to rough rice whether or not such determinations are made on the basis of an official inspection.

        § 1421.6   Beneficial interest.

#### § § 1421.6

        (a) To be eligible to receive MALs and loan deficiency payments, a producer must have beneficial interest in the commodity that is tendered to CCC for a MAL or is requested for a LDP. For the purposes of this part, the term “beneficial interest” refers to a determination by CCC that a person has title to and control of the commodity that is tendered to CCC as collateral for a MAL or of the commodity that will be used to determine a LDP. A determination of whether a person has beneficial interest in a commodity is made by CCC in accordance with this part and is not based upon a determination under any State law or any other regulation of a Federal agency.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, when requesting a MAL for a loan commodity, in order to have beneficial interest in the commodity tendered as collateral for the MAL, a person must:

        (1) Be the producer of the commodity as determined in accordance with § 1421.4;

        (2) Have had ownership of the commodity from the time it was planted (with respect to wool and mohair from time of shearing) through the earlier the date the MAL was repaid or the maturity date of the MAL;

        (3) Have control of the commodity from the time of planting (for wool and mohair from the time of shearing) through the maturity date of the MAL. To have control of the commodity, such person must have complete decision-making authority regarding whether the commodity will be tendered as collateral for a MAL, when the MAL will be repaid, or if the collateral will be forfeited to CCC in satisfaction of the MAL obligations of such person, and where the commodity will be maintained during the term of the MAL;

        (4) Not have received any payment from any party with respect to the commodity; and

        (5) If the commodity has been physically delivered to a location other than a location owned or under the total control of the producer, have delivered the commodity to a warehouse authorized in accordance with § 1421.103(c). Delivery of the commodity to a location other than to such an authorized warehouse will result in the loss of beneficial interest in the commodity on the date of physical delivery and the producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest as of 11:59 p.m. of such day. Accordingly, delivery of a commodity to entities such as a dairy, feedlot, ethanol plant, wool pool, feed mill, feed or grain bank, or other facilities as determined by CCC will result in the loss of beneficial interest as of the date of delivery, regardless of any other action or agreement between such an entity and the producer unless such an entity has been authorized by CCC under § 1421.103(c).

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, when requesting a loan deficiency payment for an eligible commodity, in order to have beneficial interest in the commodity a person must:

        (1) Be the producer of the commodity as determined in accordance with § 1421.4;

        (2) Have had ownership of the commodity from the time it was planted, with respect to wool and mohair from the time of shearing, or from the time of slaughter for unshorn pelts, through the date the producer has elected to determine the loan deficiency payment rate;

        (3) Have control of the commodity. For control such person must have complete decisionmaking authority regarding whether a loan deficiency payment will be requested with respect to the commodity; when the loan deficiency rate will be selected; and where the commodity will be maintained prior to the date on which the LDP rate will be determined;

        (4) Not have received any payment from any party with respect to the commodity; and

        (5) If the commodity has been physically delivered to a location other than a location owned or under the total control of the producer, have delivered the commodity to a warehouse authorized in accordance with § 1421.103(c). Delivery of the commodity to a location other than to an authorized warehouse will result in the loss of beneficial interest in the commodity on the date of physical delivery and the producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest as of 11:59 p.m. of such day. Accordingly, delivery of a commodity to entities such as a dairy, feedlot, ethanol plant, wool pool, feed mill, feed or grain bank, or unauthorized storage facility, will result in the loss of beneficial interest as of the date of delivery, regardless of any other action or agreement between such an entity and the producer unless such an entity has been authorized by CCC under § 1421.103(c).

        (d) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 1421.5(f), in order to facilitate handling situations involving the death of a producer, CCC will consider an estate, heirs of the deceased producer, and a person to whom title to a commodity has passed by virtue of State law upon the death of the producer to have beneficial interest in a commodity produced by the producer under the same terms and conditions that would otherwise be applicable to such producer;

        (e) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 1421.5(f), a person who purchases or otherwise acquires a commodity from a producer under any circumstances does not obtain beneficial interest to the commodity whether such purchase or acquisition is made prior to the harvest of the crop or after harvest; however, CCC will consider a person to have beneficial interest in a commodity if, prior to harvest, such person has obtained title to the growing commodity at the same time that such person obtained full title to the land on which such crop was growing;

        (f) If marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments are made available to producers through an approved CMA in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter, the beneficial interest in the commodity must always have been in the producer-member who delivered the commodity to the approved CMA or its member approved CMA, except as otherwise provided in this section. If the producer-member who delivered the commodity does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the commodity as provided in part 1425 of this chapter, commodities delivered to an approved CMA shall not be eligible to be pledged as collateral for a marketing assistance loan or be taken into consideration when a loan deficiency payment is made.

        (g) A producer will lose beneficial interest in a commodity if the producer receives any payment from any person under any contractual arrangement with respect to a commodity if the person who is making the payment, or any person otherwise associated with the person making the payment, will at any time have title to the commodity or control of the commodity prior to or after harvest, shearing, or slaughter unless:

        (1) Such payment is authorized in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter; or

        (2) The payment is made as consideration for an option to purchase the commodity and such option contains the following language:

        

        

        

        

        (h) Inclusion in a contract of one or more of the following types of provisions will not result in the loss of beneficial interest in a commodity:

        (1) A provision that allows the producer to select the sales price of the commodity at a time the contract is entered into or at a later date, for example, a contract normally referred to as a deferred-price, forward or price later contract. The following conditions apply:

        (i) Producers under a deferred-price, forward, or price later contract will lose beneficial interest in the commodity the earlier of receipt of any payment or once the commodity is applied in fulfillment of the delivery requirements of such a contract.

        (ii) Beneficial interest in the commodity is retained by the producer if the contract has no restrictive or contradictory clauses within the contract that may cause the producer to lose beneficial interest in the commodity.

        (2) A provision between the producer and a warehouse authorized in accordance with § 1421.103(c) for the storage of MAL collateral that provides the producer a period of time following the date of physical delivery of the commodity to elect whether the commodity is to be stored and receipted on behalf of the producer or is to be considered transferred to the warehouse if CCC determines such a provision is required.

        (i) Commodities produced under a contract in which the title to the seed remains with the entity providing the seed to the producer, including contracts for the production of hybrid seed, genetically modified commodities, and other specialty seeds as approved in writing by CCC, are eligible to be pledged as collateral for a MAL or a LDP may be made with respect to such production if, at the time of the request for such a MAL or LDP, the producer has not:

        (1) Received a payment under the contract; or

        (2) Delivered the commodity to another person.

#### § § 1421.8

        (a) With respect to MALs and LDPs for:

        (1) Farm-stored commodities, all determinations of weight and quality, except as otherwise agreed to or required by CCC, will be determined at the time of delivery of the commodity to CCC or at the time the LDP application is filed for measured requests, if applicable, or selected for spot-check for certified requests.

        (2) Warehouse-stored commodities, all determinations of grade, weight and quality, except as otherwise agreed to or required by CCC, will be determined at the time the MAL is forfeited to CCC.

        (b)(1) A producer may, before the final MAL availability date for obtaining a MAL for a commodity, repledge as collateral for securing a MAL any commodity that had been previously pledged as collateral for a MAL, except with respect to:

        (i) Commodities that have been redeemed at the prevailing world market price for rice, or the alternative repayment rate for all other commodities, as determined by CCC.

        (ii) Commodities on which a LDP has been received.

        (2) The commodity repledged as security for the subsequent MAL will have the same maturity date, under § 1421.101 as the original MAL.

        (c)(1) The MAL documents will not be presented for disbursement unless the commodity subject to the note and security agreement is an eligible harvested commodity, is in existence, and is in authorized farm or warehouse storage, as determined by CCC. If the commodity was not either an eligible commodity, in existence, or in authorized storage at the time of disbursement, the total amount disbursed under the MAL and charges plus interest must be refunded promptly by the producer.

        (2) CCC will limit the total quantity for MAL or LDP disbursement to 100 percent of the quantity of such MAL or LDP application. A producer may obtain a separate MAL or LDP before the final loan availability date for the commodity for quantities in excess of 100 percent of such quantity if such quantities are otherwise eligible.

        § 1421.9   Basic loan rates.

#### § § 1421.9

        (a) Basic MAL rates for a commodity may be established on a National, State, regional, county basis or other basis, will be at rates that comply with applicable statutes, and may be adjusted by CCC to reflect grade, type, quality, location and other factors applicable to the commodity and as otherwise provided in this section.

        (b) The basic MAL rates for wheat, corn, barley, oats, grain sorghum, rice, peanuts, soybean, canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, sunflower seed, dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, crambe, sesame seed, wool, mohair and other crops designated by CCC will be determined by CCC and made available to State and county offices.

        (c) Subject to adjustment as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, in case of forfeiture, for all commodities except rice and peanuts, warehouse-stored MALs will be disbursed at levels based on the basic county MAL rate for the county where the commodity is stored.

        (1) For rice, subject to adjustment as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, in case of forfeiture, warehouse-stored MALs will be disbursed at levels based on the milling yields times the whole and broken kernel MAL rates.

        (2) For peanuts, warehouse-stored MALs will be disbursed at levels based on National loan rates by peanut type, adjusted for the schedule of premiums and discounts on the basis of grade, quality, and other factors specified on warehouse receipts.

        (d) The Secretary will establish a single loan rate in each county for each kind of other oilseeds, such as but not limited to, sunflower, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe, sesame seed, and other oilseeds as designated by the Secretary.

        (e) Adjustments by the Secretary to establish loan rates for loan commodities, except rice, on a county basis will not be lower than 95 percent of the national average loan rate, if those loan rates do not result in an increase in outlays. Adjustments in this section will not result in an increase in the national average loan rate for any year.

        (f) For all crop years, premiums and discounts will not apply for all eligible loan commodities at loan disbursement, except for peanuts or additional commodities as determined by the Deputy Administrator on a crop year basis. However, premiums and discounts will apply if the eligible loan commodities are forfeited or delivered to CCC and any deficiency must be repaid to CCC.

        § 1421.10   Loan repayment rates.

#### § § 1421.10

        (a) For the applicable crop years of barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, wheat, dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, oilseeds, wool, mohair, and other crops as designated by CCC (other than peanuts, long grain rice, medium grain rice, and confectionery and each other kind of sunflower seed (other than oil sunflower seed)), a producer may repay a nonrecourse MAL at a rate that is the lesser of:

        (2) A rate (as determined by the Secretary) that is calculated based on average market prices for the loan commodity during a preceding 30-day period and that the Secretary has determined will minimize discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county boundaries; or

        (3) A rate that the Secretary may develop using alternative methods for calculating a repayment rate for a loan commodity that the Secretary determines will: Minimize potential loan forfeitures; minimize the accumulation of stocks of the commodity by the Federal Government; minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing the commodity; allow the commodity produced in the U.S. to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally; and minimize discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county boundaries.

        (b) To the extent practicable, CCC will determine and announce repayment rates under paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section based upon market prices at appropriate U.S. markets as determined by CCC and these repayment rates may be adjusted to reflect grade, type, quality, location, and other factors for each crop of a commodity as follows:

        (1) On a weekly basis in each county for oilseeds, except canola, flaxseed, soybeans, and sunflower seed;

        (2) On a daily basis in each county for barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, sunflower seed and wheat; and

        (3) On a weekly basis regionally for dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, wool and mohair.

        (1) A producer may repay a nonrecourse MAL for peanuts at a rate that is the lesser of:

        (i) The loan rate established for the commodity under § 1421.9, plus interest; or

        (ii) A rate that the Secretary determines will: Minimize potential loan forfeitures; minimize the accumulation of stocks of the commodity by the Federal Government; minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing the commodity; and allow the commodity produced in the United States to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally.

        (2) To the extent practicable, CCC will determine and announce weekly alternative repayment rates for peanuts.

        (d) For peanuts, the Secretary will require the repayment of handling and other associated costs paid under § 1421.104 for all peanuts pledged as collateral for a MAL that are redeemed under this section.

        (e) The Secretary will permit producers to repay a MAL for long grain rice and medium grain rice at a rate that is the lesser of:

        (1) The loan rate established for the commodity under § 1421.9, plus interest; or

        (2) The prevailing world market price for the commodity, as determined and adjusted by the Secretary in accordance with this section.

        (f) For purposes of this section, the Secretary will prescribe—

        (1) A formula to determine the prevailing world market price for long grain rice and medium grain rice and

        (2) A mechanism by which the Secretary will announce periodically those prevailing world market prices.

        (g) Adjustments will be made to the prevailing world market price for long grain rice and medium grain rice.

        (1) The prevailing world market price for long grain and medium rice determined under paragraph (f) of this section will be adjusted to U.S. quality and location.

        (2) In making adjustments under this subsection, the Secretary will establish a mechanism for determining and announcing the adjustments in order to avoid undue disruption in the U.S. market.

        (h)(1) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice will be determined by CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through the use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice, tender offers, credit concessions, barter sales, government-to-government sales, special processing costs for coatings or premixes, and other relevant price indicators, and will be expressed in U.S. equivalent values F.O.B. (free on board) vessel, U.S. port of export, per hundredweight as follows:

        (i) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, long grain milled rice;

        (ii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, medium grain milled rice; and

        (iii) U.S. grade No. 2, 4 percent broken kernels, short grain milled rice.

        (2) Export transactions involving rice and all other related market information will be monitored on a continuous basis. Relevant information may be obtained for this purpose from USDA field reports, international organizations, public or private research entities, international rice brokers, and other sources of reliable information.

        (3) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice adjusted to U.S. quality and location, the adjusted world price (AWP), as determined under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, will apply to this section.

        (4) The adjusted world price for each class of rice will equal the prevailing world market price for a class of rice (U.S. equivalent value) as determined under paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section and adjusted to U.S. quality and location as follows:

        (i) The prevailing world market price for a class of rice will be adjusted to reflect an F.O.B. mill position by deducting from such calculated price an amount that is equal to the estimated national average costs associated with:

        (A) The use of bags for the export of U.S. rice, and

        (B) The transfer of such rice from a mill location to F.O.B. vessel at the U.S. port of export with such costs including, but not limited to, freight, unloading, wharfage, insurance, inspection, fumigation, stevedoring, interest, banking charges, storage, and administrative costs.

        (ii) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the market value of the total quantity of whole kernels contained in milled rice by deducting the world value of broken kernels it contains, with the value of the broken kernels determined by multiplying a formulaic quantity of broken kernels (4 percent per hundredweight) by the world market value of broken kernels. The world market value of broken kernels will be based upon the relationship of whole and broken kernel world prices as estimated from observations of prices at which rice is being sold in world markets.

        (iii) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the per-pound market value of whole kernels by dividing the price by the quantity of whole milled kernels contained in the milled rice (96 percent per hundredweight).

        (iv) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the market value of whole kernels contained in 100 pounds of rough rice by multiplying such price by the estimated national average quantity of whole kernel rice by class obtained from milling 100 pounds of rough rice.

        (v) The price determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the total market value of rough rice by:

        (A) Adding to such price:

        () The market value of bran contained in the rough rice, computed by multiplying the domestic unit market value of bran by the estimated national average quantity of bran produced in milling _1_00 pounds of rice; and

        () The market value of broken kernels contained in the rough rice, computed by multiplying the estimated world market value of broken kernels by the estimated national average quantity of broken kernels produced in milling 100 pounds of rice;

        (B) Deducting from such price an estimated cost of milling rough rice; and an estimated cost of transporting rough rice from farm to mill locations.

        (5) The adjusted world price for each class of rice, loan rate basis, will be determined by CCC and announced, to the extent practicable, on or after 7 a.m. Eastern Standard Time each Wednesday or more frequently as determined necessary by CCC, continuing through the later of:

        (i) The last Wednesday of July in the calendar year following the year the rice crop was harvested, or in which the rice MAL matures,

        (ii) The last Wednesday of the latest month the rice MAL matures, or

        (iii) If Tuesday is not a normal business day, the price determination may be made on the next work day and announced the following day, on or after 7 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

        (i) The producer may repay a MAL under this section for confectionery and each other kind of sunflower seed (other than oil sunflower seed) at a rate that is the lesser of:

        (1) The loan rate established for the commodity under § 1421.9, plus interest, or

        (2) The repayment rate established for oil sunflower seed.

        (j)(1) On a form prescribed by CCC, a producer may request to lock in the applicable repayment rate for a period of 60 calendar days or for the remaining life of the MAL term, whichever is less, provided that no request may be granted within 14 calendar days of the end of the MAL.

        (2) The request to lock in the applicable repayment rate must be received in the FSA county service center that disbursed the MAL.

        (3) The repayment rate that is locked in will be the rate in effect when the request to lock in is approved.

        (4) The repayment rate may be locked in on outstanding farm-stored or warehouse-stored loans.

        (5) The repayment rate that is locked in will expire as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

        (6) The requests can only be completed one time for a designated quantity.

        (7) For multiple locked in requests, the oldest unexpired locked in repayment rate is applied first.

        (8) The completed and signed form can be submitted in person, by facsimile, or electronically.

        (9) The requests cannot be canceled, terminated, or changed after approval.

        (10) The locked in applicable repayment rate will transfer to any MAL disbursed outside of the originating county where the commodity was stored.

        (11) Once a repayment rate is locked in it cannot be extended.

        (k) If a producer fails to repay a MAL within the time prescribed by CCC under the terms and conditions of the request to lock in a market loan repayment rate, the producer may repay the MAL:

        (1) On or before maturity, at the lesser of:

        (i) Principal plus interest as determined by CCC; or

        (ii) The repayment rate in effect on the day the repayment is received in the FSA County Service Center.

        (2) After maturity, at principal plus interest.

        (l) When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to repay all or a part of a farm-stored MAL, the producer must request and obtain prior written approval on a CCC-approved form and comply with the terms and conditions of such form, to remove a specified quantity of the commodity from storage. Approval does not constitute release of CCC's security interest in the commodity or release of producer liability for amounts due CCC for the MAL indebtedness if payment in full is not received by the FSA county office. Failure to repay a MAL within the time period prescribed by CCC in the case of a farm-stored loan and delivery of the pledged collateral to a buyer is a violation of the agreement. In the case of such violation, the producer must repay the loan principal and interest or another amount as determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA, as specified in § 1421.109.

        (m) The producer may obtain county committee approval of a release of all or part of pledged collateral for a warehouse-stored MAL at or before the maturity of such MAL by paying to CCC:

        (1) The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and charges plus interest or

        (2) An amount less than the principal amount of the MAL and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the collateral for such MAL.

        (n) A partial release of marketing assistance loan collateral must cover all of the commodity represented by one warehouse receipt. Warehouse receipts redeemed by repayment of the marketing assistance loan must be released only to the producer. However, such receipt may be released to persons designated in a written authorization that is filed with the county office by the producer within 15 days before the date of repayment.

        (o) The note and security agreement will not be released until the marketing assistance loan has been satisfied in full.

        (p)(1) If the commodity is moved from storage without obtaining prior approval to move such commodity, such removal will constitute unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable under § 1421.109(b), unless the removal occurred on a non-workday and the producer notified the county office on the next workday of such removal.

        (2) Any MAL quantities involved in a violation of § 1421.109 must be repaid under § 1421.109(e).

        (q) In the event of a severe disruption to marketing, transportation, or related infrastructure, the Secretary may modify the repayment rate otherwise applicable under this section for marketing assistance loans. Any adjustment made to the repayment rate for marketing assistance loans for a loan commodity under § 1421.5 will be in effect on a short-term and temporary basis, as determined by the Secretary.

        (a) Authorized farm storage is:

        (1) A storage structure located on or off the farm, (excluding public warehouses that do not enter into an agreement with CCC), that CCC determines to be controlled by the producer which affords safe storage of collateral pledged for a MAL;

        (2) If determined and announced to be available in a State or county, on ground storage and other temporary storage structures approved by CCC.

        (3) As determined by CCC, temporary authorized storage may also include:

        (i) On-ground storage or;

        (ii) Other storage arrangements.

        (b) CCC may reduce the quantity of a commodity pledged as collateral for a MAL made available under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to not more than 75 percent of such otherwise eligible quantity in order to protect the interests of CCC. CCC may also limit the length of time the commodity may be stored on-ground or in temporary structures to not more than 90 days. A MAL made with respect to such commodity that is not moved to a structure specified in (a)(2) within 90 days of the date the MAL was disbursed may be called by CCC.

        (c)(1) Authorized warehouse storage consists of warehouses that:

        (i) If Federally licensed, are in compliance with 7 CFR part 735 or

        (ii) If not Federally licensed, are in compliance with State laws and that issue warehouse receipts that meet the criteria specified in § 1421.107.

        (iii) If not Federally licensed or in compliance with State Laws and issue warehouse receipts that meet the criteria specified in § 1421.107, have entered into a storage agreement with CCC.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if storing peanuts, the warehouse must in all cases have entered into a storage agreement with CCC. For storing other crops, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, CCC may, on a case-by-case basis, still require a warehouse operator that would qualify under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to enter into a storage agreement if deemed necessary by the Deputy Administrator to be needed to protect CCC's interests.

        (a)(1) CCC may conduct such lien searches and may perfect its interest in loan commodities under State law as it deems to be in its interest.

        (2) The cost for terminating the financing statement for MALs disbursed under this part before the end of the term will be paid by the producer.

        (3) If there are any liens or encumbrances on the commodity pledged as collateral for a MAL made under this part, waivers that fully protect CCC's interest must be obtained even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from MAL proceeds disbursed under this part. No additional liens or encumbrances will be placed on the commodity after such a MAL is approved.

        (b) Fees, charges, interest, and all applicable approved commodity assessment collections must be paid by the producer at a rate CCC determines or, in the case of assessments, at a rate approved by the assessment authority. Such fees, charges, and interest include:

        (1) A non-refundable loan service fee;

        (2) Interest that accrues on a loan under part 1405 of this chapter.

        (c) To ensure proper storage of peanuts for which a MAL is made under this section, the Secretary will pay reasonable handling and other associated costs (other than storage) incurred at the time at which the peanuts are placed in a warehouse stored MAL. Such rates will be available in the State and county FSA offices.

        § 1421.105   Farm-stored MALs.

#### § § 1421.105

        (a) The producer of a commodity pledged as security for a farm-storage MAL:

        (1) Certifies the quantity of such commodity on the MAL application, or;

        (2) Has such quantity measured by CCC at the measurement service rate established by CCC.

        (b) The State committee may establish a MAL percentage not to exceed a percentage CCC establishes or it may apply quality discounts to the loan rate in each year for each commodity on a statewide basis or for specified areas within the State. Before approving a county committee request to establish a different loan percentage, or to apply quality discounts, the State committee will consider conditions in the State or areas within a State to determine if the MAL percentage should be reduced below the maximum MAL percentage or the quality discounts should be applied to the basic county MAL rate to provide CCC with adequate protection. MALs disbursed based upon loan percentages previously lowered and loan rates adjusted for quality will not be altered if conditions within the State or areas within the State change to substantiate removing such reductions. Percentages established or loan rates adjusted for quality under this section will apply only to new MALs and not to outstanding MALs. In determining loan percentages or the necessity to apply quality discounts, the State committee will consider any factor at its discretion, including the following:

        (1) General crop conditions;

        (2) Factors affecting quality peculiar to an area within the State; and

        (3) Climatic conditions affecting storability.

        (c) An eligible quantity of a commodity that is commingled with an ineligible quantity of the commodity is not eligible to be collateral for a MAL unless the producer, when requesting a MAL designates all structures that may be used for storage of the MAL collateral.

        (1) In such cases, the producer is not required to obtain prior written approval from the county committee before moving MAL collateral from one designated structure to another designated structure.

        (2) In all other instances, if the producer intends to move MAL collateral from a designated structure to an undesignated structure, the producer must request prior approval from the county committee in writing. The producer may request that the eligible or ineligible commodity be measured by a representative of the county office, at the producer's expense, before commingling, but such measurement is not required. Prior to commingling, with respect to wool and mohair, a representative of the FSA county committee may determine an average production of the wool and mohair in a manner approved by CCC.

        (d)(1) Two or more producers may obtain:

        (i) A single joint MAL for commodities that are stored in the same farm storage facility; or

        (ii) Individual MALs for their share of the commodity that is commingled in a farm storage facility with commodities owned by other producers if such other producers execute an agreement that provides that such producers will obtain the permission of a representative of the county committee before removal of any quantity of the commodity from the storage facility. All producers who store a commodity in a farm storage facility in which commodities that have been pledged as collateral for a MAL will be liable for any damage incurred by CCC for the deterioration or unauthorized removal or disposition of such commodities.

        (2) In such cases, each producer must execute a note and security agreement with CCC, and each such producer will be jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the requirements of this part. Each producer is also liable for repayment of the entire MAL amount until the MAL is fully repaid without regard to their share in the commodity pledged as collateral. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and security agreement for the producer's claimed share in such commodities, or MAL proceeds, after execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.

        (e)(1) A producer, when requesting a MAL, will designate in writing specific storage structures.

        (2) The producer is not required to request prior approval before moving marketing assistance loan collateral between such designated structures.

        (3) Movement of MAL collateral to any other structures not designated or the disposal of such loan collateral without prior written approval of the county committee, will subject the producer to administrative actions.

        (4) The producer is responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of the farm-stored commodity pledged as collateral.

        (5) CCC will not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the MAL collateral for farm-stored MALs.

        (f) If the producer does not pay CCC the total amount due in accordance with a MAL by the maturity date, CCC has the right to acquire title to the MAL collateral and to sell or otherwise take possession of such collateral without any further action by the producer. With respect to farm-stored MALs, the producer may, as CCC determines, deliver the MAL collateral in accordance with instructions issued by CCC. CCC will not accept delivery of any quantity of a commodity in excess of 110 percent of the outstanding farm-stored MAL quantity. If a quantity in excess of 110 percent of the outstanding farm-stored MAL quantity is shown on the warehouse receipt or other documents, the producer must provide replacement warehouse receipts and delivery documents. If the warehouse receipt and such other documents applicable to the settlement are not replaced to reflect the excess amount, CCC will provide for such corrected documents and apply charges for such service, if any, to the producer's account as charges for settlement on the MAL.

        § 1421.106   Warehouse-stored MAL collateral.

#### § § 1421.106

        (a) A commodity may be pledged as collateral for a warehouse-stored MAL in the quantity delivered to CCC for storage at a warehouse that meets standards for approval at part 1423 of this chapter. Such quantity is the net weight specified on the warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate.

        (b) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint MAL for commodities stored in an approved warehouse if the warehouse receipt pledged as collateral is issued jointly to the producers.

        (c) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement with CCC, each such producer is jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and the regulations in this part. Each such producer also remains liable for repayment of the entire MAL amount until the MAL is fully repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in the commodity pledged as collateral for the MAL. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and security agreement with respect to the producer's claimed share in such commodities, or MAL proceeds, after execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.

        (d) Storage rates that CCC has approved to be deducted from MAL proceeds are available in FSA State and county offices and other USDA service centers. Deductions are based upon entries on the warehouse receipt or supplemental certificate, but the storage rate is not to exceed the storage rate CCC has approved. No storage deduction is to be made if written evidence acceptable to CCC is submitted indicating that:

        (1) Storage charges through the maturity date have been prepaid; or

        (2) The producer has arranged with the warehouse operator for the payment of storage charges through the maturity date and the warehouse operator enters an endorsement in substantially the following form on the warehouse receipt:

        (e) The beginning date to be used for computing storage deductions on the commodity stored in an approved warehouse will be the later of the following:

        (1) The date the commodity was received or deposited in the warehouse;

        (2) The date the storage charges start; or

        (3) The day following the date through which storage charges have been paid.

        (f) For hard red winter and hard red spring wheat tendered to CCC and stored in an approved warehouse, producers must obtain official protein content determinations or, as CCC determines is acceptable, protein content may be determined by mutual agreement between the producer and the warehouse operator. Costs of determinations will not be paid by CCC.

        § 1421.107   Warehouse receipts.

#### § § 1421.107

        (a) Warehouse receipts for MALs tendered to CCC as specified in § 1421.3 may either be paper or electronic. All receipts, whether paper or electronic, must meet all the applicable provisions of this section and this part, and CCC program document requirements. EWRs must be issued by a provider approved by CCC.

        (b) Warehouse receipts must be issued in the name of the eligible producer or CCC. If issued in the name of the eligible producer, the receipt must be properly endorsed on its reverse side certifying that the crop is free of encumbrances in order for title to vest in the holder. Receipts must be issued by an authorized warehouse and must represent a commodity that is deemed to be stored commingled. The receipts must be negotiable and must represent a commodity that is the same quantity and quality as the eligible commodity actually in storage in the warehouse of the original deposit.

        (c) If the receipt is issued for a commodity that is owned by the warehouse operator either solely, jointly, or in common with others, the fact of such ownership is to be stated on the receipt. In States where the pledge of warehouse receipts issued by a warehouse operator on the warehouse operator's commodity is invalid, the warehouse operator may offer the commodity to CCC for a MAL if such warehouse is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.

        (d) Each warehouse receipt or accompanying supplemental certificate representing a commodity stored in an authorized warehouse must indicate that the commodity is insured. CCC shall not be responsible for the cost of such insurance.

        (e) A separate warehouse receipt must be submitted for each grade and class of any commodity tendered to CCC and, for rice, such receipt must also state the milling yield of the rice, and for wool, such receipts must also state the yield and micron of the wool.

        (f) With respect to peanuts, a warehouse receipt must be submitted exhibiting grade, type, and segregation for peanuts tendered to CCC.

        (g)(1) Each warehouse receipt, or a supplemental certificate (in duplicate) that properly identifies the warehouse receipt, must be issued by an authorized warehouse as specified in § 1421.103(c)(1), as applicable, and must indicate:

        (i) The name and location of the storing warehouse;

        (ii) The warehouse code assigned by licensing authority;

        (iii) The warehouse receipt number;

        (iv) The date the receipt was issued;

        (v) The type of commodity;

        (vi) The date the commodity was deposited or received;

        (vii) The date to which storage has been paid or the storage start date;

        (viii) Whether the commodity was received by rail, truck or barge;

        (ix) The amount per bushel, pound, or hundredweight of prepaid in or out charges;

        (x) The signature of the warehouse operator or the authorized agent; and

        (xi) For warehouses operating under a merged warehouse code agreement (KC-385), the location and county to which the producer delivered the commodity.

        (2) In addition to the information specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, additional commodity specific requirements will be determined by CCC and be available at State and county offices and the Kansas City Commodity Office.

        (h) If a warehouse receipt indicates that the commodity tendered for MAL grades “infested” or “contains excess moisture,” or both, the receipt must be accompanied by a supplemental certificate in order for the commodity to be eligible for a MAL. The grade, grading factors, and quantity to be delivered must be shown on the certificate as follows:

        (1) When the warehouse receipt shows “infested” and the commodity has been conditioned to correct the infested condition, the supplemental certificate must show the same grade without the “infested” designation and the same grading factors and quantity as shown on the warehouse receipt.

        (2)(i) When the warehouse receipt shows that the commodity contained excess moisture and the commodity has been dried or blended, the supplemental certificate must show the grade, grading factors, and quantity after drying or blending of the commodity. Such entries must reflect a drying or blending shrinkage as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.

        (ii) When a supplemental certificate is issued under paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(2)(i) of this section, the grade, grading factors, and the quantity shown on such certificate will supersede the entries for such items on the warehouse receipt.

        (iii) If the commodity has been dried or blended to reduce the moisture content, the quantity specified on the warehouse receipt or the supplemental certificate represents the quantity after drying or blending.

        (iv) For commodities dried or blended under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, such quantity must reflect a minimum shrinkage in the receiving weight excluding dockage:

        (A) For the following commodities, 1.3 times the percentage difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and the following percentages for the specified commodity:

        () Barley: _1_4.5 percent;

        () Corn: 15.5 percent;

        () Grain sorghum: 14.0 percent;

        () Oats: 1_4_.0 percent;

        () Rice: 14.0 percent;

        () Soybeans: 14.0 percent;

        () Wheat: 13.5 percent; and

        () Peanuts: 10.0 percent.

        (B) For the following commodities, 1.1 times the percentage difference between the moisture content of the commodity received and the following percentages for the specified commodity:

        () Canola: _1_0.0 percent;

        () Flaxseed: 9.0 percent;

        () Mustard Seed: 10.0 percent;

        () Rapeseed: 10.0 percent;

        () Safflower Seed: 10.0 percent;

        () Sunflower Seed: 10.0 percent;

        () Crambe: 10.0 percent; and

        () Sesame Seed: 10.0 percent.

        (i)(1) If, under paragraph (g) of this section, a supplemental certificate is issued in connection with a warehouse receipt, such certificate must state that no lien for processing will be asserted by the warehouse operator against CCC or any subsequent holder of such receipt.

        (2) Warehouse receipts and the commodities represented by such receipts may be subject to a lien for warehouse charges. For all commodities except peanuts, the producer who pledged such a receipt as collateral for a MAL under this part pays to CCC all costs incurred by CCC as result of the existence of the lien. In no event is a warehouse operator entitled to satisfy such a lien by sale of the commodities when CCC is the holder of such receipt.

        (j) Warehouse receipts representing commodities that have been shipped by rail or by barge, must be accompanied by supplemental certificates completed under paragraph (g) of this section.

        (k) If the warehouse issues an EWR for the commodity, the producer must notify the EWR provider to make CCC the holder of the EWR and to secure an affirmation verifying that CCC has been made the holder of the EWR.

        § 1421.108   Transfers and reconcentrations.

#### § § 1421.108

        (a) Upon request by the producer before transfer, the county committee may approve the transfer of a quantity of a commodity that is pledged as collateral for a farm-stored MAL to a warehouse-stored MAL at any time during the MAL period.

        (1) Transfer of all or part of the farm-stored MAL collateral to an authorized warehouse will be made through the pledge of warehouse receipts for the commodity placed under a warehouse-stored MAL. The loan rate of the transferred MAL will be the same as the loan rate of the original MAL. The MAL quantity for the warehouse-stored MAL cannot exceed the loan quantity transferred from the farm-stored MAL.

        (2) Any amounts due the producer will be disbursed by the FSA county service center.

        (b) The producer must request county committee approval before the transfer of a warehouse-stored MAL to a farm-stored MAL. The county committee may approve the transfer of part or all of a warehouse-stored MAL at any time during the MAL period. Quantities pledged as collateral for a farm-stored MAL will be based on a measurement or a calculation of average production of wool and mohair, by a representative of the county office before approving the farm-stored MAL. The producer must immediately repay the amount by which the farm-stored MAL is less than the warehouse-stored MAL and charges plus interest on the shortage. The maturity date of the farm-stored MAL is the maturity date applicable to the warehouse-stored MAL that was transferred.

        (c) Upon the filing of the Reconcentration Agreement and Trust Receipt by the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may, during the MAL period, approve the reconcentration in another authorized warehouse for all or part of a commodity that is pledged as collateral for a warehouse-stored MAL. Any such approval will be subject to the terms and conditions in the Reconcentration Agreement and Trust Receipt. A producer may, before the new warehouse receipt is delivered to CCC, pay CCC:

        (1) The principal amount of the MAL and charges plus interest and applicable charges; or

        (2) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of the MAL and charges plus interest under the terms and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the commodity pledged as collateral for such MAL.

        § 1421.109   Personal liability of the producer.

#### § § 1421.109

        (a) When a producer obtains a commodity MAL, the producer agrees, in writing, not to:

        (1) Provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent or erroneous representation for the MAL;

        (2) Remove or dispose of a quantity of commodity that is collateral for a CCC farm-stored MAL without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with § 1421.10; or

        (3) Violate the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement, which will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a commodity that is not actually in existence or for a quantity on which the producer is not eligible. If CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms and conditions of the applicable forms prescribed by CCC, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.

        (b) Such violations as referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section may include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Incorrect certification;

        (2) Unauthorized removal; and

        (3) Unauthorized disposition.

        (c) If the county committee determines that the producer has committed such violations, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.

        (d) Liquidated damages assessed in accordance with this section will be determined by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the MAL rate applicable to the MAL note.

        (e) When it has been determined that a violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement has occurred as a result of unauthorized removal or disposition, CCC will determine the quantity of the commodity involved with respect to such violation and require the repayment of that portion of the MAL which is equivalent to such quantity of the commodity. In the case of these violations, if CCC determines the producer:

        (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages will be assessed according to paragraph (d) of this section and the commodity involved in the violation must be redeemed at the lesser of:

        (i) The rate at which the MAL was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement; or

        (ii) The alternative repayment rate in effect on the date of the determination is issued by CCC that a violation has occurred, plus 15 percent of the original MAL rate as provided on the note and security agreement.

        (2) Did not act in good faith when the violation was committed, liquidated damages will be assessed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and administrative actions will be taken in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The MAL is required to be redeemed at the rate at which the MAL was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement.

        (f) When it has been determined that a violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement has occurred as result of an incorrect certification, CCC will determine the quantity of the commodity involved with respect to such violation and require the repayment of that portion of the MAL which is equivalent to such quantity of the commodity. In the case of an incorrect certification, if CCC determines the producer:

        (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages will be assessed according to paragraph (d) of this section, and the commodity involved in the violation must be redeemed at the rate at which the MAL was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement.

        (2) Did not act in good faith about the violation, liquidated damages will be assessed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and administrative actions will be taken in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The MAL must be redeemed at the rate at which the MAL was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement.

        (g) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 days from the date of notification of violations as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f)(1) of this section, the producer must immediately repay the MAL at the rate at which the MAL was disbursed plus interest, and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement.

        (h) For violations as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (f)(2) of this section, the producer must immediately repay the MAL at the rate at which the MAL was disbursed plus interest, and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement. If the MAL has already been repaid, any market loan gain previously realized on the MAL, plus interest, is immediately due to CCC. CCC will demand delivery of any remaining MAL collateral if the MAL and any other charges and interest are not repaid within the 30 calendar day notification period specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (i) If the county committee determines that the producer has committed a violation, the county committee will notify the producer in writing that:

        (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide sufficient evidence and information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to the county committee; and

        (2) Administrative actions will be taken.

        (j) If the MAL is accelerated, the producer may not repay the MAL at the alternative loan repayment rate, unless authorized by CCC.

        (k) Producers denied or rejected for a farm-stored MAL for any reason under this section may apply for a warehouse-stored MAL.

        (l) The MAL plus other charges are payable to CCC upon demand if a producer:

        (1) Makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a MAL, maintaining, or settling a MAL; or

        (2) Disposes or moves the MAL collateral without the approval of CCC.

        (m) A producer is personally liable for damages resulting from a commodity delivered to or removed by CCC containing mercurial compounds, toxin producing molds, or other substances poisonous or harmful to humans or animals or property.

        (n) If the amount disbursed under a MAL or in settlement of the MAL, exceeds the amount authorized by this part, the producer is liable for repayment of the excess and charges, plus interest.

        (o) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the MAL is less than the amount required under this part, the producer is personally liable for repayment of the amount of such difference and charges, plus interest.

        (p) In the case of joint MALs, the personal liability for the amounts specified in this section is joint and several on the part of each producer signing the note.

        (q) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under this section may be waived if the CCC determines that the violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or unintentionally.

        § 1421.110   Commodity certificate exchanges.

#### § § 1421.110

        (a) For any outstanding marketing assistance loan, a producer may purchase a commodity certificate and exchange that commodity certificate for the marketing assistance loan collateral.

        (b) The exchange rate is the lessor of:

        (1) The loan rate and charges, plus interest applicable to the loan; or

        (2) The prevailing world market price, as determined by CCC, or the alternative repayment rate for all other commodities, as determined by CCC.

        (c) Commodity certificate exchanges may not be used when locking in a repayment rate under § 1421.10.

        (d) Producers must request a commodity certificate exchange on or before loan maturity in person at the FSA county office that disbursed the marketing assistance loan by:

        (1) Completing a written request on the form or providing the information as required by CCC;

        (2) Purchasing a commodity certificate for the exact amount required to exchange the marketing assistance loan collateral; or

        (3) Immediately exchanging the purchased commodity certificate for the outstanding loan collateral.

        (e) Loan gains realized from a commodity certificate exchange are not subject to AGI provisions specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        § 1421.111   MAL settlement.

#### § § 1421.111

        (a) The value of MALs at settlement will be determined by CCC on the following basis:

        (1) For nonrecourse MALs, the schedule of premiums and discounts for the commodity, provided that if the value of the eligible delivered collateral at settlement is:

        (i) Less than the amount due, the producer will pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency and charges, plus interest on such deficiency; or

        (ii) More than the amount due, the amount of such excess will be paid to the producer or, if applicable, to the producer and applicable secured creditors of the producer.

        (2) For recourse MALs, full repayment of principal plus interest is required. As specified in § 1421.113, recourse MAL collateral may not be delivered or forfeited to CCC in satisfaction of indebtedness.

        (3) If CCC sells the commodity described in paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section in settlement of the MAL, the sales proceeds will be applied to the amount owed as follows:

        (i) For nonrecourse MALs, CCC will in all instances retain all proceeds obtained from the sale of the eligible commodity and will not make any payment of any amount of such proceeds to any party, including the producer who has satisfied their obligation under the MAL through delivery of the commodity to CCC. CCC will settle with the producer based on the quality and quantity of the commodity; or

        (ii) For recourse MALs, the sales proceeds from the eligible collateral will be applied to the amount owed CCC by the producer. The producer will be responsible for any costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale and CCC will deduct the amount of these costs from the sale proceeds. If:

        (A) The amount received from the sale of the collateral is less than the amount due, the producer will pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency and costs, plus interest on the remaining amount owed; or

        (B) The amount received from the sale of the collateral is greater than the sum of the amount due, the amount of such excess will be paid to the producer or, if applicable, to the producer and applicable secured creditor of the producer.

        (b) Settlements made by CCC for eligible commodities that are acquired by CCC and that are stored in an authorized warehouse will be made on the basis of the entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents.

        (1) All eligible commodities that are stored in other than authorized warehouses must be delivered to CCC as CCC instructs. Settlement will be based on entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents.

        (2) For eligible loan commodities that are delivered from other than an authorized warehouse, settlement will be made by CCC on the basis of the basic MAL rate that is in effect for the commodity at the producer's customary delivery point, as determined by CCC.

        (c) Settlements made by CCC for peanuts acquired by CCC and stored in an authorized warehouse will be based on the settlement value at the time of the loan disbursement and the entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents subject to adjustments for changes in quality and other factors.

        (1) All eligible commodities that are stored in other than authorized warehouses will be delivered to CCC as CCC instructs. Settlement will be based on entries in the applicable warehouse receipt, supplemental certificate, and accompanying documents.

        (2) For eligible loan commodities that are delivered from other than an authorized warehouse, settlement shall be made by CCC on the basis of the basic marketing assistance loan rate that is in effect for the commodity at the producer's customary delivery point, as determined by CCC.

        (d) For peanuts forfeited to CCC, the Secretary will pay reasonable storage, handling, and other associated costs for all peanuts pledged as collateral that are forfeited under this section.

        (e) In all cases, settlements may be adjusted for changes in quality and other factors affecting the value of the commodity.

        (f) Premiums and discounts will apply to all eligible loan commodities that are forfeited and delivered to CCC. There will not be any additional adjustments for peanuts at settlement, because such premiums and discounts will be accounted for when a peanut MAL is made.

        (g) If a deficiency exists after the collateral securing a nonrecourse MAL has been delivered to CCC or a recourse MAL sold under a local sale, a receivable for such deficiency will be established as specified in part 1403 of this chapter.

        (h) CCC will not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the loan collateral for any farm-stored MALs.

#### § § 1421.112

        (a)(1) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a warehouse-stored MAL, title to the unredeemed collateral securing the MAL will immediately vest in CCC.

        (2) Upon maturity and nonpayment of a farm-stored MAL, title to the unredeemed collateral will automatically transfer to CCC upon CCC demand.

        (3) When CCC acquires title to the unredeemed collateral, CCC will not pay for any market value that such collateral may have in excess of the MAL indebtedness, (the unpaid amount of the note and charges plus interest).

        (b) If the total amount due on a farm-stored MAL (the unpaid amount of the note plus charges, and interest) is not satisfied upon maturity, CCC may remove the commodity from storage, and assign, transfer, and deliver the commodity or documents evidencing title thereto when, how, and upon terms as CCC determines. Disposition may also be affected without removing the commodity from storage. The commodity may be processed before sale and CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or any part of the commodity at either a public or private sale.

        (1) The value of settlement for a farm-stored commodity removed by CCC from storage and will be as provided in § 1421.111.

        (2) If a deficiency exists after the collateral is sold, a receivable for such deficiency will be established in accordance with part 1403 of this title.

        § 1421.200   Applicability.

#### § § 1421.200

        (a) During the MAL availability period, LDPs will be made available to eligible producers when the alternative repayment rate is less than the applicable county loan rate.

        (b) To be eligible to receive LDPs a producer must:

        (1) Comply with all MAL eligibility including beneficial interest requirements.

        (2) Agree to forgo obtaining such MAL, if applicable; and

        (3) File in person, by mail or electronically a request for payment on a form prescribed by CCC; and

        (4) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.

        (c)(1) A producer must submit to the FSA Service Center a completed request for a LDP on forms prescribed by CCC. This submission must be received on or before the date beneficial interest is lost in the commodity and before the final loan availability date for the commodity. Such completed and submitted forms indicate the producer's intentions and further provide the terms and conditions of the LDP program. If all or any of the provisions of this paragraph are not met by the producer, the producer may not obtain the LDP benefit.

        (2) With respect to a request for a LDP for unshorn pelts, a completed request for such a payment must be submitted on or before the earlier of the date of slaughter of the lamb or the loss of beneficial interest in the lamb or the unshorn pelt produced from the lamb. In addition, the lamb must have been owned for not less than 30 days prior to the date such application is filed with CCC and must have been slaughtered for personal use, or sold for slaughter and slaughtered within 10 calendar days after the sale.

        (d) For unshorn pelts, the lamb must be owned for a period of not less than 30 days in advance of the application and sold for immediate slaughter or slaughtered for personal use. Producers must submit acceptable production evidence to CCC under § 1421.12 at the time of request. Producers who do not sell lambs for immediate slaughter are ineligible for a LDP.

        (e) AGI requirements apply as specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        § 1421.201   Loan deficiency payment rate.

#### § § 1421.201

        (a) The LDP rate for a crop will be the amount by which the loan rate for the crop exceeds the rate at which CCC has announced that producers may repay their MALs as specified in § 1421.10.

        (b) The LDP rate will be the rate in effect in the county where the commodity was marketed or stored on the date:

        (1) The request for benefits is received in the FSA Service Center, if the producer retains beneficial interest in the quantity on that date.

        (2) Beneficial interest was lost, as determined by CCC and as provided in §§ 1421.6 and 1421.13, if on the date the request for benefits was received in the FSA Service Center the producer no longer has beneficial interest in the requested quantity.

        (3) The commodity is delivered, if the producer elects to receive the LDP rate based on the date of delivery.

        (c) The LDP applicable to such crop will be computed by multiplying the LDP rate, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, by the quantity of the crop the producer is eligible to pledge as collateral for a nonrecourse MAL for which the LDP is requested.

        § 1421.202   Loan deficiency payment quantity.

#### § § 1421.202

        (a) A LDP may be based on 100 percent of the net eligible quantity specified on acceptable evidence of production of the commodity certified as eligible for LDP if such production evidence is provided for such commodity under § 1421.12.

        (b) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint LDP for commodities that are stored in the same storage facility. Two or more producers may obtain individual LDPs for their share of the commodity that is stored commingled in a farm storage facility with commodities for which an LDP has been requested and will be liable for any damage incurred by CCC for incorrect certification of such commodities under § 1421.203.

        (c) Two or more producers may obtain a single joint LDP for commodities that are stored in an authorized or unauthorized warehouse if the acceptable documentation representing an eligible commodity for which a LDP is requested is completed jointly for such producers.

        § 1421.203   Personal liability of the producer.

#### § § 1421.203

        (a) When a producer requests a LDP, the producer agrees:

        (1) When signing the LDP Agreement and Request, as applicable, that the producer will not provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent representation, that CCC will rely upon when determining eligibility for a LDP; and

        (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of the LDP request, as applicable, will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer for a quantity of a commodity that is not actually in existence or for a quantity on which the producer is not eligible. If CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms and conditions of the applicable forms prescribed by CCC, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.

        (b) Liquidated damages assessed in accordance with this section will be determined by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the LDP.

        (c) If CCC determines that the producer:

        (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages will be assessed according to paragraph (b) of this section and the producer must repay the LDP applicable to the loan deficiency quantity involved in the violation and charges, plus interest applicable to the amount repaid. If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 days from the date of notification the producer must repay the entire LDP and any other charges plus interest.

        (2) Did not act in good faith when the violation was committed, liquidated damages will be assessed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and the producer shall repay the entire LDP and any other charges plus interest.

        (d) CCC may waive the liquidated damages assessed according to paragraph (b) of this section if the CCC determines that the violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or unintentionally.

        (e) If, for any violation to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, the county committee determines that CCC's interest is not or will not be protected, the county committee will:

        (1) Accelerate the maturity date on the producer's outstanding farm-stored MALs;

        (2) Deny future farm-stored MALs for the current and 2 following crop years;

        (3) Deny LDPs for the current and 2 following crop years unless production evidence is presented to CCC. Depending on the severity of the violation, the county committee may deny future farm-stored MALs and LDPs without production evidence.

        (f) If the county committee determines that the producer has committed a violation, the county committee will notify the producer in writing that:

        (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide sufficient evidence and information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to the county committee; and

        (2) Administrative action will be taken under this section.

        (g) If the amount disbursed under LDPs exceeds the amount authorized by this part, the producer is liable for repayment of such excess and liquidated damages, plus interest.

        (h) In the case of joint LDPs, the personal liability for the amounts specified in this section is joint and several on the part of each producer signing the LDP application.

        (i) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.

        § 1421.301   Administration.

#### § § 1421.301

        (a) This subpart will be administered by the FSA under the general direction and supervision of the Executive Vice President, CCC or designee. The program will be carried out in the field by State and county FSA employees under the general direction and supervision of the State and county FSA committees.

        (b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees thereof, do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations in this part, as amended or supplemented.

        (c) The State committee will take any action required by this part which has not been taken by the county committee. The State committee will also:

        (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action taken by such county committee which is not in accordance with the regulations of this part; or

        (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action which is not in accordance with the regulations of this part.

        (d) No delegation herein to a State or county committee will preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

        (e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP), FSA, may authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other program requirements in cases where timeliness or failure to meet such other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the program. In addition, DAFP may establish other conditions for payments that will assist in achieving the goals of the program and may include such provisions in the program agreement or other program documents.

        § 1421.302   Eligible producer and eligible land.

#### § § 1421.302

        (a) To be an eligible producer for a payment under this subpart, the person must be a producer of wheat, barley, oats, or triticale in the applicable crop years. Also, to be an eligible producer, the person must meet all other qualifications for payment that are set out in this subpart, set out in parts 12, 718, 1400, and 1405 of this title. A person will not be considered the producer of the crop unless that person was responsible for the planting of the crop and had control and title of the crop at all times, including, at the time of planting and the time of the request for a payment under, this subpart.

        (b) A minor may participate in the program if the right of majority has been conferred on the minor by court order or by statute, or if the minor participates through a guardian authorized to act on the minor's behalf in these matters. Alternatively, a minor may participate if the program documents are all signed by an acceptable (to CCC) guarantor or if bond, acceptable to CCC, is provided by a surety.

        (c) For the crop to be eligible, the crop, in addition to other standards that may apply, must be grown on land that is classified as “cropland” in FSA farm records or on land that FSA determines has been cropped in the last 3 years except that the land may also qualify if the land is committed to a crop rotation, normal for the locality, that includes harvesting the subject crop for grain. These rules are designed to assure, to the extent practicable, the available payment did not produce plantings that otherwise would not have occurred and the CCC may deny payments in any instance in which there is reason to believe that the planting was done for that purpose. To that end, if the commodity involved has not been previously grown by the producer or is not one which is not predominately produced locally, the producer must submit evidence of seed purchases for planting the commodities and other evidence deemed needed or appropriate by the COC in order to assure that the program goals are made and that the land was not planted to an eligible commodity simply to obtain a payment. Also, the land to be eligible must, for the year involved, be grazed and cannot, during the crop year, be harvested at any time for any purpose, except as determined by the Deputy Administrator to accommodate producers with a history of double-cropping when the crop to be harvested is not the crop for which a payment is to be made under this subpart. Land will be considered grazed only to the extent that the crop on the land is consumed in the field as live plants by livestock for the normal period of time for grazing in the area.

        (d)(1) A producer must, at the time the LDP agreement is signed, meet all other eligibility criteria for obtaining LDPs including AGI requirements as specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        (2) For producers of triticale who obtain a payment under this subpart the producer must enter into an agreement with CCC to forgo any harvesting of triticale on the acreage for which such a payment is made.

        (e)(1) No payment will be made if the crop could not have been harvested because of weather conditions or any other reason.

        (2) The producer must retain the control and title of the commodity for which the payment is sought from the date of planting through the date on which mechanical harvesting of the crop would normally occur.

        (f) Producers who elect to graze their wheat, barley, oats, or triticale will not be eligible for an indemnity under the Federal Crop Insurance Program provisions of Chapter IV of this title or a payment under the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program authorized under part 1437 of this chapter.

        § 1421.303   Time and method for application.

#### § § 1421.303

        (a) Application for the program provided in this subpart must be received, at the FSA county office that is responsible for administering programs for the farm, no earlier than the date on which eligible crops would normally be harvested and no later than the final loan availability date as determined in accordance with § 1421.5.

        (b) The application must describe the land to be grazed and, in accordance with standards set by CCC, the tract or field location.

        (c) The COC will determine the first harvest date, taking into account the date on which such crops are normally harvested locally for any purpose.

        (d) Where multiple producers are involved, the application must specify each producer's share in the crop.

        (1) A producer may only receive payments under this subpart that are commensurate with that producer's share in the crop as specified on the application.

        (2) Should a person who is entitled to receive a payment under this subpart die, that payment, as earned, may be made to other persons as provided for in the rules specified in part 707 of this title.

        (3) Third parties may also receive payments to the extent provided for in part 707 of this title for other situations involving an incapacitation of the producer.

        (e) Refusals to allow CCC to verify information on any application or report used for this subpart can result in program ineligibility and producers must provide CCC, FSA, and its agent access to the property involved and to all records as may be relevant to the making of payments under this subpart.

        (f) False statements will disqualify the producer from the program and may be subject to other sanctions including criminal sanctions.

        § 1421.304   Payment amount.

#### § § 1421.304

        (a) The grazing payment rate will be the LDP in effect for the farm on the date which the producer submits a complete program application to CCC. For triticale, the grazing rate will be equal to the LDP rate in effect for the predominant class of wheat in the county where the farm is located as of the date the application is filed.

        (b) The payable units of production will be computed by multiplying the eligible grazed acres by the applicable yield determined under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) The payment yield will be:

        (1) The yield for the loan commodity on the farm in effect for the calculation of Price Loss Coverage as specified in part 1412 of this chapter;

        (2) For a farm for which Agriculture Risk Coverage is elected, the payment yield that would otherwise be in effect for that loan commodity on the farm in the absence of such election as specified in part 1412 of this chapter; or

        (3) In the case of a farm for which no payment yield is established for the loan commodity on the farm, an appropriate yield as determined by the COC.

        (d) Payments can be withheld until the actual grazed acreage is verified and justified in connection with any other reports filed with FSA with respect to the farm (or filed with some other person or agency) and until all other necessary information is obtained. CCC may require such other verification as it deems appropriate to assure that the program goals are met.

        (e) To receive the payment, the eligible producer must submit a request for payment on an application form as prescribed by CCC or FSA. The application may be obtained from the county FSA office, or from the USDA or FSA web site in the Internet. The form must be submitted to the county by the close of business on or before March 31 of the calendar year following the year the crop is normally harvested.

        (f) The producer will be ineligible for payments under this subpart if any discrepancies between the reported acreage on the program form and other reports of acreage by the producer are not resolved by a date set by CCC.

        § 1421.305   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1421.305

        (a) A producer is ineligible to receive payments under this subpart if it is determined by DAFP, the State committee, or the county committee to have:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device which tends to defeat the purpose of this program;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

        (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this subpart to a producer engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other person as a result of the producer's actions, will be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any producer engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any person receiving payment under this subpart, as a result of such acts, will be jointly and severally liable for any refund due under this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this subpart will be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may apply.

        § 1421.306   Refunds; joint and several liability.

#### § § 1421.306

        (a) In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, requirement, or condition for payment arising under this application, of this subpart, and if any refund of a payment to CCC becomes due for that or other reason in connection with the application, of this subpart, all payments made under this subpart to any producer are to be refunded to CCC together with interest as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and late-payment charges as provided for in part 1402 of this chapter.

        (b) All persons listed on an application are jointly and severally liable for any refund due in connection with that application and for any related charges which may be determined to be due for any reason.

        (c) Interest is applicable to refunds required from the producer. Interest will be charged at the rate of interest which the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC made such benefits available. Interest will accrue from the date such benefits were made available to the date of repayment but the interest rate will increase to reflect any increase in the rate charged to CCC by Treasury for any percent of time for which the interest assessment is collected. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action of the producer.

        (d) Late payment interest will be assessed on refunds in accordance with the provisions of, and subject to the rates in part 1403 of this chapter.

        (e) Producers must refund to CCC any excess payments made by CCC with respect to any application in which they have an interest. Such refund will be subject to interest at the same rate that applies to other refunds.

      Warehouse operators with net worth equal to or greater than the minimum net worth required, but less than the total net worth for the commodity involved in the particular agreement, may satisfy the net worth deficiency by furnishing one of the following:

      (a) A bond which:

      (1) Is executed by a surety approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury so long as the surety maintains someone authorized to accept service of legal process in the State where the warehouse is located.

      (2) Is executed on either a bond form obtained from CCC, or which is furnished under State law or operational rules for non-governmental supervisory agencies, if approved by CCC, so long as CCC determines that such alternative bond:

      (i) Provides adequate protection to CCC;

      (ii) Has been executed by a surety approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or has an acceptable blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement being the same as that of the surety under the original bond; and

      (iii) Is effective for at least 1 year and cannot be canceled without 120 days notice to CCC. Excess coverage on a bond for one warehouse will not be accepted by CCC against insufficient bond coverage on other warehouses;

      (b) Cash and negotiable securities. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be returned to the warehouse operator when the period for which coverage was required has ended and CCC determines there is no liability under the storage agreement;

      (c) An irrevocable letter of credit meeting CCC requirements that is effective for at least 1 year and cannot be canceled without 120 days notice to CCC. The issuing bank must be a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a financial institution subject to the Farm Credit Act; or

      (d) Other alternative instruments and forms of financial assurance as the AMS Administrator determines appropriate to secure the warehouse operator's compliance with this section.

      § 1423.8   Approval or rejection.

#### § § 1423.8

      (a) CCC will notify warehouse operators approved under this part in writing. Such approval does not relieve the warehouse operator of any obligation under any agreement to CCC or any other agency of the United States, and does not obligate CCC to use the warehouse.

      (b) CCC will notify the warehouse operator of rejection under this part in writing. The notification will state the causes for rejection. CCC will reconsider a warehouse for approval when the warehouse operator establishes that the reasons for rejection have been remedied or requests reconsideration of the action and presents to the Director, Warehouse and Commodity Management Division, AMS, in writing, information in support of such request. The warehouse operator may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal hearing by submitting a request with the AMS Administrator. Appeals shall be as prescribed in part 780 of this title.

> [71 FR 35773, June 22, 2006, as amended at 71 FR 42017, July 25, 2006; 84 FR 29033, June 21, 2019]

      § 1423.9   Examination of warehouses.

#### § § 1423.9

      Before approval, and while a storage agreement is in effect, a warehouse must be examined by a person designated by CCC periodically to determine compliance with this part. CCC or any other agency of USDA shall, at any time, have the right to inspect the warehouse storage facilities and any applicable records. Inspection or examination by CCC does not absolve the warehouse operator of any failure to comply with this part that CCC does not discover. Failure to allow access to facilities as required under this paragraph will result in rejection or revocation of approval.

      § 1423.10   Exceptions for United States Warehouse Act licensed warehouses.

#### § § 1423.10

      The financial requirements, net worth alternatives and examination provisions of this part do not apply if the warehouse operator is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act (USWA) for such commodities, but an examination under this part will be made of such a warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is necessary to protect its interests.

      § 1423.11   Delivery and shipping standards for cotton warehouses.

#### § § 1423.11

      (a) Unless prevented from doing so by severe weather conditions, fire, explosion, flood, earthquake, insurrection, riot, strike, labor dispute, acts of civil or military authority, non-availability of transportation facilities or any cause beyond the control of the warehouse operator that renders performance impossible, the warehouse operator will:

      (1) Deliver stored cotton without unnecessary delay.

      (2) Be considered to have delivered cotton without unnecessary delay if the warehouse operator has made available for shipment at least 4.5 percent of its applicable storage capacity in effect, measured as the bales made available for shipment (BMAS):

      (i) During the relevant week of shipment; or

      (ii) Calculated as the two-week, rolling average of the BMAS for the relevant week of shipment and the BMAS for the immediately preceding week; or

      (iii) Calculated as the two-week, rolling average of the BMAS for the relevant week of shipment and the BMAS for the immediately succeeding week.

      (b) The warehouse operator shall provide a written report to CCC on a weekly basis. The reporting week shall be the seven day period starting at midnight following the close of business on each Saturday and ending at midnight after close of business of the following Saturday. Before close of business of the first business day of the following week, the warehouse operator will provide following information to CCC:

      (1) BMAS during such week is defined as any cotton bales that have been delivered or are scheduled and ready for delivery but not picked up during such week;

      (2) Active shipping orders, by week; and

      (3) Applicable storage capacity that is the higher of CCC approved capacity or the maximum number of bales stored at any time during the applicable crop year.

      (c) The warehouse operator may resolve any claim for noncompliance from any entity other than CCC with the cotton shipping standard in a court of competent jurisdiction or through mutually agreed upon arbitration procedures. In no case will CCC provide assistance or representation to parties involved in arbitration proceedings arising with respect to activities authorized under the Cotton Storage Agreement.

      § 1423.12   Application, inspection, and annual agreement fees.

#### § § 1423.12

      Each warehouse operator not licensed under USWA shall pay to CCC a fee or fees, including an application fee, inspection fee, and an annual agreement fee for each warehouse approved by CCC or for which approval is sought. The terms and conditions of such fees will be set forth in the applicable agreement.

      § 1423.13   Appeals, suspensions, and debarment.

#### § § 1423.13

      (a) After initial approval, warehouse operators may request that CCC reconsider adverse actions when the warehouse operator establishes that the reasons for the action have been remedied or requests reconsideration of the action and presents to the Director, Warehouse and Commodity Management Division, AMS, in writing, information in support of such request. The warehouse operator may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal hearing by submitting a request to the AMS Administrator. Appeals shall be as prescribed in part 780 of this title, and under such regulations the warehouse operator shall be considered as a “participant.”

      (b) Suspension and debarment actions taken under this part shall be conducted in accordance with part 1407 of this chapter. After expiration of the suspension or debarment period, a warehouse operator may, at any time, apply for approval under this part.

      producer means a producer that produces and sells biodiesel who is also registered and in compliance with section 211 (b) of the Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990.

      means ethanol and biodiesel produced from eligible commodities.

      means:

      (1) For ethanol production, a factor that converts the number of ethanol gallons back to commodity units as determined in the manner announced by CCC;

      (2) For biodiesel production, the factor that will treat 1.4 gallons of biodiesel produced as having involved the consumption of one bushel of soybeans in any case when the feedstock was an eligible commodity that has a corresponding oil or grease market price; if there is none, then the factor shall be as determined and announced by CCC.

      means barley; corn; grain sorghum; oats; rice; wheat; soybeans; cotton seed; sunflower seed; canola; crambe; rapeseed; safflower; sesame seed; flaxseed; mustard seed; cellulosic crops, such as switchgrass and hybrid poplars; fats, oils, and greases (including recycled fats, oils and greases) derived from an agricultural product; and any animal byproduct (in addition to oils, fats and greases) that may be used to produce bioenergy, as CCC determines, that is produced in the United States and its territories.

      § 1424.4   General eligibility rules.

#### § § 1424.4

      (a) An applicant must be determined eligible by KCCO and be assigned an agreement number.

      (b) To be eligible for program payments, a producer must maintain records indicating for all relevant FY's and FY quarters:

      (1) The use of eligible commodities in bioenergy production;

      (2) The quantity of bioenergy produced from an eligible commodity by location;

      (3) The quantity of eligible commodity used by location to produce the bioenergy referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

      (4) All other records, needed, or required by the agreement to establish program eligibility and compliance.

      (c) A producer must allow verification by CCC of all information provided. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of USDA to verify any information provided will result in a producer being determined not eligible.

      (d) For producers not purchasing raw commodity inputs, the production must equal or exceed that amount of production that would be calculated using the raw commodity inputs and the conversion factor set out in § 1424.3. A producer that purchases soy oil from a soybean crushing plant for further refinement into biodiesel must be able to prove to CCC's satisfaction both soy oil purchases and biodiesel production for the applicable quarter. Any special conversion factors needed will be the province of CCC and CCC alone and CCC's decision will be final.

      (e) A producer must meet all other conditions set out in these regulations, in the agreement, or in other program documents.

      § 1424.5   Agreement process.

#### § § 1424.5

      (a) To participate, an eligible producer must submit a signed agreement during the FY sign-up period. Agreements may be for single or multiple FY's. However, multiple FY agreements require producers to submit annual production estimate reports during each applicable FY sign-up period. Such reports must comply with the terms of the agreement and this part. In all cases, the accounting for compliance will be made on a per FY basis.

      (b) Sign-up each FY will be held for 30 calendar days beginning for:

      (1) FY 2003 on the date of publication of this rule;

      (2) FY 2004 and beyond on August 1 of the FY before the applicable FY.

      (c) After agreements are submitted:

      (1) If determined eligible by KCCO, an agreement number will be assigned, and a notification will be mailed to the producer;

      (2) If additional information is needed for KCCO to determine eligibility, the producer will be contacted as soon as practicable and requested to provide additional supporting documentation;

      (3) If determined ineligible by KCCO, producers will be notified in writing that their agreement was rejected and the reason for the determination.

      § 1424.6   Payment application process.

#### § § 1424.6

      (a) To apply for payments under this program during an FY, an eligible producer must:

      (1) Submit an application or eligibility report for each quarter. Submit the last quarterly application or report of the FY within 30 calendar days of the end of the FY for which payment is requested. If the actual deadline is a non-workday, the deadline will be the next business day;

      (2) Certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided;

      (3) Furnish CCC such certification, and access to such records, as CCC considers necessary to verify compliance with program provisions; and

      (4) Provide documentation as requested by CCC of both the producer's net purchases of eligible commodities and net production of bioenergy compared to such production at all locations during the relevant periods. CCC may adjust the formulaic payments otherwise payable to the producer if there is a difference between the amount actually used and certified and the amount of increased commodity use calculated under the formula.

      (b) After applications or reports are submitted, eligible producers:

      (1) Shall submit such additional supporting documentation as requested by KCCO when additional information is needed to determine eligibility;

      (2) Will be notified in writing of their ineligibility and reason for the determination, when the application is determined ineligible by KCCO; and

      (3) Shall promptly refund payments when a refund to CCC is due. If a refund is not made promptly, CCC may establish a claim.

      § 1424.7   Gross payable units.

#### § § 1424.7

      (a) For ethanol, producers will be eligible for payments on gross payable units for only their ethanol production from eligible inputs that exceeds, for the program year to date, their total comparable production at all locations as compared to the comparable portion of the previous year. Producers of ethanol are not eligible for base production payments. Producers shall not be paid twice for the same increase and any decline in relative production between quarters will require a comparable refund. For example, if at the end of the first quarter, a producer were to be paid for an increase of 500 gallons of ethanol, but at the end of the second quarter, that producer's year-to-date production was down to a net increase for the year of 450 gallons, then a refund would be due for the loss of the corresponding 50 gallons of net extra production. Repayment rates shall be based on previous payment rates. Unless otherwise determined by CCC, the extra ethanol production from eligible inputs will be converted to gross payable units by dividing the gallons of increased ethanol by the applicable conversion factor.

      (b) Biodiesel producers will be eligible for payments on gross payable units for all biodiesel production from eligible inputs. For eligibility purposes there will be two kinds of payment: additional production payments (APP), and base production payments (BPP). Repayment rates shall be based on previous payment rates. Unless otherwise determined by CCC, gross payable units for biodiesel production from eligible inputs will be calculated as follows:

      (1) For APP, by dividing the gallons of increased biodiesel by the biodiesel conversion factor of 1.4. APP payments will be made on increases as compared with the previous FY. Producers will not be paid twice for the same production. Failure to maintain year to date biodiesel production increases between quarters will require a comparable APP refund as specified below. That is, for example, if a producer were to be paid, at the end of the first quarter, for 500 gallons of increased biodiesel production, but by the end of the second quarter that producer's production, for the year to date, was only 450 gallons, then a refund of the APP premium would be due for the loss of the corresponding 50 gallons of net production increase.

      (2) For BPP, which will be made on production not eligible for the APP, by dividing the base production by the biodiesel conversion factor of 1.4 and multiplying the result by 0.5 in FY 2003, 0.3 in FY 2004, 0.15 in FY 2005, or 0.0 (zero) in FY 2006 to determine base biodiesel production gross payable units.

      (3) Adding the APP and BPP to determine biodiesel gross payable units.

      (c) There shall only be one eligible producer per plant location.

      (1) When producers move production from one plant to another between FY's, the prior FY's production for the producer for program payment calculations tied to increases in production shall be the greater of:

      (i) The production at the plant operated by the producer in the prior FY, or

      (ii) The production in the prior FY at the plant being taken over by the producer in the current FY.

      (2) New producers who are taking over a plant with prior bioenergy production shall assume that production history for program purposes. For example: in FY 2002, Producer A produced 1,000 gallons of bioenergy in plant 1 and Producer B produced 500,000 of bioenergy in plant 2. In FY 2003, Producer A assumes operation of plant 2; Producer B moves to plant 3, which was not in the program in FY 2002, but with FY 2002 production of 400,000 gallons from eligible commodities; and Producer C assumes operations of plant 1. In FY 2003, for program purposes solely based on these respective plants, Producer A would have a prior FY production of 500,000 gallons; Producer B would have a prior FY production of 500,000 gallons; and Producer C would have a prior FY production of 1,000 gallons. These examples would apply when a producer moves its entire operation from one plant to another. Otherwise, for purposes of computing whether a producer has increased production in the current year from the previous year, the determination will be made by comparing for the current year the producer's production figures from all locations in which the producer has an interest with, for the previous year, the sum of:

      (i) Production at those locations by any person including, but not limited to, the producer, and

      (ii) Additional production by the producer at any other location in that year.

      (3) Also, as needed to avoid frustrating the goals of the program, the Executive Vice President of CCC may treat producers with common interests, common ownership, or common facilities or arrangements as the same producer.

      § 1424.8   Payment amounts.

#### § § 1424.8

      (a) An eligible producer may be paid the amount specified in this section, subject to the availability of funds. Total available funds shall be as determined appropriate by CCC and shall not exceed $150 million in any of FY's 2003 through 2006.

      (b) For agreements submitted during an FY sign-up, applicants must project increases in production. Based on expected commodity prices, using the formula set out in this section, submissions will be assigned an expected payment value. When the payment value of all timely submitted and validly executed agreements exceed available funding, CCC may, at its discretion, prorate payments to be made under such agreements based on total available funding.

      (c) When the payment value of all timely submitted applications exceed available funding, CCC will prorate payments based on total available funding.

      (d) Subject to this section and conditions in the agreement, a producer's payment eligibility shall be adjusted at the end of each quarter, and calculated as follows:

      (1) Gross payable units, calculated and determined in accordance with § 1424.7, shall be converted to net payable units for producers whose annual bioenergy production is:

      (i) Less than 65 million gallons, by dividing by 2.5;

      (ii) Equal to or more than 65 million gallons, by dividing by 3.5;

      (2) Net payable units calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall then be converted to a gross payment by multiplying net payable units by the per-unit value of the commodity as of the 10th business day before the start of the production quarter, determined as follows:

      (i) For ethanol:

      (A) For those agricultural commodities with an established Posted County Price, CCC will use the Posted County Price that CCC announces daily for the county in which the plant is located and applicable quality factors as CCC may establish.

      (B) For agricultural commodities that CCC determines do not have Posted County Prices, CCC will use market data CCC determines to be appropriate for the applicable commodity.

      (ii) For biodiesel made from:

      (A) Soybeans or soy oil, CCC will use the Posted County Price for soybeans for the county where the plant is located.

      (B) Eligible commodities other than soybeans or soy oil that have a corresponding oil or grease market price, CCC will first use the soybeans Posted County Price for Macon County, Illinois. Then, the applicable feedstock's oil or yellow grease (for animal fats and oils) market price, as determined by CCC, will be divided by the soy oil price published in the Agricultural Marketing Service's weekly “Soybean Crush Report” (Central Illinois (Decatur, Macon County, Illinois)) for the applicable date. The resulting percentage will be multiplied by the soybean gross payment to determine the producer's gross payment.

      (C) Eligible commodities that do not have a corresponding oil or grease market price, in a manner as determined by CCC.

      (3) The gross payment calculated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be reduced to a net payment by multiplying the gross payment figure by the proration factor determined under paragraph (c) of this section.

      (4) Subject to other provisions of this section, producers shall be paid the net current payment, if positive, determined for the quarter, subject to the requirements and refund provisions of this part.

      (5) After the first quarter, adjustments shall be made based on changes in production. Refunds, when due, shall be due at the per unit values at which they were paid.

      (6) For an FY, no producer may receive more than 5 percent of the available funding for this program.

      (e) When the commodity's conversion factor has been established, that factor will, as practicable, be posted on the program's website.

      (1) If the commodity's conversion factor is not determined when the sign-up is announced, the conversion factor will be provided in a letter to producers with accepted agreements to the extent practicable.

      (2) After FY 2003, changes to established conversion factors shall be announced in a press release issued by CCC 90 calendar days before the applicable FY's sign-up, to the extent practicable.

      § 1424.9   Reports required.

#### § § 1424.9

      Once an eligible producer has submitted a payment application, that producer shall file cumulative and per-plant information for each relevant bioenergy producing facility quarterly through the end of the applicable FY as specified by CCC or as otherwise needed to establish compliance with this part.

      § 1424.10   Succession and control of facilities and production.

#### § § 1424.10

      A person who obtains a facility that is under contract under this part may request permission to succeed to the program agreement and CCC may grant such request if it is determined that permitting such succession would serve the purposes of the program. If appropriate, CCC may require the consent of the original party to such succession. Also, CCC may terminate a contract and demand full refund of payments made if a contracting party loses control of a facility whose increased production is the basis of a program payment or otherwise fails to retain the ability to assure that all program obligations and requirements will be met.

      § 1424.11   Maintenance and inspection of records.

#### § § 1424.11

      For the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements of this part, each eligible producer shall make available at one place at all reasonable times for examination by representatives of USDA, all books, papers, records, contracts, scale tickets, settlement sheets, invoices, written price quotations, or other documents related to the program that is within the control of such entity for not less than three years from the payment date.

      § 1424.12   Appeals.

#### § § 1424.12

      (a) A participant subject to an adverse determination under this part may appeal by submitting a written request to: Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, STOP 0550, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20250-0550. The appeal must be delivered in writing to the Deputy Administrator or postmarked within 30 days after the date the Agency decision is mailed or otherwise provided to the participant. The Deputy Administrator may consider a late appeal if determined warranted by the circumstances.

      (b) The regulations at 7 CFR part 11 apply to decisions made under this part.

      (c) Producers who believe they have been adversely affected by a determination by the Agency must seek review with the Deputy Administrator before any other review may be requested within the Agency.

      § 1424.13   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1424.13

      (a) A producer shall be ineligible to receive payments under this program if CCC determines the producer:

      (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program in this part;

      (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

      (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

      (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to a producer engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, or to any other person as a result of the bioenergy producer's actions, shall be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due, plus damages as may be determined by CCC.

      (c) Any producer or person engaged in an act prohibited by this section and any producer or person receiving payment under this part shall be jointly and severally liable for any refund due under this part and for related charges.

      (d) The remedies provided in this part shall be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

      (e) Late payment interest shall be assessed on all refunds in accordance with the provisions and rates prescribed in part 1403 of this chapter.

      (b) Loans and, if applicable, LDP's will be available to CMA's for any eligible commodity in a loan pool as provided in paragraph (e) of this section and the beneficial interest provisions of parts 1421 and 1427 of this chapter.

      (c) A loan pool is eligible for MALs and LDPs if:

      (1) All of the commodity in the loan pool is eligible for MALs or LDPs, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;

      (2) The commodity was delivered by members to the CMA for their benefit;

      (3) The commodity was delivered and the members are eligible for MALs and LDPs;

      (4) Members retain the right to share in marketing proceeds from the commodity in accordance with § 1425.18; and

      (5) Members agreed to accept a payment of initial advances from the CMA in accordance with § 1425.18(a).

      (6) Members agree to refund to the CMA, if requested by the CMA, any denied market loan gain or LDP benefit realized when the proceeds from the loan pool are distributed to the CMA members.

      (d) Ineligible commodities may be included in eligible pools when:

      (1) The CMA inadvertently included ineligible quantities based on grade, quality, bale weight or repacking in the case of cotton, or other factors; or

      (2) There are eligibility discrepancies within FSA records, the producer has certified to the CMA that the commodity is eligible for a MAL, and there is no market gain or LDP involved in the loan pool for the crop year.

      (e) A CMA may include a commodity in a pool that is ineligible based on FSA records if the producer has certified to the CMA the commodity is eligible. (For example, an otherwise eligible commodity that is not reflected on a timely filed FSA acreage report.) CCC will specify a time period during which CMAs may obtain MALs or LDPs on the applicable quantity while the eligibility status is resolved. If the final resolution is that the commodity was ineligible, the CMA must repay any MALs outstanding with principal plus interest and any market loan gains obtained plus interest from the date of receiving the market loan gain through the repayment date.

      (f) The CMA must have in inventory a quantity of commodity delivered by members of each class and grade at least equal to the quantity each class and grade pledged as MAL collateral.

      (j) Commodities pledged as collateral for MALs must be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances based on a CMA's financial agreements or the CMA must obtain and complete a lien waiver form. When liens are applicable based on CMA financial agreements, the CMA must provide CCC the completed lien waiver form. CMAs must not take any action to cause a lien or encumbrance to be placed on a commodity after a MAL is approved.

      (k) If a MAL or LDP is obtained for any quantity in a loan pool, allocations of costs and expenses among separate pools for the commodity in the pool will be made according to generally accepted accounting principles.

      (l) A CMA must not apply marketing losses from a commodity not used to obtain a MAL or LDP against the marketing proceeds of a commodity used to obtain a MAL or LDP.

      (m) CMAs will not carry forward losses from one loan pool and apply them against a subsequent loan pool without CCC's authorization. CCC may grant authorization when it determines that carrying forward the loss complies with the MAL or LDP Program intent.

      (n) The CMA is responsible to CCC for any loss related to commodities the CMA pledged as collateral for MAL or used to obtain LDP related to:

      (1) The CMA failing to comply with these regulations;

      (2) Changes in quantity or quality of either warehouse or farm stored commodities; or

      (3) Liens based on either the CMA's or its members' financial agreements.

      (o) Denied market loan gain or denied LDP benefits will be based on payment limitation attribution as specified in part 1400 of this chapter, and must be repaid to CCC by the CMA receiving the MAL or LDP proceeds.

      (ii) Less any authorized charges for services performed or paid by the CMA necessary to condition or otherwise make the commodity eligible for MALs or LDPs, according to the marketing agreement provided for in § 1425.13;

      (iii) Within 15 work days from the date the CMA receives MAL or LDP proceeds from CCC, or held according to the terms of a deferred payment agreement if requested by the member.

      (2) CMA's may credit advances to its members made before loans and LDP's are obtained against the distribution of MAL and LDP proceeds requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

      (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, loan pool proceeds must not be combined with non-loan pool proceeds and the CMA must distribute loan pool proceeds according to the information it provided CCC in accordance with § 1425.4(a)(5).

      (3) MAL and LDP proceeds shall only be issued to members involved in pools used for MALs or LDP's.

      (4) When notified by CCC that MAL and LDP distributions to a member are required to be reduced for a program year, farm, or crop, a CMA must not make subsequent pool distributions and must reimburse CCC for distributions previously issued, if applicable.

      (c) CMAs must apply market loan gains to the payment limit that is earned on date of redemption for their members when the CMA distributes the pool funds.

The production of the receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee is considered to be the production of the person or estate represented by the receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trust. Loan and loan deficiency payment documents executed by any such person will be accepted by CCC only if they are legally valid and such person has the authority to sign the applicable documents.

        (c) A minor who is otherwise an eligible producer shall be eligible to receive loans and loan deficiency payments only if the minor meets one of the following requirements:

        (1) The right of majority has been conferred on the minor by court proceedings or by statute;

        § 1427.5   General eligibility requirements.

#### § § 1427.5

        (a) To receive loans or LDPs for a crop of cotton, a producer must execute a note and security agreement or LDP application on or before May 31 of the year following the year in which such crop is normally harvested.

        (1) Form A loan documents or LDP applications must be signed by the applicant and submitted to CCC or a loan servicing agent. Submissions by cotton clerks must occur within 15 calendar days after the producer signs the forms and within the period of loan availability. A producer, except for a CMA, must request loans and LDPs:

        (i) At the FSA county office that is responsible under part 718 of this title for administering programs for the farm on which the cotton was produced; or

        (ii) From a loan servicing agent.

        (2) Form G loan documents and requests for LDPs by a CMA must be signed by the CMA and delivered to CCC or the cotton commercial bank within the period of loan availability.

        (b) For a bale of cotton to be eligible to be pledged as collateral for a MAL or a subject of an LDP application, the bale must:

        (1) Be tendered to CCC by an eligible producer;

        (2) Be in existence and good condition and be covered by fire insurance. Bales pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, must be stored inside an approved storage warehouse unless, as determined under § 1427.10, CCC has approved the warehouse to use outside storage for cotton loan collateral for the period of the loan. Bales submitted to CCC for an LDP are not subject to the approved storage requirements contained in § 1423.10.

        (3) Be represented by a warehouse receipt meeting the requirements of § 1427.11, except as provided in §§ 1427.10(e) and 1427.23(a)(4);

        (4) Not be false-packed, wet cotton, water-packed, mixed-packed, re-ginned, or repacked;

        (5) Not be compressed to universal density at a warehouse where side pressure has been applied and not be a flat or modified flat bale;

        (6) Not have been sold, nor any sales option on such cotton granted, to a buyer under a contract which provides that the buyer may direct the producer to pledge the cotton to CCC as collateral for a loan or to obtain an LDP ;

        (7) Not have been previously sold and repurchased or pledged as collateral for a CCC loan and redeemed except as provided in § 1427.172(b)(4);

        (8) Not be cotton for which an LDP has been previously made;

        (9) Weigh at least 325 pounds net weight; bales of more than 600 pounds net weight may be pledged for loan at 600 pounds net weight.

        (10) Be packaged in materials that meet the specifications adopted by the Joint Cotton Industry Bale Packaging Committee sponsored by the National Cotton Council of America for the applicable year or that are identified and approved by the Joint Industry Bale Packaging Committee as experimental packaging materials for the applicable crop year, except that producers approved for the outside storage of ELS cotton as provided for in § 1427.10(e) must assure that the packaging materials used for bales stored outside must meet the materials, sealing, and humidity specifications contained in the outside-storage addendum to their ELS cotton MAL agreement.

        (11) Be ginned by a ginner that:

        (i) Has entered the tare weight of the bale (bagging and ties used to wrap the bale) on the gin bale tag or otherwise furnish warehouse operator the tare weight; and

        (ii) Has entered into a Cooperating Ginners' Bagging and Bale Ties Certification and Agreement on a form prescribed by CCC, or certified that the bale is wrapped with bagging and bale ties meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(10) of this section and;

        (12) Be production from acreage that has been reported timely under part 718 of this title.

        (c) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, for ELS cotton the bale must:

        (1) Be of a grade, strength, staple length, and other factors specified in the schedule of loan rates for ELS cotton;

        (2) Have a micronaire specified in the schedule of micronaire premiums and discounts for ELS cotton; and

        (3) Have an extraneous matter specified in the schedules of premiums and discounts for extraneous matter for ELS cotton.

        (d) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, for upland cotton the bale must:

        (1) Have been graded by using a High Volume Instrument;

        (2) Be a grade, staple length, and leaf specified in the schedule of premiums and discounts for grade, staple, and leaf for upland cotton;

        (3) Have a strength reading specified in the schedule of strength premiums and discounts for upland cotton;

        (4) Have a micronaire specified in the schedule of micronaire premiums and discounts for upland cotton;

        (5) Have an extraneous matter within the limits specified in the schedule of discounts for extraneous matter for upland cotton; and

        (6) Have a uniformity specified in the schedule of uniformity premiums and discounts for upland cotton.

        (e) To be eligible to receive MALs and LDPs, a producer must have beneficial interest in the cotton that is tendered to CCC for a MAL or LDP. For the purposes of this part, the term “beneficial interest” refers to a determination by CCC that a person has the requisite title to and control of cotton that is tendered to CCC as collateral for a MAL or is the cotton that will be used to determine an LDP. A determination of whether a person has beneficial interest in cotton is made by CCC in accordance with this part and is not based upon a determination under any State law or any other regulation of a Federal agency.

        (f) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, when requesting a MAL, in order to have beneficial interest in the cotton tendered as collateral for the loan, a person must:

        (1) Be the producer of the cotton as determined in accordance with § 1427.4;

        (2) Have had ownership of the cotton from the time it was planted through the earlier the date the loan was repaid or the maturity date of the loan;

        (3) Have control of the cotton from the time of planting through the maturity date of the loan. To have control of the cotton, such person must have complete decision making authority regarding whether the cotton will be tendered as collateral for a loan, when the loan will be repaid or if the collateral will be forfeited to CCC in satisfaction of the loan obligations of such person, and where the cotton will be maintained during the term of the loan; and

        (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, when requesting an LDP, in order to have beneficial interest in the cotton a person must:

        (1) Be the producer of the cotton as determined in accordance with § 1427.4;

        (2) Have had ownership of the cotton from the time it was planted through the date the producer has elected to determine the LDP rate; and

        (3) Have control of the cotton from the time of planting through the date the producer has elected to determine the LDP rate. To have control of the cotton, such person must have complete decision making authority regarding whether an LDP will be requested with respect to the cotton; when the loan deficiency rate will be selected; and where the cotton will be maintained prior to the date on which the LDP rate will be determined;

        (4) If the cotton has been physically delivered to a location other than a location owned or under the total control of the producer, have delivered the cotton to a warehouse approved in accordance with § 1427.10. Delivery of the cotton to a location other than to such an approved warehouse will result in the loss of beneficial interest in the cotton on the date of physical delivery and the producer will be considered to have lost beneficial interest as of 11:59 p.m. of such day regardless of any other action or agreement between the entity where the cotton was delivered and the producer, unless such an entity has been approved by CCC under § 1427.10.

        (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, in order to facilitate the handling of situations involving the death of a producer, CCC will consider an estate and a person to whom title to cotton has passed by virtue of State law upon the death of the producer to have beneficial interest in the cotton produced by the producer under the same terms and conditions that would otherwise be applicable to such producer;

        (i) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a person who purchases or otherwise acquires cotton from a producer under any circumstances does not obtain beneficial interest to the cotton whether such purchase or acquisition is made prior to the harvest of the crop or after harvest except in one instance. CCC will consider a person to have beneficial interest in cotton if, prior to harvest, such person has obtained title to the growing cotton at the same time that such person obtained full title to the land on which such crop was growing;

        (j) A producer will lose beneficial interest in cotton if the producer receives any payment from any person under any contractual arrangement with respect to cotton if the person who is making the payment, or any person otherwise associated with the person making the payment, will at any time have title to the cotton or control of the cotton prior to or after harvest unless:

        (1) Such payment is authorized in accordance with part 1425 of this chapter; or

        (2) The payment is made as consideration for an option to purchase the cotton and such option contains the following provision:

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this option to purchase or any other contract, title and control of the cotton and beneficial interest in the cotton as specified in 7 CFR 1427.5 will remain with the producer until the buyer exercises this option to purchase the cotton. This option to purchase will expire, notwithstanding any action or inaction by either the producer or the buyer, at the earlier of:

        

        

        

        (k) Absent other provisions causing the producer to lose beneficial interest in the cotton, inclusion in a contract of a provision that allows the producer to select the sales price of the cotton at the time the contract is entered into or at a later date, a contract normally referred to as a deferred price contract or a price later contract, will not result in the loss of beneficial interest in the cotton.

        (l) Commodities produced under a contract in which the title to the seed remains with the entity providing the seed to the producer, including contracts for the production of hybrid seed, genetically modified commodities, and other specialty seeds as approved in writing by CCC, are eligible to be pledged as collateral for a MAL and an LDP may be made with respect to such production if at the time of the request for such a loan or payment the producer has not:

        (1) Received a payment under the contract; or

        (2) Delivered the commodity to another person.

        (m) Each bale of upland cotton sampled by the warehouse operator upon initial receipt which has not been sampled by the ginner must not show more than one sample hole on each side of the bale. If more than one sample is desired when the bale is received by the warehouse operator, the sample will be cut across the width of the bale, broken in half or split lengthwise, and otherwise drawn under Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) dimension and weight requirements. This requirement will not prohibit sampling of the cotton at a later date if authorized by the producer.

        (n) If MALs or LDPs are made available to producers through a CMA under part 1425 of this chapter, the beneficial interest in the cotton must always have been held by the producer-member who delivered the cotton to the CMA or its member, except as otherwise provided in this section. Cotton delivered to such a CMA will not be eligible to receive a MAL or an LDP if the producer-member who delivered the cotton does not retain the right to share in the proceeds from the marketing of the cotton as provided in part 1425 of this chapter.

        (b) If the loan is not repaid by the loan maturity date, title to the cotton will vest in CCC the day after such maturity date and CCC will have no obligation to pay for any market value which such cotton may have in excess of the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.

        (c) Following written notice by CCC to the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may advance the maturity date of cotton pledged as collateral for a MAL if:

        (1) CCC determines such loan cotton collateral is improperly warehoused and subject to damage,

        (2) Any term of the producer's loan agreement is violated, or

        (3) Carrying charges are substantially in excess of the average of carrying charges available elsewhere and the storing warehouse, after notice, declines to reduce such charges.

#### § § 1427.8

        (a) The loan rates for crops of upland cotton and ELS cotton will be determined and announced by CCC and made available at FSA State and county offices.

        (b) The quantity of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a loan will be the net weight of the eligible cotton as shown on the warehouse receipt issued by an approved warehouse, except that in the case of a bale which has a net weight of more than 600 pounds, the weight to be used in determining the amount of the loan on the bale will be 600 pounds. Cotton pledged as collateral for loans on the basis of reweights will not be accepted by CCC.

        (c) The amount of the loan for each bale will be determined by multiplying the net weight of the bale, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section by the applicable loan rate.

        (d) CCC will not increase the amount of the loan made for any bale of cotton as a result of a redetermination of the quantity or quality of the bale after it is tendered to CCC, except that if it is established to the satisfaction of CCC that a bona fide error was made for the weight of the bale or the classification for the bale, such error may be corrected.

        (c) If the producer's cotton has not been classed or sampled in a manner acceptable by CCC, the warehouse must sample such cotton and forward the samples to the AMS Cotton Classing Office or other entity approved by AMS. Such warehouse must be licensed by AMS or be approved by CCC to draw samples for submission to the AMS Cotton Classing Office.

        (d) If a sample has been submitted for classification, another sample will not be drawn, except for a review classification.

        (e) Where review classification is not involved:

        (1) If through error or otherwise two or more samples from the same bale are submitted for classification, the loan rate will be based on the classification having the lower loan value;

        (2) CCC will use classification information received directly from AMS rather than AMS classification information received from the producer.

        (f) CCC will base any cotton loan rate or loan deficiency payment rate on the most recent classification information available before the loan or loan deficiency payment has been calculated. CCC will not adjust such rates based on review classification information submitted subsequent to the original benefit calculation.

#### § § 1427.10

        (a) Eligible cotton may be pledged as collateral for loans only if stored at warehouses approved by CCC, unless the producer agrees to provisions of 1427.5(n).

#### § § 1427.11

        (a) Producers may obtain loans on eligible cotton represented by electronic warehouse receipts only if the warehouse receipts meet the definition of a warehouse receipt and provide for delivery of the cotton to bearer or are properly assigned by endorsement in blank, so as to vest title in the holder of the receipt or are otherwise acceptable to CCC. The warehouse receipt must:

        (1) Contain the gin bale number;

        (2) Contain the warehouse receipt number;

        (3) Be dated on or before the date the producer signs the note and security agreement.

        (b) Warehouse receipts, under § 1427.3, when issued as block warehouse receipts will be accepted when authorized by CCC only if the owner of the warehouse issuing the block warehouse receipt owns the cotton represented by the block warehouse receipt and the warehouse is not licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.

        (c)(1) Each receipt must set out in its terms the tare and the net weight of the bale represented by the receipt. The net weight shown on the warehouse receipt must be the difference between the gross weight as determined by the warehouse at the warehouse site and the tare weight. The warehouse receipt may show the net weight established at a gin if gin weights are permitted by the licensing authority for the warehouse.

        (2) The tare weight shown on the receipt must be the tare weight furnished to the warehouse by the ginner or entered by the ginner on the gin bale tag. A machine card type warehouse receipt reflecting an alteration in gross, tare weight, or net weight will not be accepted by CCC unless it bears, on the face of the receipt, the following legend or similar wording approved by CCC, duly executed by the warehouse or an authorized representative of the warehouse:

        (3) Alterations in other inserted data on a machine card type warehouse receipt must be initialed by an authorized representative of the warehouse.

        (d) If warehouse storage charges have been paid, the receipt must show that date through which the storage charges have been paid.

        (e) If warehouse receiving charges have been paid or waived, the warehouse receipt must show such fact.

        (f) The warehouse receipt must show the compression status of the bale;  flat, modified flat, standard, gin standard, standard density (short), gin universal, universal density (short), or warehouse universal density. The receipt must show if the compression charge has been paid, or if the warehouse claims no lien for such compression.

#### § § 1427.12

        (a) Waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC must be obtained before loan disbursement, notwithstanding provisions in § 1427.19(h), if there are any liens or encumbrances on the cotton tendered as collateral for a loan, even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds, except that CCC may elect to waive such lien requirements for loans having a principal value of less than $50,000.

        (b) CCC may elect to accept cotton as loan collateral that has warehouse receiving, compression, or other charges without a lien waiver if the producer at the time of loan application agrees to reimburse CCC for any such charges that CCC may pay on behalf of the producer or that reduce the value of the cotton delivered to CCC.

#### § § 1427.13

        (a) A producer must pay a nonrefundable loan service fee to CCC at the time of loan disbursement or, if applicable, to a loan servicing agent, at a rate determined by CCC.

        § 1427.17   [Reserved]

#### § § 1427.17

        § 1427.18   Liability of the producer.

#### § § 1427.18

        (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a MAL or LDP or in maintaining or settling a loan, or disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the prior written approval of CCC, such loan or LDP will be payable upon demand by CCC. The producer will be liable for:

        (i) The amount of the MAL or LDP;

        (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan or LDP;

        (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of the loan collateral;

        (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts;

        (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (vi) About amounts due for a loan, the payment of such amounts may not be satisfied by the forfeiture of loan collateral to CCC of cotton with a settlement value that is less than the total of such amounts or by repayment of such loan at the lower loan repayment rate as prescribed in § 1427.19.

        (vii) CCC will not assume any loss pertaining to cotton stored in a warehouse for any reason.

        (2) If a producer makes a fraudulent representation or if the producer has disposed of, or moved the loan collateral without prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral will be equal to its loan value, plus accrued interest, plus warehouse charges, and liquidated damages, as determined by CCC.

        (b) If the amount disbursed under a MAL, or in settlement thereof, or LDP exceeds the amount authorized by this subpart, the producer will be liable for repayment of the difference, plus interest. In addition, the commodity pledged as collateral for the loan will not be released to the producer until the difference is repaid.

        (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the MAL or LDP is less than the amount required under this subpart, the producer will be personally liable for repayment of the amount of the difference plus applicable interest.

        (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement or LDP application with CCC, each producer is jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement or LDP application and this subpart. Each producer also remains liable for repayment of the entire loan or LDP amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to their share in the cotton pledged as collateral for the loan or for which the LDP was made. In addition, the producer may not amend the note and security agreement or LDP application for the producer's claimed share in the cotton after execution of the note and security agreement or LDP application by CCC.

        (e) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC if a producer makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan or LDP, in maintaining or settling a loan, or disposing of or moving the loan collateral without the prior written approval of CCC. Accordingly, if CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of their requests for a loan or any applicable form required by CCC, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity involved in the violation. Liquidated damages assessed in accordance with this section will be determined by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the MAL rate applicable to the loan note.

        (f) When it has been determined that a violation of the terms and conditions of a loan deficiency application has occurred, CCC will determine the quantity of the cotton involved with respect to such violation and assess liquidated damages by multiplying the quantity of cotton involved in the violation by 10 percent of the MAL rate.

        (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense for which CCC cannot determine good faith when the violation occurred, CCC will:

        (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (2) Call the applicable MAL involved in the violation and require repayment of any market loan gain previously realized for the applicable loan, plus any interest previously waived and any storage paid by CCC, and for an LDP, require repayment of the LDP and charges plus interest from the date the LDP was made.

        (h) If the county committee acting on behalf of CCC determines that the producer has committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this section, CCC will notify the producer in writing that:

        (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and information regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, to the county committee; and

        (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraph (f) or (g) of this section.

        (i) If CCC accelerates the maturity date for a loan under this section, the producer must repay the loan at principal and charges, plus interest and may not repay the loan at the lower of the loan repayment rate under § 1427.19 or utilize the provisions of part 1401 of this chapter for such loan.

        (j) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (e) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.

        (k)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, for ELS cotton stored as provided in § 1427.10(f), the producer is liable for all costs associated with the storage of the cotton while it is stored outside. CCC will make no storage payment or any other payment with respect to ELS cotton stored as provided in § 1427.10(f).

        (2) The producer of ELS cotton that is stored as provided in § 1427.10(f) must:

        (i) Certify the quantity of such cotton on the loan application; certify the cotton is packaged in a hermetically sealed bag with an internal humidity level established by the gin as appropriate to safeguard the cotton; certify that packaging materials meet or exceed industry minimum standards; certify that the storage area is suitable for cotton storage and is in an area approved by CCC; certify that the storage area is constructed to prevent water accumulation under the cotton and is outside a 100-year floodplain; and certify that the storage area is serviced by bale handling and transport equipment that will not damage the sealed bag or degrade the storage area;

        (ii) Be responsible for any loss in quantity or quality of such cotton;

        (iii) If the loan is satisfied by forfeiting the cotton to CCC, be responsible for all costs associated with delivering such cotton to a warehouse designated by CCC, all costs associated with any re-classification and repackaging that may be required by CCC or the warehouse operator to whom the cotton is delivered, all charges by the receiving warehouse for receiving the cotton and issuing an electronic warehouse receipt for the cotton, and other charges as may be levied by the warehouse specific to outside-stored cotton; and

        (iv) Not move such cotton after the loan application is submitted to CCC without prior written approval of the county committee. Failure of the producer to receive such permission will subject the producer to administrative actions.

        (a) Warehouse receipts pledged as collateral for a CCC loan will not be released except as provided in this section.

        (b) A producer, an authorized agent or anyone subsequently designated by the producer in the manner prescribed by CCC may redeem one or more bales of cotton pledged as collateral for a loan by payment to CCC of an amount applicable to the bales of cotton being redeemed determined under this section. CCC, upon proper payment for the amount due, will release the warehouse receipts applicable to such cotton.

        (c) A producer or agent or subsequent agent authorized in writing in a manner prescribed by CCC may repay the loan amount for one or more bales of cotton pledged as collateral for a MAL:

        (1) For upland cotton, at a level that is the lesser of:

        (i) The loan level and charges, plus interest determined for such bales; or

        (ii) The adjusted world price, as determined by CCC under § 1427.25, in effect on the day the repayment is received by the FSA county office, loan servicing agent, or cotton commercial bank that disbursed the loan.

        (2) For ELS cotton, by repaying the loan amount and charges, plus interest determined for such bales.

        (d) CCC will determine and publicly announce the adjusted world price for each crop of upland cotton on a weekly basis.

        (e) The difference between the loan level, excluding charges and interest, and the loan repayment level is the market loan gain. The total amount of any market loan gain realized by a person is subject to part 1400 of this chapter.

        (f) Repayment of loans will not be accepted after CCC acquires title to the cotton under § 1427.7.

        (g) In the event that Thursday is a non-workday, such loan repayments will not be accepted beginning at 7 a.m. Eastern Standard time the next workday until an announcement of the adjusted world price for the succeeding weekly period has been made under § 1427.25(e).

        (h) For purposes of calculating loan-period accrued storage charges that CCC may credit to the loan repayment amount under paragraph (i) of this section:

        (1) The warehouse storage rates for cotton crops under loan will be the lower of:

        (i) The tariff storage rate for the warehouse for the 2005 crop or, for any warehouse not in existence in 2005, a CCC-assigned average 2005 crop tariff rate for the county or area; or

        (ii) The storage rate for 2006 crop cotton reduced by 10 percent.

        (2) CCC will not credit the loan repayment amount for a bale for any storage charges that accrued while the cotton was stored outside, except that storage may be credited for up to 15-days of outside storage beginning on the day the warehouse was notified that the bale is under loan if the bale was inside on the 15th day from the date of notification.

        (3) The loan period will be determined by CCC to begin:

        (i) For loan disbursed by the FSA, on the date all loan documents, as determined and announced by CCC, have been received or

        (ii) For a loan disbursed by a CMA or an authorized loan servicing agent, on the date the loan was disbursed by CCC.

        (i)(1) An upland cotton loan repayment rate will not exceed the loan principal plus accrued interest for the period provided in § 1427.19(j).

        (2) When the prevailing adjusted world price of upland cotton, as determined under § 1427.25, is less than the combined value of the loan principal, accrued interest, and warehouse storage that accrued during the period of the loan, CCC will permit the loan to be repaid at the adjusted world price less the storage charges that accrued during the period of the loan.

        (j) For purposes of calculating interest charges on upland and extra long staple cotton loan principal, the loan period will be the period starting the date after the disbursement of the loan amount to, and including, the loan repayment date, except that interest is not charged for a loan that is disbursed and repaid on the same date.

        (k) Repayment of loans will not be accepted after CCC acquires title to the cotton in accordance with § 1427.7.

        (l) A producer who receives a market loan gain or LDP and later is determined to have been ineligible must refund the market loan gain or LDP to CCC.

        § 1427.21   Settlement.

#### § § 1427.21

        (a) The settlement of cotton loans will be made by CCC on the basis of the quality and quantity of the cotton delivered to CCC by the producer or acquired by CCC subject to the producer being responsible for, if applicable, warehouse receiving charges, new bale ties, unpaid warehouse compression, charges for and related to the certification of a bale and for any subsequent exchange of certificated receipts, storage charges for any period of yard storage, and storage charges in excess of any maximum storage credit rates as determined and announced by CCC.

        (b) For purposes of settlements for cotton delivered to CCC in satisfaction of a loan obligation, CCC may elect to calculate such settlement values based on the net weight, condition, and classification as reflected on the warehouse receipt delivered to CCC, whether such receipt is the receipt issued by the original storing warehouse and presented for calculating the loan amount or a receipt issued by a subsequent warehouse due to the transfer of such bale while pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.

        (c) If a producer does not pay CCC the amount due under a loan, CCC will take title to the cotton as provided in § 1427.7(b).

        (d) With respect to ELS cotton which is stored as provided in § 1427.10(f), settlement of loans will be made based upon the determination of the quantity and quality made by CCC at the time of acceptance of the cotton by CCC at the warehouse designated by CCC as provided in § 1427.18(k).

        (e) If CCC sells the commodity described in paragraph (a) of this section in settlement of the recourse loan, the sales proceeds will be applied to the amount owed CCC by the producer. The producer is responsible for any costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale and CCC will deduct the amount of these costs from the sales proceeds. When CCC sells any cotton obtained by forfeiture under a MAL, CCC will, in all instances, retain all proceeds obtained from the sale of the cotton and will not make any payment of any amount of such proceeds to any party, including the producer who had satisfied their obligation under the loan through forfeiture of the cotton to CCC.

        (f) CCC will pay to the warehouse any unpaid storage or receiving charges for forfeited loan collateral, not to exceed the amount that accrued from the date that all necessary documents were received by CCC to the loan maturity date, as soon as practicable after the cotton is forfeited.

        § 1427.23   Cotton LDPs.

#### § § 1427.23

        (a) In order to be eligible to receive such LDPs the producer of the upland cotton must:

        (1) Comply with all of the upland cotton MAL eligibility requirements under this subpart;

        (2) Agree to forgo obtaining such loans unless denied an LDP due to payment limitation;

        (3) Submit, on a form prescribed by CCC, to the FSA county office on or before beneficial interest is lost in such quantity and before the final loan availability date for the commodity:

        (i) An indication of their intentions to receive an LDP on the identified commodity or

        (ii) A completed request for an LDP for a quantity of eligible cotton under § 1427.5(a).

        (4) Provide warehouse receipts or, as determined by CCC, a list of gin bale numbers for such cotton showing, for each bale, the net weight established at the gin;

        (5) For LDPs requested before ginning of the cotton based on a locked-in adjusted world price, provide identifying numbers for modules or other storage units that will correspond to the gin-assigned numbers of the bales produced from the unginned cotton; and

        (6) Otherwise comply with all program requirements.

        (b) The LDP applicable to a crop of cotton will be computed by multiplying the applicable LDP rate, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, by the quantity of the crop the producer is eligible to pledge as collateral for a loan, excluding any quantity for which the producer obtains a MAL.

        (c) The LDP rate for a crop of upland cotton will be the amount by which the loan rate determined for a bale of such crop exceeds the adjusted world price, as determined by CCC under § 1427.25, in effect on the day the request is received by the FSA county office, loan servicing agent, or cotton commercial bank. In no case will the LDP rate for a bale exceed the value of the bale had it been pledged as collateral for a MAL.

        (d) The total amount of any LDPs that a person may receive is subject to AGI provisions specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        (e) If the producer enters into an agreement with CCC on or before the date of ginning a quantity of eligible upland cotton, and the producer has the beneficial interest in such quantity as specified under § 1427.5(c) on the date the cotton was ginned, and the producer meets all the other requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on or before the final date to apply for an LDP under § 1427.5, the LDP rate applicable to such cotton will be:

        (1) Based on the date the cotton was ginned, which CCC will consider to be the date of the LDP request, if payment application is made in the manner prescribed by CCC for obtaining such rate;

        (2) Based on the date of request for lock-in of the adjusted world price if payment application is made in the manner prescribed by CCC for obtaining such rate; or

        (3) Based on the date a completed request including production evidence is submitted in the manner prescribed by CCC for obtaining such rate.

        (f) In the event that Thursday is a non-workday, such applications for loan deficiency payments will not be accepted beginning at 7 a.m. Eastern time the next workday until an announcement of the adjusted world price for the succeeding weekly period has been made under § 1427.25(e).

        § 1427.24   [Reserved]

#### § § 1427.24

        § 1427.25   Determination of the prevailing world market price and the adjusted world price for upland cotton.

#### § § 1427.25

        (a) CCC will determine the world market price for upland cotton as follows:

        (1) During the period when only one daily price quotation is available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-second inch (M 1 -inch) cotton, CFR (cost and freight) Far East, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton will be based on the average of the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1 -inch cotton, CFR Far East.

        (2) During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year (current Far East shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for shipment no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year (forward Far East shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M 1 -inch cotton, CFR Far East, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton will be based on the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1 -inch cotton, CFR Far East, except as may be determined by the Secretary as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.

        (3) The upland cotton prevailing world market price determined as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is referred to as the “Far East price” (FE).

        (4) If quotes are not available for 1 or more days in the 5-day period, the available quotes during the period will be used. If no quotes are available during the Friday through Thursday period, the prevailing world market price will be based on the best available world price information, as CCC determines.

        (b) The upland cotton prevailing world market price, adjusted as specified in paragraph (c) of this section (adjusted world price (AWP)), will apply to crops of upland cotton.

        (c) The upland cotton AWP will equal the FE determined as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, adjusted as follows:

        (1) FE will be adjusted to U.S. location by deducting the average costs to market, including average transportation costs, as determined by the Secretary.

        (2) The price determined as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the price of base quality upland cotton by deducting the difference, as CCC announces, between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1 -inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for base quality SLM 1 -inch, leaf 4 cotton.

        (3) The prevailing world market price, adjusted as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, may be further adjusted if it is determined that the adjustment is necessary to:

        (i) Minimize potential loan forfeitures;

        (ii) Minimize the accumulation of stocks of upland cotton by the Federal Government;

        (iii) Ensure that upland cotton produced in the United States can be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally; and

        (iv) Ensure an appropriate transition between current-crop and forward-crop price quotations, except that forward-crop price quotations may be used prior to July 31 of a marketing year only if there are insufficient current crop quotations and the forward-crop price quotation is the lowest such quotation available.

        (d) The upland cotton AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the amount of the additional adjustment determined as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, will be announced, to the extent practicable, at 4 p.m. eastern time each Thursday. In the event that Thursday is a non-workday, the determination will be announced, to the extent practicable, at 8 a.m. eastern time the next work day.

        (e)(1)(i) AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to a further coarse count adjustment as provided in this section regarding all qualities of upland cotton eligible for loan except the following upland cotton grades with a staple length of 1 -inch or longer:

        (A) White Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; and Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5;

        (B) Light Spotted Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 5; Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5; and Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 4; and

        (C) Spotted Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 2; and

        (ii) Grade, leaf, and staple length must be determined as specified in § 1427.9. If no such official classification is presented, the coarse count adjustment will not be made.

        (2) The adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be determined by deducting from AWP:

        (i) The difference between FE, and

        (A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each growth quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East, is available, the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East coarse count price); or

        (B) During the period when both current Far East shipment prices and forward Far East shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East, the result calculated by the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East coarse count price) minus

        (ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1 -inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality SLM 1 -inch, leaf 4 cotton.

        (3) Regarding the determination of the Far East coarse count price specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section:

        (i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day period, the available quotes will be used;

        (ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in the 5-day period, that day will not be considered; and

        (iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which case the adjustment determined as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.

        (f)(1)(i) AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to a further fine count adjustment as provided in this section regarding all upland cotton having a loan schedule premium or discount exceeding that for Middling, leaf 3, staple length 1 -inch upland cotton, and

        (ii) Grade, staple length, and leaf must be determined as specified in § 1427.9. If no such official classification is presented, the fine count adjustment will not be made.

        (2) The adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be determined by deducting from AWP:

        (i) The difference between FE, and

        (A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each growth quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East, is available the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East fine count price) or

        (B) During the period when both current Far East shipment prices and forward Far East shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East, the result calculated by the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East fine count price) minus

        (ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1 -inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality SM 1 -inch, leaf 2 cotton.

        (3) Regarding the determination of the Far East fine count price under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section:

        (i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day period, the available quotes will be used;

        (ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in the 5-day period, that day will not be considered; and

        (iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which case the adjustment determined as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.

        (g) In the determination of FE as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Far East coarse count price specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, and the Far East fine count price as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CCC will use either current Far East shipment prices, forward Far East shipment prices, or any combination thereof to determine FE or the Far East coarse count price or the Far East fine count price used in the determination of the adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f)(1) of this section and determined as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (f)(2) of this section to prevent distortions in such adjustment.

        (h) For particular bales, the AWP determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to further adjustments to a value no less than zero, as CCC determines, based on the Schedule of Premiums and Discounts as announced for the loan program for an upland cotton crop.

        § 1427.170   Quantity for loan.

#### § § 1427.170

        (a) The quantity of lint cotton in each lot of seed cotton tendered for loan will be determined by the FSA county office by multiplying the weight or estimated weight of seed cotton by the lint turnout factor determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) The lint turnout factor for any lot of seed cotton will be the percentage determined by the county committee representative during the initial inspection of the lot. If a control portion of the lot is weighed and ginned, the turnout factor determined for the portion of cotton ginned will be used for the lot. If a control portion is not weighed and ginned, the lint turnout factor will not exceed 32 percent for machine-picked cotton and 22 percent for machine-stripped cotton unless acceptable proof is furnished showing that the lint turnout factor is greater.

        (c) Loans will not be made on more than a percentage established by the county committee of the quantity of lint cotton determined as provided in this section. If the seed cotton is weighed, the percentage to be used will not be more than 95 percent. If the quantity is determined by measurement, the percentage to be used will not be more than 90 percent. The percentage to be used in determining the maximum quantity for any loan may be reduced below such percentages by the county committee when determined necessary to protect the interests of CCC on the basis of one or more of the following risk factors:

        (1) Condition or suitability of the storage site or structure;

        (2) Condition of the cotton;

        (3) Location of the storage site or structure; and

        (4) Other factors peculiar to individual farms or producers which related to the preservation or safety of the loan collateral. Loans may be made on a lower percentage basis at the producer's request.

#### § § 1427.171

        Approved storage consists of storage located on or off the producer's farm (excluding public warehouses) that is determined by a county committee representative to afford adequate protection against loss or damage and is located within a reasonable distance, as determined by CCC, from an approved gin. If the cotton is not stored on the producer's farm, the producer must furnish satisfactory evidence that the producer has the authority to store the cotton on such property and that the owner of the property has no lien for such storage against the cotton. The producer must provide satisfactory evidence that the producer and any person having an interest in the cotton including CCC, have the right to enter the premises to inspect and examine the cotton and permit a reasonable time to such persons to remove the cotton from the premises.

        § 1427.172   Settlement.

#### § § 1427.172

        (a) A producer may, at any time before maturity of the loan, obtain release of all or any part of the loan seed cotton by paying to CCC the amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.

        (b)(1) A producer or the producer's agent must not remove from storage any cotton that is pledged as collateral for a loan until prior written approval has been received from CCC for removal of the cotton. If a producer or the producer's agent obtains CCC approval, they may remove the cotton from storage, sell the seed cotton, have it ginned, and sell the resulting lint cotton and cottonseed. The ginner must inform the FSA county office in writing immediately after the seed cotton removed from storage has been ginned and furnish the county office the loan number, producer's name, and applicable gin bale numbers. If the seed cotton is removed from storage, the loan principal plus interest and charges must be paid not later than the earlier of:

        (i) The date established by the county committee;

        (ii) 5 days after the date of the producer received the AMS classification under § 1427.9 (and the warehouse receipt, if the cotton is delivered to a warehouse), representing such cotton; or

        (iii) The loan maturity date.

        (2) If the seed cotton or lint cotton is sold, the loan principal, interest, and charges must be satisfied immediately.

        (3) A producer, except a CMA, may obtain a nonrecourse loan or LDP under subpart A of this part, on the lint cotton, but:

        (i) The loan principal, interest, and charges on the seed cotton must be satisfied from the proceeds of the nonrecourse loan under subpart A of this part; or

        (ii) The LDP must be applied to the loan principal, interest, and charges on the outstanding seed cotton loan.

        (4) A CMA must repay the seed cotton loan principal, interest, and charges before pledging the cotton for a nonrecourse loan or before an LDP can be approved under subpart A of this part, on the lint cotton. If a CMA, which is authorized by producers to obtain loans in their behalf, removes seed cotton from storage before obtaining approval to move the cotton, the removal will constitute conversion of the cotton unless the CMA:

        (i) Notifies the FSA county office in writing the following morning by mail or otherwise that such cotton has been moved and is on the gin yard;

        (ii) Furnishes CCC an irrevocable letter of credit if requested; and

        (iii) Repays the loan principal, plus interest and charges, within the time specified by the county committee.

        (5) Any removal from storage will not be deemed to constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the seed cotton or to release the producer or CMA from liability for the loan principal, interest, and charges if full payment of such amount is not received by the FSA county office.

        (c) If, either before or after maturity, the producer discovers that the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of condition, the producer must immediately notify the FSA county office and confirm such notice in writing. If the county committee determines that the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of condition, the county committee will accelerate the maturity date and request repayment of the loan principal, plus interest and charges on or before a specified date. If the producer does not repay the loan or have the cotton ginned and obtain a nonrecourse loan under subpart A of this part on the resulting lint cotton within the period specified by the county committee, the cotton will be considered abandoned.

        (d) If the producer has control of the storage site and if the producer subsequently loses control of the storage site or there is danger of flood or damage to the seed cotton or storage structure making continued storage of the cotton unsafe, the producer must immediately either repay the loan or move the seed cotton to the nearest approved gin for ginning and must, at the same time, inform the FSA county office. If the producer does not do so, the seed cotton will be considered abandoned.

        (e) CCC will not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the loan collateral for recourse seed cotton loans.

        Any seed cotton pledged as collateral for a loan that is abandoned or has not been ginned and pledged as collateral for a nonrecourse loan under subpart A of this part by the seed cotton loan maturity date may be removed from storage by CCC and ginned and the resulting lint cotton warehoused for the account of CCC. The lint cotton and cottonseed may be sold at such time, in such manner and upon such terms as CCC may determine, at public or private sale. CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or any part of such cotton and cottonseed. If the proceeds received from the sales of the cotton are less than the amount due on the loan (including principal, interest, ginning charges, and any other charges incurred by CCC), the producer is liable for such difference. If the proceeds received from sale of the cotton are greater than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in conducting the sale of the cotton, the amount of such excess will be paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the producer.

        § 1427.175   Liability of the producer.

#### § § 1427.175

        (a)(1) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan, maintaining a loan, or settling a loan or if the producer disposes of or moves the loan collateral without the prior approval of CCC, such loan amount must be refunded upon demand by CCC. The producer will be liable for:

        (i) The amount of the loan;

        (ii) Any additional amounts paid by CCC for the loan;

        (iii) All other costs which CCC would not have incurred but for the fraudulent representation or the unauthorized disposition or movement of the loan collateral;

        (iv) Applicable interest on such amounts; and

        (v) Liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section.

        (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the note and security agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent representation or if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without prior written approval from CCC, the value of such collateral acquired by CCC will be equal to the sales price of the cotton less any costs incurred by CCC in completing the sale.

        (b) If the amount disbursed under a loan, or in settlement thereof, exceeds the amount authorized by this subpart, the producer is liable for repayment of such excess, plus interest. In addition, seed cotton pledged as collateral for such loan will not be released to the producer until such excess is repaid.

        (c) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the loan is less than the amount required under this subpart, the producer is personally liable for repayment of the amount of such deficiency plus applicable interest.

        (d) If more than one producer executes a note and security agreement with CCC, each such producer is jointly and severally liable for the violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement and the regulations in this subpart. Each such producer also remains liable for repayment of the entire loan amount until the loan is fully repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in the seed cotton pledged as collateral for the loan. In addition, such producer may not amend the note and security agreement for the producer's claimed share in such seed cotton, after execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.

        (e) If a producer makes any fraudulent representation in obtaining a loan, in maintaining or settling a loan, or disposing of or moving the collateral without the prior approval of CCC, that is a violation of the terms or conditions of the note and security agreement. If CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has violated the terms or conditions of the note and security agreement, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity of the seed cotton that is involved in the violation by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note. This amount will apply for both good faith and not good faith determinations.

        (f) For first and second offenses, if CCC or the county committee determines that a producer acted in good faith when the violation occurred, the county committee will:

        (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan quantity affected by the violation, and charges plus interest applicable to the amount repaid;

        (2) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (3) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days from the date of notification, call the applicable loan involved in the violation.

        (g) For cases other than first or second offenses, or any offense for which CCC or the county committee cannot determine good faith when the violation occurred, the county committee will:

        (1) Assess liquidated damages under paragraph (e) of this section;

        (2) Call the applicable loan involved in the violation.

        (h) If CCC or the county committee determines that the producer has committed a violation under paragraph (e) of this section, the county committee shall notify the producer in writing that:

        (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and information to the county committee regarding the circumstances which caused the violation, and

        (2) Administrative actions will be taken under paragraphs (f) or (g) of this section.

        (i) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed under the provision of paragraph (e) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.

      Subpart E—Standards for Approval of Warehouses for Cotton and Cotton Linters

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 4 and 5, 62 Stat. 1070, as amended, 1072, as amended (15 U.S.C. 714 b and c).

**Source:** Source: 44 FR 67085, Nov. 23, 1979, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1427.1081   General statement and administration.

#### § § 1427.1081

        (a) This subpart prescribes the requirements which must be met and the procedures which must be followed by a warehouseman in the United States or Puerto Rico who desires the approval by the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “CCC”) of warehouse(s) for the storage and handling of cotton and cotton linters, under a Cotton Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or held by CCC as security for price support loans. This subpart is not applicable to cotton or cotton linters purchased in storage for prompt shipment or to handling operations of a temporary nature.

        (b) Copies of the CCC storage agreement and forms required for obtaining approval under this subpart may be obtained from the Kansas City Commodity Office, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141 (hereinafter referred to as the “KCCO”).

        (c) A warehouse must be approved by the KCCO and a storage agreement must be in effect between CCC and the warehouseman before CCC will use such warehouse. The approval of a warehouse or the entering into of a storage agreement does not constitute a commitment that CCC will use the warehouse, and no official or employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is authorized to make any such commitment.

        (d) A warehouseman, when applying for approval under this subpart must submit to CCC at KCCO:

        (1) A completed “Application for Approval of Warehouse for Storage of Cotton and/or Cotton Linters,”

        (2) A current financial statement on a “Financial Statement” form, supported by such supplemental schedules as CCC may request. Financial statements may be submitted on forms other than a “Financial Statement” form with approval of the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee. Financial statements must show the financial condition of the warehouseman as of a date no earlier than 90 days prior to the date of the warehouseman's application, or such other date as CCC may prescribe. Additional financial statements must be furnished annually and at such other times as CCC may require. CCC also may require that financial statements prepared by the warehouseman or by a public accountant be examined by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Only one financial statement is required for a chain of warehouses owned or operated by a single business entity. If approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee, the financial statement of a parent company, which includes the financial position of a wholly-owned subsidiary, may be used to meet the CCC standards for approval for the wholly-owned subsidiary.

        (3) Evidence that the warehouseman is licensed by the appropriate licensing authority as required under § 1427.1082(a)(2) and such other documents or information as CCC may require,

        (4) For warehouseman not operating under the U.S. Warehouse Act, a sample copy of the warehouseman's receipts and bale tags, and

        (5) Evidence of applicable fire insurance rates.

        (1) The warehouseman must:

        (i) Be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity engaged in the business of storing or handling for hire, or both, the applicable commodity. The warehouseman, if a corporation, must be authorized by its charter to engage in such business,

        (iii) Have a net worth which is the greater of $25,000 or the amount which results from multiplying the maximum storage capacity of the warehouse (the total number of bales of cotton or cotton linters which the warehouse can accommodate when stored in the customary manner) times ten (10) dollars per bale. The net worth need not exceed $250,000. If the calculated net worth exceeds $25,000, the warehouseman may satisfy any deficiency in net worth between the $25,000 minimum requirement and such calculated net worth by furnishing bond (or acceptable substitute security) meeting the requirements of § 1427.1083,

        (iv) Have available sufficient funds to meet ordinary operating expenses,

        (v) Have satisfactorily corrected, upon request by CCC, any deficiencies in the performance of any storage agreement with CCC,

        (vi) Maintain accurate and complete inventory and operating records,

        (vii) Use only card type warehouse receipts which are pre-numbered and pre-punched or such other document as CCC may prescribe,

        (viii) Have available at the warehouse adequate and operable firefighting equipment for the type of warehouse and applicable stored commodity, and

        (ix) Have a work force and equipment available to provide adequate storage and handling service.

        (2) The warehouseman, officials, or supervisory employees of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operation must have the necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications, and skills in the warehousing business regarding the applicable commodities to enable them to provide proper storage and handling services.

        (3) Warehouseman, officials and each of the supervisory employees of the warehouseman in charge of the warehouse operation must:

        (i) Have a satisfactory record of integrity, judgment, and performance, and

        (ii) Be neither suspended nor debarred under applicable CCC suspension and debarment regulations.

        (4) The warehouse must:

        (i) Be of sound construction, in good state of repair, and adequately equipped to receive, handle, store, preserve, and deliver the applicable commodity,

        (ii) Be under the control of the contracting warehouseman at all times, and

        (iii) Not be subject to greater than normal risk of fire, flood, or other hazards.

        § 1427.1083   Bonding requirements for net worth.

#### § § 1427.1083

        (a) A bond furnished by a warehouseman under this subpart must meet the following requirements:

        (1) Such bond must be executed by a surety which:

        (i) Has been approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, and

        (ii) Maintains an officer or representative authorized to accept service of legal process and in the State where the warehouse is located.

        (2) Such bond must be on the Warehouseman's Bond form, except that a bond furnished under State law (statutory bond) or under operational rules of nongovernmental supervisory agencies may be accepted in an equivalent amount as a substitute for a bond running directly to CCC if:

        (i) CCC determines that such bond provides adequate protection to CCC.

        (ii) It has been executed by a surety specified in paragraph (a) of this section or has a blanket rider and endorsement executed by such a surety with the liability of the surety under such rider or endorsement being the same as that of the surety under the original bond, and

        (iii) It is noncancellable for not less than ninety (90) days or includes a rider providing for not less than ninety (90) days' notice to CCC before cancellation. Excess coverage on a substitute bond for one warehouse will not be accepted or applied by CCC against insufficient bond coverage on other warehouses.

        (3) Cash and negotiable securities offered by a warehouseman may be accepted by CCC in lieu of the equivalent amount of required bond coverage. Any such cash or negotiable securities accepted by CCC will be returned to the warehouseman when the period for which coverage was required has ended and there appears to CCC to be no liability under the storage agreement.

        (4) A legal liability insurance policy may be accepted by CCC in lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided such policy contains a clause or rider making the policy payable to CCC, CCC determines that it affords protection equivalent to a bond, and the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, approves it for legal sufficiency.

        (5) An irrevocable letter of credit may be accepted by CCC in lieu of the required amount of bond coverage provided that the issuing bank is a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such standby letter of credit must be on the Irrevocable Letter of Credit form, or on such other form as may be specifically approved by the Director, KCCO, or the Director's designee.

        § 1427.1084   Examination of warehouses.

#### § § 1427.1084

        Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a warehouse must be examined by a person designated by CCC before it may be approved by CCC for the storage and handling of the commodity and periodically thereafter to determine its compliance with CCC's standards and requirements.

        § 1427.1085   Exceptions.

#### § § 1427.1085

        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this report:

        (a) The financial bond and original and periodic warehouse examination provisions of this subpart do not apply to any warehouseman approved or applying for approval for the storage and handling of cotton or cotton linters under CCC programs if the warehouse is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act for such commodity but a special examination will be made of such warehouse whenever CCC determines such action is necessary.

        (b) A warehouseman who has a net worth of at least $25,000 but who fails, or whose warehouse fails, to meet one or more of the other standards of this subpart may be approved if:

        (1) CCC determines that the warehouse services are needed and the warehouse storage and handling conditions provide satisfactory protection for the commodity,

        (2) The warehouseman furnishes such additional bond coverage (or cash or acceptable negotiable securities or legal liability insurance policy) as may be prescribed by CCC.

        § 1427.1086   Approval of warehouse, requests for reconsideration.

#### § § 1427.1086

        (a) CCC will approve a warehouse if it determines that the warehouse meets the standards set forth in this subpart. CCC will send a notice of approval to the warehouseman. Approval under this subpart, however, does not relieve the warehouseman of the responsibility for performing the warehouseman's obligations under any agreement with CCC or any other agency of the United States.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart:

        (1) CCC will not approve the warehouse if CCC determines that the warehouse does not meet the standards set forth in this subpart, and

        (2) CCC will send any notice of rejection of approval to the warehouseman. This notice will state the cause(s) for such action. Unless the warehouseman or any officials or supervisory employees of the warehouseman are suspended or debarred, CCC will approve the warehouse if the warehouseman establishes that the causes for CCC's rejection of approval have been remedied.

        (c) If rejection of approval by CCC is due to the warehouseman's failure to meet the standards set forth:

        (1) In § 1427.1082, other than the standard specified in § 1427.1082(c)(2), the warehouseman may, at any time after receiving notice of such action, request reconsideration of the action and present to the Director, KCCO, in writing, information in support of such request. The Director will consider such information in making a determination and notify the warehouseman in writing of such determination. The warehouseman may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal hearing by filing an appeal with the Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, Farm Service Agency (FSA). The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal, nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the hearing will be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals, 7 CFR part 780. When appealing under such regulations, the warehouseman will be considered as a “participant”; and

        (2) In § 1427.1082(c)(2), the warehouseman's administrative appeal rights with respect to suspension and debarment shall be in accordance with applicable CCC regulations. After expiration of a period of suspension or debarment, a warehouseman may, at any time, apply for approval under this subpart.

        § 1427.1087   Exemption from requirements.

#### § § 1427.1087

        (a) If warehousing services in any area cannot be secured under the provisions of this subpart and no reasonable and economical alternative is available for securing such services for commodities under CCC programs, the President or Executive Vice President, CCC may exempt, in writing, applicants in such area from one or more of the standards of this subpart and may establish such other standards as are considered necessary to safeguard satisfactorily the interests of CCC.

        (b) Warehousemen who are currently under contract with CCC will be required to meet the terms and conditions of these regulations at the time of renewal of their contract.

        (1) A warehouseman who has an existing Cotton Storage Agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or cotton pledged to CCC as loan collateral must pay an annual contract fee for each warehouse approved under such agreement in advance of the renewal date of such agreement.

        (2) A warehouseman who does not have an existing Cotton Storage Agreement with CCC for the storage and handling of CCC-owned cotton or cotton pledged to CCC as loan collateral but who desires such an agreement must pay a contract fee for each warehouse for which CCC approval is sought prior to the time that the agreement is approved by CCC.

        (b) The amount of the contract fee will be determined and announced annually.

        (b) Whenever a 4-week period under paragraph (a) of this section contains a combination of LFQ, LFQc, and LFQf for only one to three weeks, such as may occur in the spring when the LFQ is succeeded by the LFQc and the LFQf (spring transition), and at the start of a new marketing year when the LFQc and the LFQf are succeeded by the LFQ (marketing year transition), under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, during both the spring transition and the marketing year transition periods, the LFQc and USPFEc, in combination with the LFQ and USPFE, will, to the extent practicable, be considered during such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is to be issued. During both the spring transition and the marketing year transition periods, if either or both USPFEc price and the LFQc are not available, the USPFEf and the LFQf in combination with the USPFE price and LFQ will be taken into consideration during such 4-week periods to determine whether a payment is to be issued.

        (c) For purposes of this subpart, regarding the determination of the USPFE, USPFEc, USPFEf, the LFQ, the LFQc, and the LFQf:

        (1) If daily quotations are not available for one or more days of the 5-day period, the available quotations during the period will be used;

        (2) If none of the USPFE, USPFEc, or USPFEf prices is available, or if none of the LFQ, LFQc, or LFQf is available, the payment rate will be zero and will remain zero unless and until sufficient USPFE prices or the LFQ again becomes available, the USPFE, USPFEc, or USPFEf price exceeds the LFQ, the LFQc, or the LFQf, as the case may be, and the LFQ, the LFQc, or the LFQf, as the case may be, adjusted for transportation, is less than 113 percent of the current crop year loan rate for base quality U.S. Pima for 4 consecutive weeks.

        (d) Payment rates for loose lint that is of a suitable quality, without further processing, for spinning, papermaking or bleaching, will be based on a percentage of the basic rate for baled lint, as specified in the ELS Cotton Domestic User/Exporter Agreement.

        § 1427.1208   Payment.

#### § § 1427.1208

        (a) Payments under this subpart will be determined by multiplying:

        (1) The payment rate, determined under § 1427.127, by

        (2) The net weight (gross weight minus the weight of bagging and ties) determined under paragraph (b) of this section, of eligible ELS cotton bales that an eligible domestic user opens or an eligible exporter exports during the Friday through Thursday period following a week in which a payment rate is established.

        (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the net weight will be based upon:

        (1) For domestic users, the weight on which settlement for payment of the ELS cotton was based (landed mill weight);

        (2) For exporters, the shipping warehouse weight or the gin weight if the ELS cotton was not placed in a warehouse, of the eligible cotton unless the exporter obtains and pays the cost of having all the bales in the shipment re-weighed by a licensed weigher and furnishes a copy of the certified weights.

        (c) For the purposes of this subpart, eligible ELS cotton will be considered:

        (1) Consumed by the domestic user on the date the bale is opened for consumption; and

        (2) Exported by the exporter on the date that CCC determines is the date on which the cotton is shipped for export.

        (d) Payments under this subpart will be made available upon application for payment and submission of supporting documentation, as required by this subpart, CCC instructions, and the ELS Cotton Domestic User/Exporter Agreement.

      (a) To be eligible for payment, asparagus producers must submit a completed application for payment and meet other eligibility requirements as specified in this part. Asparagus producers may obtain an application in person, by mail, by telephone, or by facsimile from any FSA county office. In addition, applicants may download a copy of the application from

      (b) An application for payment must be submitted on a completed application form. Applications and any other supporting documentation must be submitted to the FSA county office serving the county in which the producer produced asparagus in 2003 unless the producer now resides in a different county than the county in which asparagus was produced in the base period.

      (c) Asparagus producers who apply for payment must certify the information on the application before the application will be considered complete. Applications may be accompanied by acceptable production records for all fresh and processed asparagus produced and marketed from the farm in the 2003 crop year. Producers must certify they had a share interest in both 2003 and 2007 crop asparagus. To be eligible for payment on asparagus produced in the base period, the producer must have produced asparagus in 2007 for the commercial market in commercial quantities as determined for this purpose by the Deputy Administrator.

Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without it program payments will not be approved. Providing a false certification may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties or sanctions.

      (e) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine eligibility for program payments. Although participation in the Asparagus Revenue Market Loss Assistance Payment Program is voluntary, program payments will not be provided unless the participant furnishes a complete application by the end of the application period with all requested data.

      (f) Individuals or entities who submit applications after the application period are not entitled to any payment consideration or determination of eligibility. Regardless of the reason why an application is not submitted to or received by the FSA county office, any late application will be considered as not having been timely filed and the applicants on that application will not be eligible for the Asparagus Revenue Marketing Loss Assistance Payment Program.

      § 1429.105   Producer eligibility requirements.

#### § § 1429.105

      (a) To be eligible to receive the Asparagus Revenue Marketing Loss Assistance Payment Program payments, asparagus producers must submit an application during the application period and must:

      (1) Have produced and marketed asparagus in commercial quantities in commercial markets in the United States during both of the 2003 and 2007 crop years;

      (2) Be an asparagus producer, as defined in § 1429.103, for the 2003 and 2007 crop years;

      (3) Certify their shares and the pounds of fresh and processed asparagus produced and marketed from the farm operation during the 2003 crop year as reflected on the application;

      (4) If the total value of payments claimed exceeds the available funding, have an average adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $2.5 million for the 3 tax years of 2003 through 2005; and

      (5) Be in compliance with the requirements in 7 CFR part 12 regarding highly erodible cropland and wetlands and meet any general farm program eligibility requirements that apply under 7 CFR part 1400 or other regulations as applicable.

      (b) Asparagus producers must sign an application to be considered for payment eligibility. Asparagus producers who do not sign an application will not receive payment or a determination of eligibility, even if other producers in the asparagus farm operation sign an application and receive payment.

      (c) Each applicant determined by spot check or other information to not have an interest as an asparagus producer in 2003 and 2007 who meets the other qualifications of this part will be ineligible for payment and such applicant's claimed share shown on the application will not be paid.

      § 1429.106   Proof of production.

#### § § 1429.106

      (a) Producers selected for spot check by CCC must, in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator or a designee, provide adequate proof of the fresh and processed asparagus produced and marketed during the 2003 and 2007 crop years.

      (b) If adequate proof of marketed production and supporting documentation in support of any application for payment is not presented to the satisfaction of CCC or the FSA county office requesting information, the application and the producers on that application will be determined ineligible for payment.

#### § § 1429.107

      (a) Subject to the funding limits that may apply to the program, the estimated maximum per pound payment rates for fresh market asparagus and for processed market asparagus are:

      (1) $1.06 per pound ($106.00 per hundredweight) for 2003 crop quantities of asparagus marketed to fresh markets; and

      (2) $1.08 per pound ($108.00 per hundredweight) for 2003 crop quantities of asparagus marketed for processing.

      (b) This program will be administered to assure that total payments do not exceed the available funding. If the total value of payments claimed calculated using the maximum payment rates specified in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the funding available for each marketing category, less any reserve that may be created as specified in § 1429.109, the payment quantities will be paid at a lower rate determined by dividing the funds available in each marketing category of asparagus, by the payment quantity from applications received by the end of the application period in each marketing category.

      (c) In no event will the payment rate exceed the maximum payment rate for each marketing category of asparagus determined in paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 1429.108   Calculation of individual payments.

#### § § 1429.108

      (a) Producers will be eligible for payment for both fresh and processed asparagus. CCC will calculate the payment quantity of 2003 fresh and processed asparagus for an asparagus farm operation based on the lower of:

      (1) Reported production reflected on the application, or

      (2) If applicable, determined production.

      (b) The payment quantity will be multiplied by the following:

      (1) Each asparagus producer's share, and

      (2) The payment rate for the fresh or processed asparagus determined as specified in § 1429.107.

      (c) If the total value of payments claimed exceeds the available funding, payments to producers are subject to a $100,000 cap per each of the two program marketing categories (fresh and processed) per asparagus producer as defined in this part, not per “person” or “legal entity” as those terms might be defined in part 1400 of this title.

      § 1429.109   Availability of funds.

#### § § 1429.109

      (a) Payments specified in this part are subject to the availability of funds. The total available program funds will be $15,000,000 as provided by section 10404 of Public Law 110-246.

      (b) Of the available funds, $7,500,000 are allocated for fresh market asparagus production and $7,500,000 are allocated to processed market asparagus.

      (c) CCC will prorate the available funds by a national factor to ensure that payments do not exceed $15,000,000. CCC will prorate the payments in such manner as it, in its sole discretion, finds fair and reasonable.

      (d) A reserve will be created to handle appeals and errors. Claims will not be payable once the available funding is expended. Any amount of funds reserved for such purposes that are not disbursed for the purpose of correcting errors or omissions, or for the payment of appeals, will not otherwise be distributed to any payment applicants and will be refunded to the U.S. Department of Treasury.

      § 1429.111   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1429.111

      (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions, or remedies as may apply, an asparagus producer will be ineligible to receive assistance through the Asparagus Revenue Market Loss Assistance Payment Program if the asparagus producer is determined by CCC to have:

      (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of this program;

      (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

      (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

      (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to any person or operation engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due and all charges including interest will run from the date of the disbursement of the CCC funds. Any asparagus farm operation, asparagus producer, or person engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any asparagus farm operation, asparagus producer, or person receiving payment as specified in this part will be jointly and severally liable with other persons or operations involved in such claim for payment for any refund due as specified in this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this part will be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

      § 1429.112   Death, incompetence, or disappearance.

#### § § 1429.112

      (a) In the case of death, incompetency, disappearance, or dissolution of a person or an entity that is eligible to receive payment as specified in this part, an alternate person or persons as specified in part 707 of this title may receive such payment, as determined appropriate by CCC.

      (b) Payment may be made for asparagus market losses suffered by an otherwise eligible asparagus producer who is now deceased or is a dissolved entity if a representative who currently has authority to enter into an application for the producer or the producer's estate signs the application for payment. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased producer's estate or a dissolved entity must be provided. If an asparagus producer is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly-authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.

      (c) Persons signing an ALAP Program application as having an interest in the asparagus farm operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due as specified in this section.

      (d) Interest will be applicable to any refunds required as specified in parts 792 and 1403 of this title. Such interest will be charged at the rate that the U.S. Department of the Treasury charges CCC for funds, and will accrue from the date CCC made the erroneous payment to the date of repayment.

      (e) CCC may waive the accrual of interest if it determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action of the person, or was beyond the control of the person committing the violation. Any waiver is at the discretion of CCC alone.

        § 1430.103   Eligible dairy operations.

#### § § 1430.103

        (a) The eligibility requirements for a dairy operation to register in MPP-Dairy and receive payments under this subpart, are to:

        (1) Produce milk from cows in the United States that is marketed commercially at the time of each annual election in MPP-Dairy;

        (2) Submit accurate and complete information as required by the this subpart;

        (3) Provide proof of milk production marketed commercially by all persons in the dairy operation to establish production history;

        (4) Not participate in the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy (LGM-Dairy) Program administered by the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1536), except to the extent permitted by this subpart, provided that under no circumstance may the operation receive coverage for the same period in MPP-Dairy for which payments have been received or earned under LGM-Dairy; and

        (5) Pay required administrative fees for participation in MPP-Dairy as specified in this subpart and any premiums, if applicable, as specified in this subpart.

        (b) A person or entity covered by § 1400.401 of this chapter (hereafter “foreign person”) must meet the eligibility requirements contained in that section to receive payments under this part. A dairy operation with ineligible foreign persons as members will have any payment reduced by the proportional share of such members.

        (c) Federal agencies and States, including all agencies and political subdivisions of a State, are not eligible for payments under this subpart.

        (d) As specified in § 1430.104, each dairy operation is required to submit a separate registration to be eligible for MPP-Dairy coverage and payment. A producer who owns more than one eligible dairy operation may participate separately for each dairy operation; each eligible dairy operation must be registered separately, subject to the affiliation test for new operations.

        (e) A new dairy operation will be treated as an affiliated dairy operation and not be treated as a separate dairy operation under MPP-Dairy if producers that collectively own more than 50 percent of the new dairy operation also collectively own more than 50 percent interest in another dairy operation registered in MPP-Dairy.

        § 1430.104   Time and method of registration and annual election.

#### § § 1430.104

        (a) A dairy operation may register to participate in MPP-Dairy by submitting a contract prescribed by CCC. Dairy operations may obtain a blank contract in person, by mail, or by facsimile from any county office. In addition, dairy operations may download a copy of the forms at

        (b) Dairy operation shall submit completed contracts and any other supporting documentation during the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator, to the administrative county office serving the dairy operation.

        (1) A new dairy operation that has been established after the most recent election period is required to submit a contract within the first 90 calendar days from the date on of which the dairy operation first commercially markets milk and may elect coverage that begins the next consecutive 2-month period following the submission date of the registration and coverage election; or

        (2) A new dairy operation that does not meet the 90 day requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot enroll until the next annual election period for coverage for the following calendar year.

        (c) Registration requests and coverage elections are to be submitted in time to be received at FSA by the close of business on the last day of the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator.

        (1) The applicable year of coverage for contracts arising from accepted registrations in the annual election period will be the following calendar year.

        (2) Registration requests and coverage elections submitted after the applicable allowed time for submission will not be considered.

        (3) During an annual election period, participating dairy operations may change coverage elections for the following calendar year.

        (d) To receive margin protection coverage, separate registrations are required for each separately constituted dairy operation. If a dairy producer operates more than one separate and distinct operation, the producer registers each operation for each operation to be eligible for coverage.

        (e) A participating dairy operation must elect, during the applicable annual election period and by using the form prescribed by CCC, the coverage level threshold and coverage percentage for that participating dairy operation for the applicable calendar year.

        (1) Once the initial completed registration is submitted and approved by CCC, it cannot be cancelled by the participating dairy operation through December 31, 2018; however, each calendar year subsequent to the initial registration of the participating dairy operation, it may elect to change the coverage level threshold and coverage percentage, on a form prescribed by CCC, during the election period for the applicable subsequent calendar year. For dairy operations that want to continue coverage levels established in the prior calendar year, the Deputy Administrator will establish a procedure to allow such coverage levels to continue that will include the requirement of a timely payment of administrative fees and any premiums, if applicable.

        (2) If the operation fails to file an update of its election during the annual election period, the coverage level will be reduced to the catastrophic level coverage, but such coverage will only be provided if the participating dairy operation pays the annual administrative fee for the relevant calendar year and submits the appropriate CCC forms.

        (3) All producers in the participating dairy operation must agree to the coverage level threshold and coverage percentage elected by the dairy operation.

        (f) By registering to participate or receive payment under MPP-Dairy, producers in the participating dairy operation certify to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information in their applications and supporting documentation.

        (1) All producers in a participating dairy operation must sign and certify all submissions made under MPP-Dairy that relate to the level of coverage.

        (2) All information provided is subject to verification. FSA may require a dairy operation to provide documentation to support all verifiable records. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without it MPP-Dairy benefits will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Federal Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, other penalties, or sanctions.

        (g) At the time the completed contract is submitted to FSA for the first year in which the dairy operation is to participate in MPP-Dairy, the dairy operation must also submit a separate form, as specified by CCC, to establish the production history for the dairy operation.

        § 1430.105   Establishment and transfer of production history for a participating dairy operation.

#### § § 1430.105

        (a) A participating dairy operation must provide all information required by FSA to establish the production history of the participating dairy operation for purposes of participating in MPP-Dairy. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section relating to new dairy operations, FSA will establish the production history for a dairy operation for margin protection as the highest annual milk marketings of the participating dairy operation during any one of the 2011, 2012, or 2013 calendar years.

        (1) All producers in the participating dairy operation are required to provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's quantity of milk commercially marketed, to establish the production history for the dairy operation.

        (2) All information provided is subject to verification, spot check and audit by FSA. If the dairy operation does not provide to the satisfaction of FSA documentation requested to substantiate the production history of the highest annual milk marketings for the participating dairy operation, then, the registration will not be approved.

        (b) A participating dairy operation that did not produce and commercially market milk at least 12 full months as of February 7, 2014, will be considered a new dairy operation. To establish the production history for such a new dairy operation the new dairy operation is required to elect one of the following methods:

        (1) The volume of the actual milk marketings for the months the dairy operation has been in operation, extrapolated to a yearly amount based on a national seasonally adjusted index, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, to account for differences in milk production during the year; or

        (2) An estimate of the actual milk marketings of the dairy operation based on the herd size of the dairy operation relative to the national rolling herd average data published by the Secretary.

        (c) If FSA determines that the new enterprise was formed for the purpose of circumventing MPP-Dairy provisions, including, but not limited to, reconstituting a dairy operation to receive additional benefits, or establishing new production history, that enterprise will not be considered a new dairy operation for the purpose of establishing production history.

        (d) Once the production history of a participating dairy operation is established as specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the production history will be adjusted upward by FSA only to reflect any increase in the national average milk production, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, except as provided by paragraph (g) of this section.

        (e) The production history may be transferred from one dairy facility to another:

        (1) Producers of a dairy operation may relocate the dairy operation to another location and the production history of the original operation may be transferred to the new location and may be added to production history at the new location that has not been transferred;

        (2) Producers of a dairy operation may transfer ownership of a dairy operation with its associated production history, but if the producers start a new operation such new operation may only be eligible for new production history if the new operation is otherwise not affiliated with participants in MPP-Dairy as described in § 1430.103(e); or

        (3) Producers of more than one dairy operation that separately participate in MPP-Dairy may transfer the production histories of these dairy operations into a previously unregistered dairy operation.

        (f) If CCC waives the obligation, under MPP-Dairy of a participating dairy operation due to death or retirement of the producer or of the permanent dissolution of the dairy operation or under other circumstances as determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA may reestablish the production history provided that the production history has not been transferred.

        (g) The established production history of a participating dairy operation may be adjusted upward once during the term of the contract for an intergenerational transfer based on the purchase of additional cows by the new family member(s). The increase in the established production history of the participating dairy operation will be determined on the basis of the national rolling herd average data for the current year in effect at the time of the intergenerational transfer and the quantity of the production history increase will be limited to an amount not more than 4 million pounds. The additional quantity of production history will receive coverage at the same elected coverage threshold and coverage percentage in effect for the participating dairy operation at the time the production history increase takes effect. Intergenerational transfers will not be allowed if the participating dairy operation's current annual production and the increase in herd size by the new member(s) is less than the operation's established production history.

        (1) The dairy operation must notify FSA, using the appropriate CCC form(s), of the intergenerational transfer within 60 days of the purchase of the cows, except that for purchases made for intergenerational transfers occurring between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2016, the dairy operation must notify FSA during the registration and annual coverage election period for coverage year 2017, established by the Deputy Administrator. The operation has the option of the additional production history taking effect beginning either with the consecutive 2-month period following notification, or the following January 1. If the additional production history takes effect between January 1 and August 31, the premium is due September 1, as specified in § 1430.107(a)(2). If the additional production history takes effect between September 1 and December 31, the premium is due immediately.

        (2) All of the items specified in this paragraph must be documented in the notification to FSA and self-certified by the current and new member(s) for the intergenerational transfer to be considered eligible for additional production history, except that intergenerational transfers that occurred in 2014 and 2015 that otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph will be considered during the registration and annual coverage election period for coverage year 2017 established by the Deputy Administrator for the purposes of adding the new member(s) to the participating dairy operation. However, there will not be any retroactive payments based on a production history increase for the intergenerational transfer. All of the following information is subject to verification by CCC. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of USDA to verify any information provided will result in disapproval of the intergenerational transfer.

        (i) Documentation that the new member(s) joining the operation have purchased the dairy cows being added to the dairy operation;

        (ii) Certification that each new member will have a share of the profits or losses from the dairy operation commensurate with such person's contributions to the dairy operation;

        (iii) Certification that each new member has a significant equity ownership in the participating dairy operation at levels determined by the Deputy Administrator and announced on the FSA Web site,

        (iv) Certification that each new member is a lineal descendant or spouse thereof of a current member of the participating dairy operation;

        (v) Agreement that each new member will contribute labor in the dairy operation at a minimum of 35 hours per week or have a plan for transition to full-time, subject to FSA county committee review and approval, if only working seasonally or part-time;

        (vi) Certification that the dairy operation will be the principal source of non-investment earned income for each new member; and

        (vii) Documentation of the participating dairy operation's current annual marketings as of the date of the intergenerational transfer.

        § 1430.106   Administrative fees.

#### § § 1430.106

        (a) Dairy operations must pay an initial administrative fee to CCC in the amount of $100 at the time of initial registration to participate in MPP-Dairy. Each approved participating dairy operation must also pay a $100 administrative fee each year through 2018. Annual administrative fees are due and payable to CCC through the administrative county FSA office no later than the close of business on the last day of the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator for each applicable calendar year of margin protection coverage under MPP-Dairy. The administrative fee paid is non-refundable.

        (b) The required annual administrative fee is per dairy operation. Therefore, multiple dairy producers in a single participating dairy operation are required to pay only one annual administrative fee for the participating dairy operation. Conversely, in the case of a dairy producer that operates more than one dairy operation, each participating dairy operation is required to pay a separate administrative fee annually.

        (c) Failure to pay the administrative fee timely will result in loss of margin protection coverage for the applicable calendar year. The payment will still be due, as provided in § 1430.109.  However, coverage for the applicable calendar year, at the catastrophic level only, may be reinstated if the administrative fee is paid late, effective the consecutive 2-month period following payment of the late-filed administrative fee plus applicable charges, if any, and submission to FSA of the appropriate CCC form.

        § 1430.107   Buy-up coverage.

#### § § 1430.107

        (a) For purposes of receiving buy-up MPP-Dairy coverage, a participating dairy operation may annually elect during an annual election period the following for the succeeding calendar year:

        (1) A coverage level threshold for margins that, per cwt, is equal to one of the following: $4.50, $5, $5.50, $6, $6.50, $7, $7.50, or $8; and

        (2) A percentage of coverage for the production history from 25 percent to 90 percent, in 5-percent increments.

        (b) In the absence of any such election, the applicable coverage level provided, with no premium due, is catastrophic level coverage.

        (c) A participating dairy operation that elects margin protection coverage above $4 is required to pay an annual premium based on coverage level and covered production history in addition to the administrative fee. Tier 1 applies to covered production history up to and including 4 million pounds; Tier 2 applies to covered production history above 4 million pounds.

        (d) The premium per cwt of milk, based on the elected percentage of coverage of production history is specified in the following table.

        (e) The annual premium due for a participating dairy operation is calculated by multiplying:

        (1) The covered production history; and

        (2) The premium per cwt of milk specified in paragraph (d) of this section for the coverage level elected by the dairy operation.

        (f) In the case of a new dairy operation that first registers to participate in MPP-Dairy for a calendar year after the start of the calendar year, the participating dairy operation is required to pay a pro-rated premium for that calendar year based on the portion of the calendar year for which the participating dairy operation is eligible, and for which it purchases the coverage.

        (g) A participating dairy operation is required to pay the annual premium calculated as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for the applicable calendar year, according to either of the following options:

        (1) In total at time of submission of coverage election to FSA; or

        (2) In total no later than September 1 of the applicable calendar year of coverage, unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator.

        (h) If the total premium is not paid for an applicable calendar year of coverage as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the participating dairy operation will only be covered at catastrophic level coverage beginning with the September-October consecutive 2-month period and for the remainder of the applicable coverage year.

        (i) Annual premium balances due CCC from a participating dairy operation for a calendar year of coverage must be paid in full no later than September 1 of the applicable calendar year or within a grace period determined by the Deputy Administrator, if applicable.

        (j) A participating dairy operation with an unpaid premium balance for a calendar year of coverage will lose eligibility for buy-up coverage for the subsequent coverage year if the premium is not paid in full by the close of the coverage election period, and will have its current buy-up level coverage reduced to the catastrophic level, as provided in § 1430.109.

        (k) The Deputy Administrator may waive the obligation to pay the premium, or refund the premium paid, of a participating dairy operation for a calendar year, in cases that include, but are not limited to, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, death, retirement, permanent dissolution of a participating dairy operation, or other circumstances determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (l) MPP-Dairy administrative fees and premiums are required to be paid by a negotiable instrument satisfactory to FSA and made payable to CCC and either mailed to or provided in person to the administrative county office or other location designated by FSA.

        (m) In the case of an intergenerational transfer, the additional premium, if any, is due September 1 if the notification of the transfer is made to FSA between January 1 and September 1 of the applicable calendar year, and immediately, if the notification is made between September 2 and December 31, unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator.

        § 1430.108   Margin protection payments.

#### § § 1430.108

        (a)  An MPP-Dairy payment will be made to a participating dairy operation for any consecutive 2-month period when the average actual dairy production margin for the consecutive 2-month period falls below the coverage level threshold in effect for the participating dairy operation. Payments may trigger at either the elected buy-up level if purchased by the dairy operation, or the catastrophic level.

        (b)  Whether payments trigger at the catastrophic level or at the buy-up level, the payments will be calculated as explained in this paragraph. If the dairy operation only has catastrophic coverage or buy-up coverage at 90 percent, there will be a single calculation. If the dairy operation purchased buy-up coverage at less than 90 percent and the catastrophic level also triggers a payment, then there will be two calculations to determine the payment—first the calculation for the buy-up coverage percentage and then the calculation for the catastrophic level percentage, which is the balance of the established production history up to 90 percent; the result of these two calculations will be added together to determine the payment amount. Each calculation multiplies the payment rate times the coverage percentage times the production history divided by 6 as follows:

        (1)  The amount by which the coverage level exceeds the average actual dairy production margin for the 2-month period;

        (2)  The coverage percentage; and

        (3)  The production history of the dairy operation, divided by 6.

        (c)  If the dairy operation purchased buy-up level coverage at less than 90 percent of production history, then the dairy operation will receive a payment calculated at the buy-up level, plus the payment at the catastrophic level, if triggered, for the balance of 90 percent of its established production history. For example, if a producer purchased buy-up coverage at the 50 percent level, then that producer will also receive catastrophic level coverage for the next 40 percent for total coverage of 90 percent.

        § 1430.109   Effect of failure to pay administrative fees or premiums.

#### § § 1430.109

        (a) A participating dairy operation that fails to pay a required administrative fee or premium payment due upon application to MPP-Dairy or for a calendar year of coverage:

        (1) Remains legally obligated to pay such administrative fee or premium, as applicable; and

        (2) Upon such failure to pay when due after initial approved registration, loses coverage under MPP-Dairy until such administrative fee or premium is paid in full, and once paid, coverage will begin with the next consecutive 2-month period. Failure to pay the premium fee when due will reduce coverage to the catastrophic level for the September and October period and November and December period in that coverage year.

        (b) CCC may take such actions as necessary to collect unpaid administrative fees and premium payments.

        § 1430.110   Calculation of average feed cost and actual dairy production margins.

#### § § 1430.110

        (a) Payments are made to a participating dairy operation as specified in this subpart only when, for a consecutive 2-month period, the calculated average actual dairy production margin is below the coverage level in effect for the participating dairy operation. That margin will be calculated on a national basis and is the amount by which for the relevant consecutive 2-month period, the all milk price exceeds the average feed cost for dairy producers. All calculations will be made on a per cwt basis. The average actual dairy production margin calculation applies to all participating dairy operations. The calculations are not made on an operation by operation basis or on their marketings.

        (b) For calculating the national average feed cost that dairy operations use to produce a cwt of milk, the following three items will be added together:

        (1) The product determined by multiplying 1.0728 by the price of corn per bushel;

        (2) The product determined by multiplying 0.00735 by the price of soybean meal per ton; and

        (3) The product determined by multiplying 0.0137 by the price of alfalfa hay per ton.

        (c) To make those feed calculations, the Deputy Administrator on behalf of CCC will use the following full month data:

        (1) For corn, the full month price received by farmers during the month in the United States as reported in the monthly Agricultural Prices report by USDA NASS;

        (2) For soybean meal, the Central Illinois soybean meal price delivered by rail as reported in the USDA AMS Market News-Monthly; and

        (3) For alfalfa hay, the full month price received during the month by farmers in the United States for alfalfa hay as reported in the monthly Agricultural Prices report by USDA NASS.

        (d) The national average feed cost data for corn, soybean meal, and alfalfa hay used in the calculation of the national average feed cost to determine the actual dairy production margin for the relevant period, will be the data reported in the publication the following month. (For example, preliminary May prices for corn and soybean meal were reported in the May Agricultural Prices publication but full month May prices will be available in the June publication, and those will be the prices used).

        (e) The actual dairy production margin for each consecutive 2-month period, will be calculated by subtracting:

        (1) The average feed cost for that consecutive 2-month period, determined under paragraph (b) of this section; from

        (2) The all-milk price for that consecutive 2-month period.

        § 1430.111   Relation to RMA's LGM-Dairy Program.

#### § § 1430.111

        (a) A producer may participate in either MPP-Dairy through a dairy operation or the LGM-Dairy program operated by RMA, but not both.

        (b) Producers in dairy operations participating in MPP-Dairy must certify at the time of registration and annually during each coverage election period that they will not have an LGM-Dairy policy in effect during the calendar year the dairy operation is requesting coverage.

        (c) A participating dairy operation may be required to provide proof, to the satisfaction of FSA, of the cancellation or expiration of any previous LGM-Dairy policy.

        § 1430.112   Multi-year contract.

#### § § 1430.112

        (a) Participating dairy operations enrolled in MPP-Dairy are enrolled until December 31, 2018. As such, a participating dairy operation is obligated to pay initial and annual administrative fees and applicable premiums each succeeding calendar year following the date the contract is first entered into through December 31, 2018.

        (b) Failure to pay administrative fees and premiums will result in the loss or reduction of coverage, as applicable, and the participating dairy operation remains obligated to pay such administrative fees and premiums as specified in § 1430.109.

        (c) If a participating dairy operation goes out of business as described in § 1430.107(k) before December 31, 2018, the contract will be terminated immediately, except with respect to payments accrued to the benefit of the participating dairy operation under this subpart before such termination.

        § 1430.113   Contract modifications.

#### § § 1430.113

        (a) Producers in a participating dairy operation must notify FSA immediately of any changes that may affect their participation in MPP-Dairy under this subpart. Changes include, but are not limited to death of a producer on the contract, producer joining the operation, producer exiting the operation, relocation of the dairy operation, transfer of shares by sale or other transfer action, or dairy operation reconstitutions as provided in § 1430.114.

        (b) Payment of any outstanding premium or administrative fee for a participating dairy operation must be paid in full before a transfer of shares by sale or any other change in producers on the contract originally submitted to FSA may take effect. Otherwise, producer changes will not be recognized until the following annual election period, and only if at that time all associated premiums and administrative fees from any previous calendar year of coverage have been paid in full.

        § 1430.114   Reconstitutions.

#### § § 1430.114

        (a) A participating dairy operation under this subpart may reorganize or restructure itself in such a way that the constitution or makeup of its operation is reconstituted in another organization framework. However, any participating dairy operation that reorganizes or restructures after enrolling is subject to a review by FSA to determine if the operation was reorganized or restructured for the sole purpose of establishing an alternative production history for a participating dairy operation or was reorganized or restructured to otherwise circumvent any MPP-Dairy provision under this subpart (including the tier system for premiums) or otherwise to prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the program.

        (b) A participating dairy operation that FSA determines has reorganized solely to establish a new production history or to circumvent the determination of applicable fees or premiums based on an established production history determined under this subpart will be considered to have failed to meet MPP-Dairy requirements and, in addition to other sanctions or penalties that may apply, will not be eligible for MPP-Dairy payments.

        (c) Under no circumstance, except as approved by the Deputy Administrator or provided for in these regulations, will the reconstitution or restructure of a participating dairy operation change the determined production history for the operation. The Deputy Administrator may, however, adjust the production history of a participating dairy operation if there is a calculation error or if erroneous information has been supplied by or on behalf of the participating dairy operation.

        § 1430.115   Offsets and withholdings.

#### § § 1430.115

#### § § 1430.204

        (a) A request for benefits or contract application, under this subpart must be submitted on a form as prescribed by the Agency. Contract applications shall be submitted to the FSA office serving the county where the dairy operation is located. Contract applications must be received by FSA by the close of business on the date established by the Deputy Administrator. Contract applications received after such date shall be disapproved.

        (b) The dairy operation requesting MILC benefits must certify the accuracy and truthfulness of the information in their contract application. All information provided is subject to verification by CCC. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of the Department to verify any information provided will result in disapproval.

        (c) Contract applications will be approved by execution by FSA and producer of a MILC. All persons who share in the risk of a dairy operation's total production must sign and certify the contract application.

        § 1430.205   Selection of starting month.

#### § § 1430.205

        (a) A dairy operation that enters into a MILC contract with CCC must designate the starting month for each fiscal year for the calculation of payments and pound limits for the operation. Once a start month is chosen for a fiscal year the corresponding month will be the start month for each subsequent fiscal year unless changed by an affirmative request in writing on a form approved by CCC. The production start month must be selected on or before the 14th of the month before the month for which payment is sought. If such date falls on a weekend, the start month selection must be made on the last business day preceding the weekend. A dairy operation cannot select as the start month for payment a month which:

        (1) Has already begun, except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

        (2) Has already passed; or

        (3) During which no milk production was produced by the dairy operation.

        (b) For FY 2009, if the operation signs its FY 2008 through 2012 MILC contract within 30 days of the beginning of the application period it can pick any preceding FY 2009 month as its start month for that period or can use the normal rule of paragraph (c) of this section to pick the start month.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the start month for a fiscal year may only be

        (1) For the fiscal year in which the contract is submitted, the month the contract is submitted or

        (2) For a fiscal year that has not yet begun, any month, provided that a month may not be selected after the 14th of the preceding month.

        (d) Dairy operations may change the production start month on or before the 14th day of the month previously selected.

        (e) If a change of the production starting month is not made by the dates required by paragraph (d) of this section, the MILC production starting month cannot be changed until the next fiscal year. If the selected MILC production starting month is never modified, it will remain the same throughout the duration of the contract.

        (f) MILC payments will be made consecutively to the dairy operation on a monthly basis after the production starting month has been designated until the earlier of the following:

        (1) Payment quantity is reached in accordance with § 1430.207; or

        (2) The end of the applicable fiscal year.

        (g)(1) MILC production start month selections made during the signup period designated by CCC may be made as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, otherwise MILC production start month selections must be made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If a payment rate is not in effect during the production start month selected by the dairy operation, payments to the dairy operation will be issued based on the next consecutive month with a payment rate in effect following the MILC production start month selected by the dairy operation. Production in months in which the pay formula does not produce a payment will not count against the fiscal year's poundage limit for the operation.

        (2) Dairy operations with MILC production start months that begin with the month a MILC contract is submitted to FSA or that begin with the first month of the fiscal year with an effective payment rate will receive payments made by CCC consecutively on a monthly basis, if otherwise provided for in this part, until the earlier of the following:

        (i) The maximum payment quantity for the fiscal year or month is reached as determined in accordance with § 1430.207 or

        (ii) The end of the applicable fiscal year.

        (h) All producers involved in the dairy operation must agree to the month designated. The dairy operation assumes the risk of not reaching the maximum payment quantity based on the month selected by the dairy operation. Payments will not be issued for past months for the sole purpose of reaching the maximum payment quantity.

        § 1430.206   [Reserved]

#### § § 1430.206

        § 1430.207   Dairy operation payment quantity.

#### § § 1430.207

        (a) The applicant's payment quantity of milk will be determined by CCC, based on the quantity of milk that was produced and commercially marketed by each dairy operation per fiscal year.

        (b) The maximum quantity of eligible production for which dairy operations, per separate and distinct operation, are eligible for payment per fiscal year under this subpart will be:

        (1) 2,400,000 pounds (24,000 cwt.) for FY 2008 (October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008);

        (2) 2,985,000 pounds (29,850 cwt.) for FY 2009 (October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009), FY 2010 (October 1, 2009, through September 30, 2010), FY 2011 (October 1, 2010, through September 30, 2011) and FY 2012 (October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012), provided further an operation may receive payment for September, 2012, marketings only if its pre-September FY 2012 marketings did not exceed 2,400,000 pounds in which case new marketings that would not put the operation's FY 2012 marketings over 2,400,000 pounds will be eligible for payments otherwise permitted in this rule.

        (c) In accordance with these regulations, the Deputy Administrator will determine what is a separate and distinct operation. That decision will be final

        § 1430.208   Payment rate and dairy operation payment.

#### § § 1430.208

        (a) Payments under this subpart may be made to dairy operations when the Boston Class I milk price under the applicable Federal milk marketing order is below $16.94 per cwt. No payments will be made to dairy operations for marketings during the months that the Boston Class I milk price under the applicable milk marketing order is equal to or exceeds $16.94.

        (b) A per-hundredweight payment rate will be determined for the applicable month by:

        (1) Subtracting from $16.94 the Class I milk price per cwt. in Boston;

        (2) Multiplying the difference by 34 percent for marketings during the period beginning on October 1, 2007, and ending on September 30, 2008;

        (3) Multiplying the difference by 45 percent for marketings during the period beginning on October 1, 2008, and ending on August 31, 2012; and

        (4) Multiplying the difference by 34 percent for marketings in September 2012.

        (c) The payment rate as calculated as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be adjusted to compensate for feed prices when the National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost for a month is greater than the levels set in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost per cwt. for each month will be calculated using the same procedures used to calculate the feed components of the estimated price of 16 percent Mixed Dairy Feed per pound noted on page 33 of the USDA monthly Agricultural Prices publication (including the data and factors noted in footnote 4). The payment rate adjustment for Entire Month feed prices will be determined by increasing $16.94 by the percentage that is 45 percent of the percentage by which the National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost exceeds $7.35 per cwt. (except that $7.35 will be $9.50 for September 2012 marketings.)

        (d) Each eligible dairy operation payment will be calculated, as determined by the Secretary, by:

        (1) Converting whole pounds of milk to hundredweight and

        (2) Multiplying the payment rate determined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by the quantity of eligible production marketed by the operation during the applicable month as determined according to § 1430.205 and other provisions of this subpart.

        (3) Payments to dairy operations will be based on calculated payment rates rounded seven places to the right of the decimal.

        (e) Payments under this subpart may be made to a dairy operation only up to the maximum production limitations set in § 1430.207(b) of eligible production per applicable fiscal year.

        (f) Dairy operations receiving benefits under this subpart, will receive earned payments on a monthly basis according to the MILC contract, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the later of production evidence and all supporting documents for the applicable month are received by CCC or the entire month National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost is made available by USDA, as applicable. Payments issued by CCC more than 60 days after the later of all production evidence and supporting documentation are received by CCC or the entire month National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost is made available by USDA, whichever is later, will be subject to prompt payment interest as allowed by law. However, CCC will endeavor where possible to make payments within 60 days of the end of the marketing month.

        § 1430.209   Proof of market loss production.

#### § § 1430.209

        (a) A dairy operation entering into a MILC must, based on instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of each fiscal year designated in the MILC. The dairy operation must also provide proof that the eligible production was commercially marketed during the months beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30, 2012. Evidence of milk production claimed for payment shall be provided to CCC with supporting documentation under paragraph (b) of this section. All information provided is subject to verification, spot check and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing cooperative if deemed necessary by CCC to verify provided information. Refusal to allow a representative of CCC or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a determination of ineligibility for benefits under this subpart.

        (b) Eligible dairy operations marketing milk during the period specified in the MILC shall provide any available supporting documents from all producers in the dairy operation to assist CCC in verifying that the dairy operation produced and marketed milk commercially from the designated starting month and thereafter. Examples of supporting documentation include, but are not limited to: milk marketing payment stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any other documents available to confirm the production and production history of the dairy operation. Producers may also be required to allow CCC to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting documentation requested is not presented to CCC or FSA, the request for MILC benefits will be disapproved.

#### § § 1430.213

        (a) A dairy operation receiving MILC benefits may reorganize or restructure such that the constitution or makeup of its operation is reconstituted in another organizational framework. However, any operation that reorganizes or restructures after October 1, 2007, is subject to a review by FSA to determine if the operation was reorganized or restructured for the sole purpose of receiving multiple or additional MILC payments.

        (b) A dairy operation that FSA determines has reorganized solely to receive additional MILC payments will be in violation of its contract and dealt in accordance with § 1430.214.

        (c) If during the contract period a change in the dairy operation occurs, the modification to the MILC will not take effect until the first day of the fiscal year following the month FSA received notification of the changes. Changes include but are not limited to any producer affiliated with a dairy operation that has an approved MILC with CCC forming a new dairy operation that is not formed solely to receive additional MILC payments.

        (d) Changes resulting in the following will take effect immediately upon notification to CCC, in accordance with § 1430.212:

        (1) Increases or reductions of shareholders or producers and their corresponding share amounts in the dairy operation; or

        (2) Purchases of a new dairy operation by a producer or producers not affiliated with an existing dairy operation that has an approved MILC with CCC.

#### § § 1430.214

        (a) If producers in a dairy operation violates the MILC or the requirements of this subpart, CCC may:

        (1) Terminate the MILC for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the violation occurs, and allow the producer to retain any payments received under the contract; or

        (2) Allow the MILC to remain in effect and require the producer to repay a portion of the payments received commensurate with the violation's severity, as CCC determines.

        (3) If the MILC is terminated under this section, the participant shall forfeit all rights to further MILC benefits and shall refund all or part of the payments received as CCC determines appropriate.

        (4) A producer or operation with a violation, as determined by CCC, shall refund all MILC funds disbursed under of this part. The remedies provided in this subpart shall be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may apply.

        (b) A MILC is violated by the following actions:

        (3) Provide proof of milk production marketed commercially by all persons in the dairy operation to establish production history;

        (4) Pay required administrative fees for participation in DMC as specified in this subpart and any premiums, if applicable, as specified in this subpart.

        (b) A person or entity covered by § 1400.401 of this chapter (hereafter “foreign person”) must meet the eligibility requirements in that section to receive payments under this subpart.

Also, the Deputy Administrator may require operations to be combined and considered one operation when there is close interest by family or otherwise between two operations, to avoid schemes or devices, or otherwise. Likewise, the Deputy Administrator may consider other factors as are deemed appropriate to adjust what is considered a dairy operation to conform with the DMC Program requirements in an equitable manner, including taking into account a dairy's status under MPP-Dairy and the Milk Income Loss Contract Program formerly operated under this part.

        (f) Dairy operation eligibility for adjusted based production history requires the dairy operation to be enrolled in DMC for the applicable calendar year. Dairy operations with less than 5 million pounds of DMC production history are eligible for adjusted based production history.

        § 1430.404   Time and method of registration and annual election.

#### § § 1430.404

        (a) A dairy operation may register to participate in DMC by establishing a production history and, if eligible, adjusted base    production history, according to § 1430.405 on a form prescribed by CCC and also submitting a contract prescribed by CCC. Dairy operations may obtain a contract in person, by mail, or by facsimile from any FSA county office. In addition, dairy operations may download a copy of the forms at

        (b) A dairy operation must submit completed contracts and any other supporting documentation, during the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator, to the administrative county FSA office serving the dairy operation. However, the production history must be established only once and approved by CCC before the contract is submitted and considered complete. Dairy operations with less than 5 million pounds of production may make a one-time adjustment to production history based on a prescribed formula using actual 2019 milk marketings according to § 1430.405(a)(3), during the 2024 annual coverage election period. Once the adjusted base production history is established, that history will be permanent, will be used in place of previously established production history, and will be subject to coverage elections made by the dairy operation under the lock-in option according to § 1430.407(j) or made by the dairy operation in subsequent annual coverage year enrollments.

        (1) A new dairy operation that has been established after the most recent election period is required to submit a contract within the first 60 calendar days from the date of which the dairy operation first commercially markets milk and may elect coverage that begins the month and day the dairy operation has commercial marketings.

        (2) A new dairy operation that does not meet the 60-day requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot enroll until the next annual election period for coverage for the following calendar year.

        (c) Annual contracts with coverage elections are to be submitted in time to be received at FSA by the close of business on the last day of the annual election period, established by the Deputy Administrator.

        (1) The applicable year of coverage for contracts received during an annual election period will be the following calendar year, except for 2019 and 2024, where the election and coverage year will be the same, or unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs. Coverage for dairy operations that register during the 2019 election period will be retroactive to January 1, 2019. Coverage for dairy operations that are approved for 2024 DMC enrollment will receive any applicable payments triggered after January 1, 2024.

        (2) Annual contracts with coverage elections submitted after the applicable allowed time for submission will not be considered.

        (d) If the dairy producer operates more than one separate and distinct operation, the producer must register each operation for each operation to be eligible for coverage. If the producer moves the same herd of cattle between two facilities, then the two facilities will not be regarded as separate and distinct but as one operation unless the Deputy Administrator determines otherwise. A separate operation must distinctly, as a single unit, have their own cattle, facilities, milk marketings, tanks, feed, records, State level licenses, and permits. All new dairy operations that did not participate in MPP-Dairy must meet all the requirements of this paragraph. A participating dairy operation in business prior to January 1, 2019, that participated in MPP-Dairy will automatically be determined as a “dairy operation” for DMC Program purposes in the same manner as under MPP-Dairy. In disputes regarding separate dairy operations the Deputy Administrator will determine what is a separate and distinct operation and that decision will be final. A dairy operation operated by more than one dairy producer will be treated as a single dairy operation for purposes of participating in DMC and may only, submit one contract. Only participating dairy operations enrolling using contract forms approved by CCC will be covered by the DMC Program.

        (e) A participating dairy operation must elect, during the applicable annual election period and by using the form prescribed by CCC, the coverage level threshold and coverage percentage for that participating dairy operation for the applicable calendar year:

        (1) Once the registration for a calendar year of coverage is submitted and approved by CCC, coverage for subsequent years does not automatically carry forward. For each calendar year, a dairy operation that decides to participate in DMC must register for a calendar year of coverage according to this paragraph (e) during the applicable coverage election period, except as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;

        (2) During the 2019 annual coverage election period only, participating dairy operations that make a one-time election of coverage level and percentage of coverage, according to § 1430.407(j), will be locked in at the same coverage level and percentage of coverage for a 5-year period beginning January 1, 2019, and ending December 31, 2023. During the annual coverage election period, dairy operations that elected that lock-in option must choose to remain locked in at the same coverage level and percentage of coverage for an additional year, ending December 31, 2024, or opt out of lock-in coverage for coverage year 2024. Dairy operations that elect the lock-in option are required to pay the annual administrative fee and submit an annual contract during the annual contract election period for each coverage year to certify that the dairy operation is still in the business of producing and commercially marketing milk. If the operation fails to pay the applicable administrative fees or certify the status of the dairy operation, the dairy operation will remain obligated for all applicable unpaid administrative and premium fees calculated for the lock-in period.

        (3) All participating producers in the participating dairy operation must agree to the coverage level threshold and coverage percentage elected by the operation on the contract. Producers in the participating dairy operation that elect not to participate may not submit a separate contract for coverage. All producers that share in risk of the dairy operations production must be indicated on the contract with their corresponding share in the dairy operation, however, a signature from the non-participating member will not be required for CCC approval.

        (4) During the 2021 special enrollment period only, for participating dairy operations that had a succession-in-interest occur from January 2, 2021, through the opening of special enrollment, for supplemental production history to be applicable to such successors, the predecessor must first establish supplemental production history. For successions-in-interest when the successor establishes supplemental production history before the predecessor, the successor's supplemental production history will be applicable for 2022.

        (f) By registering to participate or receive payment under DMC, all participating producers in the dairy operation must certify to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information in their applications and supporting documentation.

        (1) All participating producers who share in the risk of a dairy operation's production must sign and certify all submissions made under DMC that relate to the level of coverage and marketed production for the dairy operation.

        (2) All information provided is subject to verification by FSA. FSA may require a dairy operation to provide documentation that supports all verifiable records. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without such information DMC Program benefits will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Federal Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties or sanctions.

        (g) At the time the completed contract is submitted to FSA for the first program year in which the operation is to participate in DMC, the dairy operation must also submit a separate form, as prescribed by CCC, to establish the production history for the dairy operation. An established production history and a completed contract are both required to have a complete submission that is subject to approval by FSA. Production histories established for dairy operations under MPP-Dairy will be used in the DMC Program. A new production history will only be established for new dairy operations that did not participate in MPP-Dairy.

        (h) In addition to meeting requirements in paragraph (g) of this section, the dairy operation must submit a separate form as prescribed by CCC to establish the adjusted base production history for the dairy operation, if applicable, to complete a submission.

        § 1430.405   Establishment and transfer of production history for a participating dairy operation.

#### § § 1430.405

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, FSA will establish the production history for a dairy operation for DMC as the highest annual milk marketings of the participating dairy operation during any one of the 2011, 2012, or 2013 calendar years, and will establish an adjusted base production history, if applicable.

        (1) Producers in the participating dairy operation are required to provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's quantity of milk commercially marketed, to establish the production history and or adjusted base production history for the dairy operation.

        (2) All information provided is subject to verification, spot check, and audit by FSA. If the dairy operation does not provide, to the satisfaction of FSA, documentation requested to substantiate the production history of the highest annual milk marketings or 2019 milk marketings for the participating dairy operation, then the registration will not be approved.

        (3) A participating dairy operation may establish supplemental production history during the coverage election period preceding the coverage year, except for 2021 when a special enrollment will occur. To determine supplemental production history, the dairy operation production history established according to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section must be subtracted from that dairy operation's actual pounds of 2019 milk production as indicated on the milk marketing statement, with the result multiplied by 75 percent. Supplemental production history may not be established after the 2023 coverage year.

        (4) A participating dairy operation with production of less than 5 million pounds may establish adjusted base production history during the coverage election period beginning with the 2024 coverage year. To determine adjusted base production history, the dairy operation production history established according to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, and as previously adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section, if applicable, must be subtracted from that dairy operation's actual pounds of 2019 milk production as indicated on the milk marketing statement, with the result multiplied by 75 percent, and then added to the previously established production history. If the new adjusted base production history for a lock-in contract in coverage year 2024 exceeds the maximum 5 million pounds that can be covered under Tier 1, according to § 1430.407(d), the excess pounds above 5 million pounds will be enrolled in Tier 2 at the $4.00 Catastrophic level coverage. If the new adjusted base production history for an annual contract exceeds the maximum 5 million pounds that can be covered under Tier 1, the excess pounds above 5 million pounds will be enrolled according to the coverage elections on the annual contract.

        (b) A participating dairy operation that was not in operation prior to January 1, 2014, that has not established a production history will elect the highest annual milk marketings during any one calendar year while in operation to determine the production history of the participating dairy operation.

        (c) A participating dairy operation with less than one year of production history will be considered a new dairy operation. To establish the production history for such a new dairy operation the new dairy operation is required to elect one of the following methods:

        (1) The volume of the actual milk marketings for the months the dairy operation has been in operation, extrapolated to a yearly amount based on a national seasonally adjusted index, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, to account for differences in milk production during the year; or

        (2) An estimate of the actual milk marketings of the dairy operation based on the herd size of the dairy operation relative to the national rolling herd average data published by the Secretary.

        (d) If FSA determines that the new enterprise was formed for the purpose of circumventing DMC provisions, including, but not limited to, reconstituting a dairy operation to receive additional benefits, or establishing new production history, that enterprise will not be considered a new dairy operation for the purpose of establishing production history.

        (e) Once the production history of a participating dairy operation is established under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the production history will be adjusted by a one-time upward adjustment by FSA to reflect any increase in the national average milk production relative to calendar year 2017, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. Dairy operations participating in DMC, that had production history previously established under MPP-Dairy but elected not to participate in MPP-Dairy are not eligible for the production history adjustment. Dairy operations with approved contracts for 2018 coverage under MPP-Dairy will maintain that same production history, as in the DMC Program and are not eligible for the production history adjustment. New dairy operations that participate in DMC, that did not previously have their production history established nor participate in MPP-Dairy, will have the same adjustment factor of 1.0186 applied to their established production history for registration in the DMC Program as 2018 MPP-Dairy participants. There will be no further adjustments in subsequent years of participation made to the established production history under the DMC Program.

        (f) The production history or adjusted base production history must be transferred from one dairy facility to another as follows:

        (1) Producers of a dairy operation relocate the dairy operation to another location and the production history and or adjusted base production history, if applicable, of the original operation must be transferred to the new location and subject to the same elected coverage levels for that year; or

        (2) Producers of a dairy operation transfer ownership of a dairy operation with its associated production history and or adjusted base production history, if applicable, through a succession-in-interest transfer when there is a spouse, child, heir, or common member that the dairy operation is being transferred to and there is no break in the continuity of the dairy operation. However, the successor operation must submit a separate registration according to § 1430.404, to participate in DMC, but will be subject to the same elected coverage levels made by the predecessor for that coverage year or lock-in period, as applicable.

        (g) If CCC waives the obligation, under DMC of a participating dairy operation due to death or retirement of the producer or of the permanent dissolution of the dairy operation or under other circumstances as determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA may reestablish the production history and adjusted base production history, if applicable.

        (h) The established production history of a participating dairy operation may be adjusted upward once during the term of the contract for an intergenerational transfer based on the purchase of additional cows by the new family member(s). The increase in the established production history of the participating dairy operation will be determined on the basis of the national rolling herd average data for the current year in effect at the time of the intergenerational transfer and the quantity of the production history increase will be limited to an amount not more than 5 million pounds. The additional quantity of production history will receive coverage at the same elected coverage threshold and coverage percentage in effect for the participating dairy operation at the time the production history increase takes effect. Intergenerational transfers will not be allowed if the participating dairy operation's current annual production and the increase in herd size by the new member(s) is less than the operation's established production history.

        (1) The dairy operation must notify FSA, using the appropriate CCC form(s), of the intergenerational transfer within 60 days of the purchase of the cows, except that for purchases made for intergenerational transfers occurring in 2019 before the 2019 annual coverage election period, the dairy operation must notify FSA during the registration and annual coverage election period for coverage year 2019, established by the Deputy Administrator. The operation has the option of the additional production history taking effect beginning with the month the producer first began to commercially produce and market milk as part of the dairy operation, or the following January 1. If the additional production history takes effect between January 1 and August 31, the premium is due September 1, as specified in § 1430.407(h)(2). If the additional production history takes effect between September 1 and December 31, the premium is due immediately.

        (2) All of the items specified in this paragraph must be documented in the notification to FSA and self-certified by the current and new member(s) for the intergenerational transfer to be considered eligible for additional production history. All of the following information is subject to verification by CCC. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of USDA to verify any information provided will result in disapproval of the intergenerational transfer.

        (i) Documentation that the new member(s) joining the operation has purchased the dairy cows being added to the dairy operation;

        (ii) Certification that each new member will have a share of the profits or losses from the dairy operation commensurate with such person's contributions to the dairy operation;

        (iii) Certification that each new member has a significant equity ownership in the participating dairy operation at levels determined by the Deputy Administrator and announced on the FSA website,

        (iv) Certification that each new member is a lineal descendant or spouse of a current member of the participating dairy operation;

        (v) Agreement that each new member will contribute labor in the dairy operation at a minimum of 35 hours per week or have a plan for transition to full-time, subject to FSA county committee review and approval, if only working seasonally or part-time;

        (vi) Certification that the dairy operation will be the principal source of non-investment earned income for each new member; and

        (vii) Documentation of the participating dairy operation's current annual marketings as of the date of the intergenerational transfer.

        § 1430.406   Administrative fees.

#### § § 1430.406

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, dairy operations must pay an administrative fee to CCC in the amount of $100 at the time of enrollment during the annual election period for each applicable coverage year the dairy operation decides to participate in DMC. Annual administrative fees are due and payable to CCC through the administrative county FSA office no later than the close of business on the last day of the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator for each applicable calendar year of dairy margin coverage under DMC. The administrative fee paid is non-refundable.

        (b) The required annual administrative fee is per dairy operation. Therefore, multiple dairy producers in a single participating dairy operation are required to pay only one annual administrative fee for the participating dairy operation. Conversely, in the case of a dairy producer that operates more than one dairy operation, each participating dairy operation is required to pay a separate administrative fee annually.

        (c) Dairy operations that lock-in coverage according to § 1430.407(j), are required to pay the administrative fee each year through 2024, except as provided in paragraph (e) in this section.

        (d) Failure to pay the administrative fee timely will result in loss of dairy margin coverage for the applicable calendar year.

        (e) A limited resource, beginning, veteran, or socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher, as defined in § 1430.402, will be exempt from paying the administrative fee in this section. The administrative fee waiver for the DMC Program for socially disadvantaged, beginning, and limited resource farmers and ranchers must be requested on a form specified by FSA and must accompany the contract application for coverage under this part in the administrative county FSA office.

        § 1430.407   Buy-up coverage.

#### § § 1430.407

        (a) For purposes of receiving buy-up dairy margin coverage, a participating dairy operation may annually elect, except as provided by paragraph (i) of this section, during an annual election period the following for the applicable calendar year:

        (1) A coverage level threshold for margins that, per cwt, is equal to one of the following: $4.50, $5, $5.50, $6, $6.50, $7, $7.50, $8, $8.50. $9, or $9.50; and

        (2) A percentage of coverage for the production history or adjusted base production history from 5 percent to 95 percent, in 5 percent increments.

        (b) In the absence of any such election, the applicable coverage level provided, with no premium due, is catastrophic level coverage.

        (c) A participating dairy operation that elects margin protection coverage above $4 is required to pay an annual premium based on coverage level and covered production history in addition to the administrative fee. Tier 1 applies to covered production history up to and including 5 million pounds; Tier 2 applies to covered production history above 5 million pounds.

        (d) A participating dairy operation may only select one coverage level threshold and only one percentage of coverage applicable to both Tier 1 and Tier 2. However, a participating dairy operation that elects a coverage level threshold of $8.50, $9, or $9.50, according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on the dairy operation's first 5 million pounds of production history under Tier 1, must choose a different coverage level threshold that is equal to $4, $4.50, $5, $5.50, $6, $6.50, $7, $7.50, $8 to apply to production history in excess of 5 million pounds included in the covered production under Tier 2 elected by the participating dairy operation.

        (e) The premium per cwt of milk, based on the elected percentage of coverage of production history is specified in the following table:

        (f) The annual premium due for a participating dairy operation is calculated for production history or adjusted base production history, as applicable, by multiplying:

        (1) The covered production history or adjusted base production history; and

        (2) The premium per cwt of milk specified in paragraph (e) of this section for the coverage level elected in paragraph (d) of this section by the dairy operation.

        (g) In the case of a new dairy operation that first registers to participate in DMC for a calendar year after the start of the calendar year, the participating dairy operation is required to pay a pro-rated premium for that calendar year based on the portion of the calendar year for which the participating dairy operation is eligible, and for which it purchases the coverage.

        (h) A participating dairy operation is required to pay the annual premium in total as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for the applicable calendar year, at time of submission of coverage election to FSA; but no later than September 1 of the applicable calendar year of coverage, unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator.

        (i) If the total premium is not paid for an applicable calendar year of coverage as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the participating dairy operation will lose coverage until such time as the premium has been fully paid.

        (j) For each calendar year 2019 through 2023, a participating dairy operation that makes a one-time election of a coverage level threshold and a percentage of coverage according to this section, for a 5-year period, will have their elected coverage level, as applicable to each tier, reduced by 25 percent. The option to lock in for the premium rate discount must be elected during the 2019 annual coverage election period announced by FSA. Except that, new dairy operations, not in existence during the 2019 annual election period, that elect to participate in DMC according to § 1430.404(b), are eligible to receive the premium rate discount for locking coverage for the period beginning with the first available calendar year and ending in 2023, except that new dairy operations registering for DMC for the first time for coverage year 2023 and dairy operations that stop producing and marketing milk in 2019 that are registering for eligible months in 2019 are not eligible for the multi-year premium rate discount. All dairy operations that elect the lock-in option are subject to full participation in the DMC Program at the same elected premium coverage levels and calculated premium for the duration of DMC according to § 1430.413. Participating dairy operations that received the premium rate discount during the 2023 calendar year of coverage are eligible to receive the premium rate discount for calendar year 2024, unless the dairy operation opts-out of lock-in coverage for 2024 according to § 1430.404(e)(2).

        (k) Annual premium balances due to CCC from a participating dairy operation for a calendar year of coverage must be paid in full no later than September 1 of the applicable calendar year or within a grace period determined by the Deputy Administrator, if applicable.

        (l) The Deputy Administrator may waive the obligation to pay the premium, or refund the premium paid, of a participating dairy operation for a calendar year, for death, retirement, permanent dissolution of a participating dairy operation, or other circumstances determined by the Deputy Administrator. In these instances, the contract will be terminated immediately, except with respect to payments accrued to the benefit of the participating dairy operation under this subpart before such termination.

        (m) DMC administrative fees and premiums are required to be paid by a negotiable instrument satisfactory to FSA and made payable to CCC and either mailed to or provided in person to the administrative county office or other location designated by FSA.

        (n) The premium rate for adjusted base production history eligible under a lock-in contract maintains the 25 percent discounted rate according to paragraph (j) of this section.

        § 1430.408   MPP-Dairy premium repayments.

#### § § 1430.408

        (a) A dairy operation that participated in MPP-Dairy during any of calendar years 2014 through 2017 may receive a repayment in an amount equal to the difference between the total amount of premiums paid by the dairy operation for each applicable calendar year of coverage and the total amount of payments made to the MPP-Dairy participating dairy operation for that applicable calendar year.

        (b) FSA will determine the calculated repayment amounts for each year for each dairy operation that participated in MPP-Dairy during the years of 2014 through 2017.

        (1) Coverage years in which the payments exceeded premiums paid for that coverage year will yield a $0 calculation for that calendar year.

        (2) Dairy operations must provide adequate proof, to the satisfaction of FSA, for calculated repayment amounts in dispute.

        (c) Qualifying dairy operations according to paragraph (a) of this section, must elect on a form prescribed by CCC, to receive the repayment in either an amount that is equal to the following:

        (1) 75 percent of the calculated repayment as a credit that may be used by the dairy operation towards DMC premiums; or

        (2) 50 percent of the calculated repayment as a direct cash repayment.

        (d) Dairy operations may transfer their premium repayment election choice in paragraph (c) of this section to a dairy operation that succeeded to the dairy operation through a succession-in-interest transfer under MPP-Dairy. However, the dairy operation to which the election choice is being transferred to must be participating in the DMC Program if the credit option is elected according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Otherwise, their credit repayment election is not transferrable. Dairy operations that give up their right to elect a premium repayment option by designation of such on a form prescribed by CCC are not eligible to receive a cash or credit benefit, in full or partially, for premiums paid under MPP-Dairy.

        (e) A dairy operation that elects the credit option can only use the credit in the DMC Program. If the entire credit is not used, for any reason, it cannot be applied as a credit to any other USDA program and will have zero cash value that cannot be redeemed for any purpose.

        (f) A dairy operation that elects the cash repayment option will have the repayment issued only in the name of the dairy operation entity as it existed in MPP-Dairy.

        (g) A dairy operation must choose their MPP-Dairy premium repayment option on a form prescribed by CCC during a period specified by FSA. Once the premium repayment choice of credit or cash is made by the dairy operation and approved by FSA, that choice cannot be changed.

        § 1430.409   Dairy margin coverage payments.

#### § § 1430.409

        (a) A DMC payment will be made to a participating dairy operation for any month when the average actual dairy production margin for that month falls below the coverage level threshold in effect for the participating dairy operation.

        (b) Payments trigger at the catastrophic level or at the buy-up level; the payments will be calculated according to this paragraph. If the dairy operation only has catastrophic coverage or buy-up coverage at 95 percent, there will be a single calculation. If the dairy operation purchased buy-up coverage at less than 95 percent and the catastrophic level also triggers a payment, then there will be two calculations to determine the payment—first the calculation for the buy-up coverage percentage and then the calculation for the catastrophic level percentage, which is the balance of the established production history up to 95 percent; the result of these two calculations will be added together to determine the payment amount. Each calculation multiplies the payment rate times the coverage percentage times the production history or established adjusted base production history divided by 12 as follows:

        (1)  The amount by which the coverage level exceeds the average actual dairy production margin for a month;

        (2)  The coverage percentage; and

        (3)  The production history or established adjusted base production history or adjusted base production history of the dairy operation, divided by 12.

        (c) If the dairy operation purchased buy-up level coverage at less than 95 percent of production history or adjusted base production history, then the dairy operation will receive a payment calculated at the buy-up level, plus the payment at the catastrophic level, if triggered, for the balance of 95 percent of its established production history or adjusted base production history. For example, if a producer purchased buy-up coverage at the 50 percent level, then that producer will also receive catastrophic level coverage for the next 45 percent for total coverage of 95 percent.

        § 1430.410   Effect of failure to pay administrative fees or premiums.

#### § § 1430.410

        (a) A participating dairy operation that fails to pay a required administrative fee or premium payment due upon application to DMC or for a calendar year of coverage:

        (1) Remains legally obligated to pay such administrative fee or premium, as applicable; and

        (2) Upon such failure to pay when due, loses coverage under DMC until such administrative fee or premium is paid in full, and once paid, coverage will be reinstated beginning with the month coverage was lost.

        (b) CCC may take such actions as necessary to collect unpaid administrative fees and premium payments.

        § 1430.411   Calculation of average feed cost and actual dairy production margins.

#### § § 1430.411

        (a) Payments are made to a participating dairy operation as specified in this subpart only when the calculated average actual dairy production margin for a month is below the coverage level in effect for the participating dairy operation. That margin will be calculated on a national basis and is the amount by which for the relevant month, the all milk price exceeds the average feed cost for dairy producers. The average actual dairy production margin calculation applies to all participating dairy operations. The calculations are not made on an operation by operation basis or on their marketings.

        (b) For calculating the national average feed cost that dairy operations use to produce a cwt of milk, the following three items will be added together:

        (1) The product determined by multiplying 1.0728 by the price of corn per bushel;

        (2) The product determined by multiplying 0.00735 by the price of soybean meal per ton; and

        (3) The product determined by multiplying 0.0137 by the price of alfalfa hay per ton.

        (c) To make those feed calculations, the Deputy Administrator on behalf of CCC will use the following full month data:

        (1) For corn, the full month price received by farmers during the month in the United States as reported in the monthly Agricultural Prices report by USDA NASS;

        (2) For soybean meal, the Central Illinois soybean meal price delivered by rail as reported in the USDA AMS Market News-Monthly; and

        (3) For alfalfa hay, the full month price received during the month by farmers in the United States for high quality (premium and supreme) alfalfa hay as reported in the monthly Agricultural Prices report by USDA NASS will be used to calculate the hay price.

        (d) The national average feed cost data for corn, soybean meal, and alfalfa hay used in the calculation of the national average feed cost to determine the actual dairy production margin for the relevant period, will be the data reported in the publication the following month. (For example, full month May prices will be available in the June publication, and those will be the prices used).

        (e) The actual dairy production margin for each month, will be calculated by subtracting:

        (1) The average feed cost for that month, determined under paragraph (b) of this section; from

        (2) The all-milk price for that same month.

#### § § 1430.413

        (a) Participating dairy operations enrolled in DMC according to § 1430.407(j) are registered through December 31, 2023. As such, a participating dairy operation is obligated to pay applicable administrative fees and applicable premiums each succeeding calendar year following the date the contract is first entered into through December 31, 2023. Likewise, any successor to the dairy operation with lock-in coverage will be bound to the same coverage elections made by the predecessor and applicable premiums for the duration of the lock-in period.

        (b) A participating dairy operation under a lock-in option that fails to pay applicable administrative fees and premiums no later than September 1 of the applicable calendar year of coverage year of the lock-in will remain obligated to pay such applicable administrative fees and premiums as specified in § 1430.410.

        (c) If a participating dairy operation goes out of business as described in § 1430.407(l) before the end of the lock-in period, the contract will be terminated immediately, except with respect to payments accrued to the benefit of the participating dairy operation under this subpart before such termination.

        (d) For 2024 DMC coverage, participating dairy operations with lock-in coverage in 2023 are eligible to extend lock-in coverage for coverage year 2024.

        (a) Producers in a participating dairy operation must notify FSA immediately of any changes that may affect their participation in DMC. Changes include, but are not limited to, death of a producer who is on the contract, producer joining the operation, producer exiting the operation, relocation of the dairy operation, transfer of shares by sale or other transfer action, or dairy operation reconstitutions as provided in § 1430.415.

        (b) Payment of any outstanding premium or administrative fee for a participating dairy operation must be paid in full before a transfer of shares by sale or any other change in producers on the contract originally submitted to FSA may take effect. Otherwise, producer changes will not be recognized until the following annual election period, and only if at that time all associated premiums and administrative fees from any previous calendar year of coverage have been paid in full.

        § 1430.415   Reconstitutions.

#### § § 1430.415

        (a) Any participating dairy operation that reorganizes or restructures after enrollment is subject to a review by FSA to determine if the operation was reorganized or restructured for the sole purpose of establishing an alternative production history for a participating dairy operation or was reorganized or restructured to otherwise circumvent any DMC Program provision under this subpart (including the tier system for premiums) or otherwise to prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the DMC Program.

        (b) A participating dairy operation that FSA determines has reorganized solely to establish a new production history or to circumvent the determination of applicable fees or premiums based on an established production history determined under this subpart will be considered to have failed to meet the DMC Program requirements and, in addition to other sanctions or penalties that may apply, will not be eligible for DMC payments.

        (c) Under no circumstance, except as approved by the Deputy Administrator or provided for in these regulations, will the reconstitution or restructure of a participating dairy operation change the determined production history for the operation. The Deputy Administrator may, however, adjust the production history of a participating dairy operation if there is a calculation error or if erroneous information has been supplied by or on behalf of the participating dairy operation.

        § 1430.416   Offsets and withholdings.

If the honey located in a farm storage structure is pledged as collateral that secures more than one loan, the honey must be segregated so as to preserve the identity of the honey securing such loan. Honey securing a loan must also be segregated from any honey not pledged as collateral for a loan that is stored in the same structure.

      (b) Producers may also obtain loans on honey packed in eligible containers and stored in facilities owned by third parties in which the honey of more than one person is stored if the honey that is to be pledged as collateral for a loan and that is stored identity preserved or is segregated from all other honey.

      § 1434.10   Application, availability, disbursement, and maturity.

#### § § 1434.10

      (a) A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request MALs and LDPs at the appropriate FSA county office responsible for administering the program as provided under part 718 of this title. To receive MALs and LDPs for honey, a producer must execute a note and security agreement or LDP application on or before March 31 of the year following the year in which the honey was extracted.

      (b) A producer must request a loan at the county office of the county where the honey is stored if the honey is stored at the producer's farm. A producer who requests a loan on honey stored in eligible storage other than the producer's farm, may request loans at either the county office of the county where the storage facility is located or at the county office of the county where the producer's main place of business is located. A CMA must request loans at the county office for the county in which the principal office of the CMA is located unless the State committee designates another county office. If the CMA has operations in two or more States, the CMA must file its loan applications at the county office for the county in which its principal office for each State is located.

      (c) MALs will be made on the honey as declared and certified by the producer in the manner specified by CCC at the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a MAL. The producer is also required to declare and certify the class of honey (table or non-table) and floral source of the honey in the manner specified by CCC when the honey is pledged as collateral for a MAL.

      (d) The request for a loan will not be approved until all producers having an interest in the honey sign the note and security agreement and CCC approves such note and security agreement. The disbursement of loans will be made by county offices on behalf of CCC, for honey that:

      (1) Has been extracted;

      (2) Is in eligible storage; and

      (3) Has not been blended or mixed with ineligible honey.

      (e) MALs mature on demand, but not later than the last day of the ninth calendar month following the month in which the note and security agreement was approved.

      (1) When the maturity date falls on a non-workday for county offices, CCC will extend the final date to the next workday. Before the date specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a producer may re-offer as MAL collateral any eligible honey that has been offered previously for a MAL if the previous MAL has been repaid at principal plus interest only.

      (2) The maturity date of any MAL may not be extended.

      (f) If, after a loan is made, CCC determines that the producer or the honey collateral is not in compliance with any of the provisions of this part, the producer must refund the total amount disbursed under loan and charges plus interest, including late payment interest as provided in part 1403 of this title.

      § 1434.12   Liens.

#### § § 1434.12

      (a) CCC's security interest in the honey pledged as collateral is first and superior to all other security interests.

      (b) The county office will file or record, as required by State law, all financing statements needed to perfect a security interest in honey pledged as collateral for a loan. The cost of filing and recording will be for the account of CCC.

      (c) If there are any other security interests, liens, or encumbrances on the honey, CCC will obtain waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC even though the security interests, liens, or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional security interests, liens, or encumbrances will be placed on the honey after the loan is approved.

      § 1434.13   Transfer of producer's interest prohibited.

#### § § 1434.13

      Absent written approval from CCC, the producer may not transfer either the remaining interest in, or right to redeem, the honey pledged as collateral for a MAL on honey nor may anyone acquire such interest or right. Subject to the provisions of § 1434.17, a producer who wishes to liquidate all or part of a MAL by contracting for the sale of the honey must obtain written approval from the county office on a form prescribed by CCC to remove a specified quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval will be subject to the terms and conditions in the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the FSA county office.

      (1) By signing the MAL note and security agreement, the producer must:

      (i) Provide correct, accurate, and truthful certifications and representations of the loan quantity and all other matters of fact and interest; and

      (ii) Not remove or dispose of any amount of the loan quantity without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with this section.

      (2) That violation of the terms and conditions of this part and the MAL note and security agreement will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer for a MAL quantity that is not actually in existence or for a quantity for which the producer is not eligible.

      (b) For the purposes of this section, violations include any failure to comply with this part or the loan agreement, including but not limited to any incorrect certification or:

      (1) Unauthorized removal of honey, which includes, but is not limited to, the movement of any loan quantity of honey from the storage structure in the commodity was stored when the loan was approved to any other storage structure whether or not such structure is located on the producer's farm without prior written authorization from the county committee in accordance with § 1434.14;

      (2) Any unauthorized disposition, which includes, but is not limited to, the conversion of any loan quantity pledged as collateral for a loan without prior written authorization from the county committee in accordance with this section.

      (c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for conduct that is in violation of this section. Accordingly, if the county committee determines that the producer has engaged in any such violation, liquidated damages will be assessed in addition to any loan refund and other charges that may be due. The amount of such damages will be computed using the quantity of honey that is involved in the violation and the following formula. If CCC determines the producer:

      (1) Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note for each offense.

      (2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note.

      (d) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the county committee will:

      (1) Require repayment of the loan principal applicable to the loan quantity involved in the violation plus charges and interest; and

      (2) If the producer fails to pay such amount within 30 calendar days from the date of notification, call the applicable loan for all of the honey under loan, plus charges and interest.

      (e) For liquidated damages assessed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the county committee will call the loan involved in the violation, and charges plus interest.

      (f) The county committee:

      (1) May waive the administrative actions taken in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section if the county committee determines that:

      (i) The violation occurred inadvertently, accidentally, or unintentionally; or

      (ii) The producer acted to prevent spoilage of the commodity.

      (2) Will not consider the following acts as inadvertent, accidental, or unintentional:

      (i) Movement of loan collateral off the farm;

      (ii) Movement of loan collateral from one storage structure to another on the farm; and (iii) Consumption of loan collateral.

      (g) If there is any violation of the loan agreement or this part, the loan may be terminated in which case there must be a full refund of the loan plus interest and costs.

      (h) If the county committee determines that the producer has violated this part or the loan agreement, the county committee will notify the producer in writing that:

      (1) The producer has 30 calendar days to provide evidence and information regarding the circumstances that caused the violation, to the county committee, and

      (2) Administrative actions will be taken in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.

      (i) Makes any fraudulent or misleading representation in obtaining a loan, maintaining, or settling a loan; or

      (ii) Disposes or moves the loan collateral without the approval of CCC, such loan shall become payable upon demand by CCC. The producer is liable for:

      (A) The amount of the loan;

      (B) Any additional amounts paid by CCC with respect to the loan;

      (C) All other costs that CCC would not have incurred but for the fraudulent representation, the unauthorized disposition or movement of the loan collateral;

      (D) Interest on such amounts;

      (E) Late payment interest as may be provided for in part 1403 of this title; and

      (F) Liquidated damages assessed under paragraph (c) of this section; and

      (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of the note and security agreement, if a producer has made any such fraudulent or misleading representation to CCC or if the producer has disposed of, or moved, the loan collateral without prior written approval from CCC in accordance with this section, the value of the settlement for such collateral removed by CCC is determined by CCC according to this section.

      (j) A producer is personally liable for any damages resulting from honey removed by CCC, containing mercurial compounds or other substances poisonous to humans, animals, or food commodities that are contaminated.

      (k) If the amount disbursed under a loan or in settlement thereof exceeds the amount authorized under this part, the producer is personally liable for repayment of such excess and charges, plus interest, and for any other sanction as may be allowed by law.

      (l) If the amount collected from the producer in satisfaction of the loan is less than the amount required in accordance with this part, the producer is personally liable for repayment of the amount of such deficiency and charges, plus interest.

      (m) In the case of joint MALs, the personal liability for the amounts specified in this section are joint and several on the part of each producer signing the MAL note. Further, each producer who is a party to a joint MAL will be jointly and severally liable for any violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement, and the regulations in this part. Each such producer also remains liable for repayment of the entire MAL amount until the MAL is fully repaid without regard to such producer's claimed share in the honey, or MAL proceeds, after execution of the note and security agreement by CCC.

      (n) Any or all of the liquidated damages assessed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived as determined by CCC.

      (o) Remedies set out in this section are in addition to remedies the CCC will have through its security interest on honey that secures the repayment of the loan made on the honey.

      (p) All remedies provided for in this section or part are in addition to any remedies as may otherwise be provided for in law.

Direct-consumption sugar derived from sugar beets and testing 92 or more sugar degrees by the polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value by multiplying the actual number of pounds of such sugar by 1.07. Sugar derived from sugarcane and testing 92 sugar degrees or more by the polariscope shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner: raw value = {[(actual degree of polarization − 92) × 0.0175] + 0.93} × actual weight. For sugar testing less than 92 sugar degrees by the polariscope, derive raw value by dividing the number of pounds of the “total sugar content” ( the sum of the sucrose and invert sugars) thereof by 0.972.

        means desirable inventories of sugar owned by sugar beet processors, sugarcane processors, cane sugar refiners, and CCC and on hand in the United States at the end of the fiscal year, as CCC determines.

        (3) Provide quantity and quality information as prescribed by CCC of the commodity to be pledged as collateral;

        (4) Pay CCC a loan service fee, as determined by CCC, for the disbursement of each loan.

        (5) If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar or in-process sugar pledged as loan collateral, obtain waivers that fully protect CCC's interest even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances shall be placed on the sugar after loan approval; and

        (6) Agree to reimburse CCC for any costs incurred as a result of the failure of the processor to obtain the waivers specified in subparagraph (5).

        (b) No loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar and in-process sugar have actually been produced and are otherwise established as being eligible to be pledged as loan collateral.

        (c)(1) A processor may, within the loan availability period, repledge as collateral sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid loan. In making application for such a loan, the processor shall:

        (i) Specify that the loan collateral should be treated as a quantity of eligible sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid loan; and

        (ii) Designate the loan to which the reoffered loan collateral was originally pledged.

        (2) The subsequent loan shall have the same maturity date as the original loan.

        (3) Loan collateral repledged that was previously redeemed from CCC is not included in determining the total quantity of sugar on which loans have been obtained for purposes of § 1435.102.

        (d) Raw cane sugar loan disbursements shall be made without regard to the actual polarity or quality factors of the sugar pledged as loan collateral but shall be made on the assumption that the polarity of such sugar is 96 degrees by the polariscope.

        (e)(1) Loans will mature at the earlier of:

        (i) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the 1st day of the first month after the month in which the loan is made; or

        (b) The security interests CCC obtains as a result of the execution of security agreements by sugarcane and sugar beet processors shall be superior to all statutory and common law liens on raw cane sugar, refined beet sugar, and in-process sugar for the producers of sugarcane and sugar beets and all prior recorded and unrecorded liens on the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived.

        (c) A processor receiving a loan under this part shall pay all eligible producers who have delivered or will deliver sugar beets or sugarcane to such processors for processing not less than the minimum payment levels CCC specifies for the applicable crop year.

        (1) In the case of sugar beets, the minimum payment shall not exceed the rate of payment provided for under the applicable contract between a sugar beet producer and a sugar beet processor.

        (2) In the case of sugarcane, CCC will annually determine and announce the annual grower minimum payment.

        (3) Processors are ineligible for loans for the crop year following their failure to meet the required minimum grower payment.

        (d)(1) A processor shall maintain eligible sugar or in-process sugar of sufficient quality and quantity as collateral to satisfy the processor's loan indebtedness to CCC. CCC shall not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the loan collateral.

        (2) The processor is responsible for storage costs through the loan maturity date or title transfer to CCC, whichever occurs later.

        (3) Sugar and in-process sugar pledged as loan collateral need not be stored identity preserved.

        (4) When the proceeds of the sale of loan collateral are needed to repay all or part of a sugar loan, the processor may request and obtain prior written approval from the loan making office by executing a loan collateral release request, as prescribed by CCC, to remove a specified quantity of the loan collateral from storage for the purpose of delivering it to a buyer before loan repayment. Any such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form. The loan making office shall not approve such a request unless the buyer of the sugar agrees to pay CCC an amount necessary to satisfy the processor's loan indebtedness regarding collateral being sold. Any such approval shall not:

        (i) Constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the loan collateral; or

        (ii) Relieve the processor of liability for the full amount of the loan indebtedness, including interest.

        (b) Forfeiture of sugar loan collateral will be accepted as payment in full of the principal and interest due under a nonrecourse loan, subject to applicable premiums and discounts based on the difference between specifications reported on the sugar loan certification report and actual loadout characteristics.

        (c)(1) Forfeiture of in-process sugar serving as loan collateral will be accepted as payment in full of principal and interest if the processor converts the in-process sugar into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar of acceptable grade and quality for sugar eligible for loans within 1 month of loan maturity.

        (2) The in-process sugar must be fully processed into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, before the processor shall transfer the sugar to CCC.

        (3) On transfer of the sugar, CCC shall make a payment to the processor in an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the difference between the loan rate for raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as appropriate, and the in-process loan rate the processor received by the quantity of sugar transferred to CCC. The loan agreement shall specify the quantity of sugar that can be forfeited to CCC.

        (d) If the processor does not forfeit the collateral, but instead further processes the in-process sugar into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar and repays the loan on the in-process sugar;

        (1) the processor may obtain a loan for the raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as appropriate, and

        (2) the term of a loan made under this subsection for a quantity of in-process sugar, when combined with the term of a loan made for the raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar derived from the in-process sugar, may not exceed 9 months.

        (e) CCC shall not accept delivery of sugar in settlement of a nonrecourse loan in excess of the quantity of sugar that is shown on the note and security agreement minus any quantity that was redeemed or released for removal under this section.

        (f) If the processor does not redeem any of the nonrecourse loan collateral, title to the unredeemed nonrecourse loan collateral as described in the note and security agreement will, without further CCC or processor action transfer to CCC in-store at the CCC-approved warehouse at 12 a.m. the next business day following the maturity date of the loan. Title, all rights, and interest to such sugar shall immediately vest in CCC.

        (g) The value of the settlement of loans shall be made by CCC according to the CCC schedule of premiums and discounts.

        (h) CCC may, at any time, accelerate the date for loan repayment including interest. CCC will give the processor notice of such acceleration at least 15 days in advance of the accelerated loan maturity date.

        (i) If a processor's nonrecourse loan indebtedness is not satisfied under the provisions of this section or if forfeited in-process sugar is not converted to raw or refined sugar within the prescribed time:

        (1) Interest on the processor's indebtedness shall accrue as specified in part 1403 of this title and shall accrue until the debt is paid;

        (2) CCC may, upon notice, with or without removing the collateral from storage, sell such collateral at either a public or private sale;

        (3) The processor shall be liable for the deficiency if the net proceeds are less than the amount of principal, interest, and any other charges CCC incurs; and

        (4) If the processor forfeits the in-process sugar loan collateral but does not transfer raw or refined sugar of suitable quality to CCC within 1 month, CCC will charge liquidated damages, as provided in the loan agreement.

        (j) The CCC rates for the storage of forfeited sugar to approved warehouses for each crop year of 2008 through 2011 will be at least:

        (1) For refined sugar, 15 cents per hundredweight of refined sugar per month; and

        (2) For raw cane sugar, 10 cents per hundredweight of raw cane sugar per month.

        (3) For 2012 and subsequent crop years, rates for the storage of forfeited sugar will revert to those used before June 18, 2008.

        (4) For sugar located in space not approved by CCC for storage, the payment rate will be zero until such time as the processor delivers such sugar to a CCC-approved warehouse.

        § 1435.302   Establishment of allotments.

#### § § 1435.302

        (a) By the beginning of the crop year, CCC will establish the overall allotment quantity, beet sugar and cane sugar allotments, State cane sugar allotments, and allocations for processors marketing sugar domestically processed from sugarcane, sugar beets, or in-process beet sugar, whether the sugar beets or in-process beet sugar is domestically produced or imported at a level:

        (1) That is sufficient to maintain raw and refined sugar prices above minimum prices to avoid forfeiture of loans to the CCC, but

        (2) Not less that 85 percent of estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop year.

        (b) Determinations under this section to establish marketing allotments will be published in the  and accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the determination.

        § 1435.303   Adjustment of the overall allotment quantity.

#### § § 1435.303

        (a) The overall allotment quantity may be adjusted, as CCC determines appropriate, but never to a quantity less than 85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop year:

        (1) To avoid forfeiture of sugar loan collateral to CCC,

        (2) Ensure adequate supplies of raw and refined sugar in the domestic market, and,

        (3) To reflect changes in estimated sugar consumption, stocks, production, or imports based on re-estimates under § 1435.301.

        (b) Determinations to adjust the overall allotment quantity will be published in the  and accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the determination.

        (c) The beet sugar allotment, cane sugar allotment, State cane sugar allotments, proportionate shares, and allocations to each sugar beet processor and sugarcane processor will be increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect an overall allotment quantity adjustment.

        (d) If the overall allotment quantity is reduced under paragraph (a) of this section and the quantity of sugar and sugar products any individual processor marketed by the time of the reduction exceeds the processor's reduced allocation, the quantity of excess sugar or sugar products marketed will be deducted from the processor's allocation under an allotment next established.

        § 1435.305   State cane sugar allotments.

#### § § 1435.305

        (a) Hawaii and Puerto Rico will be allotted a total of 325,000 short tons, raw value, of the cane sugar allotment.

        (b) A new entrant cane State will receive an allotment to accommodate a new processor's allocation under 1435.308.

        (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the remaining cane States will be allotted, in aggregate, the remaining cane sugar allotment.

        (d) The individual cane State allotments, other than a new entrant cane State, will be based on:

        (1) Past marketings of cane sugar,

        (2) Past processing of cane sugar, and

        (3) The ability to market the sugar covered under the allotment assigned to the State.

        (e) Past marketings and past processings will each be weighted by 0.25 and the ability to market will be weighted by 0.50 in determining the States' respective cane sugar allotments. The weights may be adjusted, as CCC deems appropriate, for the crop year.

        (f) Except when deficits are reassigned as provided in § 1435.309, a processor may fill an allocation of a cane sugar allotment only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State for which the allotment was established.

        § 1435.306   Allocation of marketing allotments to processors.

#### § § 1435.306

        (a) Each sugar beet processor's allocation, other than a new entrant's, of the beet allotment will be calculated as the beet processor's share times the beet sector allotment:

        (1) A beet processor's share is calculated as the beet processor's adjusted weighted average sugar production divided by the sum of all beet processors' adjusted weighted average sugar production.

        (2) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production equals 0.25 times its 1998-crop sugar production plus 0.35 times its 1999-crop sugar production plus 0.40 times its 2000-crop sugar production, with the 2000 sugar PIK payments added to its 2000-crop sugar production.

        (3) A beet processor's weighted average sugar production shall be adjusted by the following, as CCC determines:

        (i) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' weighted average sugar production for opening a sugar beet processing factory during the 1996 through 2000 crop years;

        (ii) Decreased 1.25 percent of the sum of beet processors' weighted average sugar production for closing a sugar beet processing factory during the 1998 through 2000 crop years:

        (iii) Increased 0.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' weighted average sugar production for opening a molasses desugarization facility during the 1998 through 2000 crop years; and

        (iv) Increased 1.25 percent of the sum of all beet processors' weighted average sugar production for suffering a substantial quality loss on stored beets, as CCC determines, during the 1998 through 2000 crop years.

        (b) Each sugarcane processor's, other than a new entrant's, allocation from a State cane sugar allotment will be calculated as the cane processor's share times the State cane sector allotment.

        (1) Each cane processor's share will be calculated as the processor's production base divided by the sum of the State's processor production bases.

        (2) A processor's production base is the sum of 0.50 times its ability to market plus 0.25 times its past processings plus 0.25 times its past marketings. These weights may be adjusted as CCC deems appropriate for the crop year.

        (c) An informal hearing will be held in August of each year, if requested by affected sugarcane processors and growers by July 15th, to afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on the next crop year's marketing allotments and allocations. After consideration of comments obtained at the hearing, a final determination on cane State allotments and processor allocations will be announced.

        (d) During any crop year in which marketing allotments are in effect and allocated to processors, the quantity of sugar and sugar products that a processor markets shall not exceed the quantity of the processor's allocation.

        (e) Paragraph (d) of this section will not apply to:

        (1) Any sugar marketings to facilitate the export of sugar or sugar-containing products as long as such exports are not eligible to receive credits under reexport programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service for refined sugar or sugar-containing products;

        (2) Any sugar marketings for nonhuman consumption, except for the sale of sugar for the production of ethanol or other bioenergy under the Feedstock Flexibility program or the sale of sugar for the production of polyhydric alcohol under the Polyhydric Alcohol program administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service; and

        (3) Any processor marketings of sugar to another processor made to enable the purchasing processor to fulfill its allocation if such sales;

        (i) Are made before May 1, and

        (ii) Reported to CCC within 51 days of the date of sale.

        (f) Paragraph (d) of this section also shall not apply to marketings of purchased sugar marketed in the crop year of the purchase, but does apply to marketings of sugar purchased as part of a transaction pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (g) Paragraph (d) of this section also will not apply to the marketing of beet sugar processed from purchased in-process beet sugar if the processor purchased the in-process beet sugar before October 1, 2008.

        (h) A sugar beet processor allocated a share of the beet sugar allotment may use only beet sugar to fill such allocation. A sugarcane processor allocated a share of the cane sugar allotment may only use cane sugar to fill such allocation.

        § 1435.307   Transfer of allocation.

#### § § 1435.307

        (a) If a sugarcane processing facility is sold or transferred to another owner or is closed as part of a corporate consolidation CCC will transfer the allotment allocation to the purchaser or successor.

        (b) In proportionate share States, allocations, based on the number of acres of sugarcane base being transferred and the pro rata amount reflecting the grower's contribution to allocation of the processor for the sugarcane base being transferred, will be transferred between facilities if the transfers are based on:

        (1) Written consent of the crop-share owners, or their representatives,

        (2) Written certification from the processor that will accept the additional sugarcane deliveries that its processing capacity will not be exceeded,

        (3) CCC will only consider requests for transfer of allocation submitted during the month of May. The request must include the grower's sugar production history for crop years 1997 through 2003. The facility with the grower's history will be required to certify the history when requested by the grower, and

        (4) Allocation transfers will be effective for the next fiscal year after the request is submitted to CCC, that is beginning October 1.

        (c) If a sugar beet processing facility or a sugarcane processing facility located in a non-proportionate share State is closed, and the growers that delivered their crops to the closed facility elect to deliver their crops to another processor, the growers may petition the Executive Vice President, CCC, to transfer their share of the allocation from the processor that closed the facility to their new processor. If CCC approves transfer of the allocations, it will distribute the closed facility's allocation based on the contribution of the growers' production history to the closed facility's allocation. CCC may grant the allocation transfer upon:

        (1) Written request by a grower to transfer allocation,

        (2) Written approval of the processor that will accept the additional deliveries,

        (3) Evidence satisfactory to CCC that the new processor has the capacity to accommodate the production of petitioning growers, and

        (4) Determinations by the CCC will be made within 60 days after the filing of the petition.

        (d) Subject to a transfer of allocation, if any, described in paragraph (c) of this section being completed, CCC will consider a processor to be permanently terminated and eliminate the processor's remaining allocation and distribute it to all other processors on a pro-rata basis when the processor:

        (1) Has been dissolved,

        (2) Has been liquidated in a bankruptcy proceeding,

        (3) Has not processed sugarcane or sugar beets for 2 consecutive crop years,

        (4) Has notified CCC that the processor has permanently terminated operations, or

        (5) Has been determined by CCC to have permanently terminated operations.

        (e) If a processor of beet sugar purchases all the assets of another processor, then CCC will immediately transfer allocation commensurate with the purchased facilities' production history, unless the allocation has already been transferred under paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f) If a processor of beet sugar purchases some, but not all, of the assets of another processor, then CCC will assign a pro rata portion of the allocation to the buyer to reflect the historical contribution of the sold facilities, unless the buyer and seller have agreed upon a different allocation amount.

        (1) The assignment of the allocation will apply to the crop year in which the sale occurs and for each subsequent year.

        (2) The buyer of the facilities as specified in paragraph (e) of this section may fill the assigned allocation with production from other facilities it owns if the purchased facilities lack the production to fill the assigned allocation.

        § 1435.308   New entrants.

#### § § 1435.308

        (a) The Secretary may assign a new entrant sugarcane processor an allocation that provides a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of allocations:

        (1) Applicants must demonstrate their ability to process, produce, and market sugar for the applicable crop year,

        (2) CCC will consider any adverse effects of the allocation upon existing processors and producers,

        (3) CCC will conduct a hearing on a new entrant application if an interested processor or grower requests a hearing,

        (4) A new entrant's allocation is limited to no more than 50,000 short tons, raw value, for the first crop year, and

        (5) A new entrant will be provided, as determined by CCC:

        (i) A share of its State's cane allotment if the processor is located in Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, or Texas or

        (ii) A share of the overall mainland cane allotment if the processor is located in any mainland State not listed in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.

        (b) For proportionate share States, CCC will establish proportionate shares for the sugarcane required to fill the allocation.

        (c) If a new entrant beet processor constructs a new facility or reopens a facility that currently has no allocation, but last produced beet sugar from sugar beets and sugar beet molasses prior to the 1998 crop year, CCC will:

        (1) Assign an allocation to the new entrant to enable it to achieve a facility utilization rate comparable to other similarly-situated sugar beet processors and

        (2) Reduce all other beet processor allocations by a like amount on a pro rata basis.

        (d) If a new entrant acquires an existing facility with production history that processed sugar beets for the 1998 or subsequent crop year, CCC will:

        (1) Assign the allocation to the buyer to reflect the historical contribution of the sold facilities, unless the buyer and seller have agreed upon a different allocation amount, or

        (2) If the new entrant and the processor holding the allocation of the existing facility cannot agree on an allocation amount, the new entrant will be denied a beet sugar allocation.

        § 1435.309   Reassignment of deficits.

#### § § 1435.309

        (a) CCC will determine, from time to time, whether sugar beet or sugarcane processors will be unable to market their allocations.

        (b) Sugar beet and sugar cane processors will report to CCC current inventories, estimated production, expected marketings, and any other pertinent factors CCC deems appropriate to determine a processor's ability to market their allocation.

        (c) If CCC determines a sugarcane processor will be unable to market its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in effect, the deficit will be reassigned as follows:

        (1) First, to allocations of other sugarcane processors within that State based on each processor's initial allocation share of the State's allotment, but no processor may receive reassigned allocation such that its allocation exceeds its estimated total sugar supply.

        (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated after reassignment within the same State, be reassigned to the other cane States based on each State's initial share of the cane sugar allotment, but no State may receive reassigned State allotment such that its allocation exceeds its estimated total sugar supply, with the reassigned quantity to each State being allocated according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (3) If the deficit cannot be eliminated by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, be reassigned to CCC. CCC shall sell such quantity from inventory unless CCC determines such sales would have a significant effect on the sugar price.

        (4) If any portion of the deficit remains after paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section have been implemented, be reassigned to imports of raw cane sugar.

        (d) The initial estimate of the sugarcane deficit will be reassigned by June 1. CCC will conduct later reassignments if CCC determines, after June 1, that a sugarcane processor will be unable to market its full allocation.

        (e) If CCC determines that a sugar beet processor is unable to market its full allocation for the crop year in which an allotment is in effect, the deficit will:

        (1) First, be reassigned proportionately to allocations of other sugar beet processors, depending on the capacity of other processors to fill the portion of the deficit to be reassigned to them, accounting for the interests of associated producers.

        (2) If the deficit cannot be eliminated by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, be reassigned to CCC. CCC shall sell such quantity from inventory unless CCC determines such sales would have a significant effect on the sugar price.

        (3) If any portion of the deficit remains after paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section have been implemented, be reassigned to imports of raw cane sugar.

        (f) The crop year allocation of each sugar beet or sugarcane processor who receives a reassignment will be increased accordingly for that year.

        § 1435.310   Sharing processors' allocations with producers.

#### § § 1435.310

        (a) Every sugar beet and sugarcane processor must provide CCC a certification that:

        (1) The processor intends to share its allocation among its producers fairly and equitably, and in a manner adequately reflecting each producer's production history, and

        (2) The processor has, in the previous allotment year, shared its allocation among producers fairly and equitably, reflecting each producer's production history. If a processor is unable to provide such certification, CCC may reduce or eliminate its marketing allocation.

        (b) CCC will determine that a processor in a proportionate share state has met the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section if the processor establishes a grower payment plan that incorporates the following provisions:

        (1) Pays growers for sugar from their delivered sugarcane in the following priority:

        (i) Sugar production from proportionate share acreage; as established under § 1435.311, for producers determined by CCC, who;

        (A) Delivered to the mill in at least one of the crop years 1999, 2000, or 2001, or

        (B) Obtained an allocation transfer from a predecessor mill,

        (ii) Sugar production from base acreage, as established under § 1435.312, but exclusive of the acreage described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, for producers who meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, then

        (iii) All other sugar production.

        (2) In determining the payment priority, a processor may aggregate the acreage of an operator (producer making the crop production decisions) across all the operator's farms delivering cane to the processor.

        (c) CCC will determine that a processor not in a proportionate share state, which is cooperatively owned by producers, has met the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section if the processor shares its allocation with its producers according to its cooperative membership agreement.

        (d) CCC will disclose farm base and reported acres data in a proportionate share state to processors upon their request for growers delivering to their mill. In the case of multiple producers on a farm or growers delivering to more than one mill, subject mills will be responsible for coordinating proportionate share data.

        (e) Any producer or processor may request arbitration of a dispute regarding the sharing of the processor's allocation among the producers. Arbitration will be available on behalf of CCC at the State FSA office for the State in which the processor is located. Subsequent review of the arbitration decision is available at the discretion of the Executive Vice President, CCC. Any arbitration is subject to appeal to the Office of the Administrative Law Judge, USDA.

        § 1435.311   Proportionate shares for sugarcane producers.

#### § § 1435.311

        (a) Proportionate shares and the provisions of this section and §§ 1435.312 through 1435.316 apply only to Louisiana sugarcane farms.

        (b) CCC will determine whether Louisiana sugar production, in the absence of proportionate shares, will exceed the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory. If the determination is made that the quantity of sugar produced in Louisiana, plus a normal carryover inventory, will exceed the State's allotment, CCC will establish for each sugarcane producing farm a proportionate share that limits the sugarcane acreage that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed.

        (c) For purposes of determining proportionate shares CCC will:

        (1) Establish the State's per-acre yield goal at a level not less than the average per-acre yield in the State for the 2 highest years from among the 1999 through 2001 crop years;

        (2) Adjust the per-acre yield goal by the State average recovery rate;

        (3) Convert the State cane sugar allotment into a State acreage allotment by dividing the State allotment by the adjusted per-acre yield goal;

        (4) Establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allotment by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State as determined under § 1435.312; and

        (5) Apply the uniform reduction percentage to the acreage base established for each sugarcane producing farm in the State to determine the farm's proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar or seed.

        § 1435.312   Establishment of acreage bases under proportionate shares.

#### § § 1435.312

        (a) CCC will establish a sugarcane crop acreage base for each farm subject to proportionate shares as the simple average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed (meaning only those varieties dedicated to the production of sugarcane to produce sugar for human consumption) on the farm in the 2 highest of the 1999 through 2001 crop years. Acreage considered planted shall be determined under § 1435.315.

        (b) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will:

        (1) Not consider acreage prevented from planting, and

        (2) Consider acreage planted to sugarcane that fails.

        (c) In establishing crop acreage bases, CCC will allow producers who have not previously reported their sugarcane acreage to do so by a date CCC determines and announces. Late-filed acreage reports will be accepted as the Deputy Administrator determines appropriate.

        (d) The farm's crop acreage base shall be used to determine the farm's proportionate share.

        (e) The regulations at part 718 of this title shall apply to this subpart, except reconstitution of farms with a sugar crop acreage base shall not be allowed across State lines.

        § 1435.313   Permanent transfer of acreage base histories under proportionate shares.

#### § § 1435.313

        (a) A sugarcane producer on a farm may transfer all or a portion of the producer's acreage base history of land owned, operated, or controlled to any other farm in the State that the producer owns, operates, or controls under the Deputy Administrator-issued instructions. The transfer will reduce permanently the transferring farm's sugarcane acreage base history and increase the receiving farm's crop acreage base.

        (1) All farm owners must agree in writing to the transfer.

        (2) Producers may transfer sugarcane acreage base histories under this section by the date the State FSA committee establishes annually.

        (b) Sugarcane acreage base that has been converted to nonagricultural use on or before May 13, 2002, may be transferred to other land suitable for the production of sugarcane under the following terms:

        (1) CCC must notify 1 or more affected landowners within 90 days of becoming aware of the conversion, of their rights to transfer the base to 1 or more farms owned by the landowner;

        § 1435.314   Temporary transfer of proportionate share due to disasters.

#### § § 1435.314

        (a) If, for reasons beyond the control of a producer on a farm, such producer is unable to harvest sugarcane acreage relative to all or a portion of the proportionate share established for the farm, the Secretary may preserve, on producer application and written consent of all owners of the farm, for a period of not more than 5 consecutive years, the acreage base history of the farm to the extent of the proportionate share involved.

        (b) Such proportionate share may be transferred, with the written consent of all owners of the farm, for 1 crop year to other farm owners or operators subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The acreage base history of the transferring farm will be preserved for a period from 1 to 5 years; and

        (2) Acreage base history will not be increased on the receiving farm.

        (c) Producers who transfer a proportionate share under this section will be required to:

        (1) Initiate the transfer in the county FSA office where the proportionate shares are established; and

        (2) Obtain approval from the transferring county FSA committee.

        (d) All transfers made under this section must be completed by the date the State FSA committee establishes.

        § 1435.315   Adjustments to proportionate shares.

#### § § 1435.315

        Whenever CCC determines that, because of a natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of producers adversely affecting a sugarcane crop, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject to proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable state processors to produce sufficient sugar to meet the State's cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover of sugar, CCC may uniformly allow producers to harvest sugarcane in excess of their proportionate shares, or suspend proportionate shares entirely.

        § 1435.316   Acreage reports for purposes of proportionate shares.

#### § § 1435.316

        (a) A report of planted and failed acreage shall be required on farms that produce sugarcane for sugar or seed. Such report shall also specify the total acreage intended for harvest for sugar and seed.

        (b) The reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be on forms prescribed by CCC and shall be filed annually with the county FSA committee by the applicable final reporting date CCC establishes. The farm operator or farm owner shall file such reports.

        (c) Acreage reports will be used to determine compliance with proportionate shares and acreage bases for future proportionate shares.

        (d) An acreage report may be accepted after the established date for reporting if physical evidence is still available for inspection that may be used to make a determination relative to:

        (1) Existence of the crop;

        (2) Use made of the crop;

        (3) Lack of crop; or

        (4) Disaster condition affecting the crop.

        (e) The farm operator shall pay the cost of a farm visit by an authorized FSA employee unless the county FSA committee has determined that failure to report in a timely manner was beyond the producer's control.

        (f) The farm operator may revise an acreage report. Revised reports shall be filed in accordance with CCC instructions and shall be accepted at any time if:

        (1) Evidence exists for inspection and determination of:

        (i) Existence of the crop;

        (ii) Use made of the crop;

        (iii) Lack of crop; or

        (iv) Disaster condition affecting the crops.

        (2) The farm has not already been inspected and the acreage already determined or harvesting of sugarcane already begun.

        (g) Provisions of part 718 of this chapter will apply for field inspections, tolerance, and variance. Assessments for false acreage reporting will be applied under § 1435.318.

        § 1435.317   Revisions of allocations and proportionate shares.

#### § § 1435.317

        The Executive Vice President, CCC, may modify any processor's allocation or any producer's proportionate share on the same basis as the initial allocation or proportionate share was required to be established.

        § 1435.318   Penalties and assessments.

#### § § 1435.318

        (a) Any sugar beet or sugarcane processor who knowingly markets sugar or sugar products in excess of the processor's allocation will be liable to CCC for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the U.S. market value, at the time the violation was committed, of that quantity of sugar involved in the violation.

        (b) CCC may assess liquidated damages, as specified in a surplus allocation survey and agreement, with respect to a surplus allocation still existing after the end of a crop year if the processor had a surplus allocation because the processor provided incomplete or erroneous information to CCC.

        (c) Under § 359f(c)(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, any producer of sugarcane whose farm has a proportionate share, and who knowingly harvests or allows to be harvested an acreage of sugarcane for sugar or seed in excess of the farm's proportionate share shall pay to CCC a civil penalty in an amount equal to 1.5 times the U.S. market value of the quantity of sugar that is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the allocation of such processor, for the year in which the violation was committed. However, civil penalties will not be assessed when the producer harvests acreage for sugar or seed in excess of the farm's proportionate share, if the excess sugarcane harvested is:

        (1) Processed by a sugarcane processor that does not exceed its marketing allocation; or

        (2) Diverted to a use other than sugar or seed if:

        (i) The sugarcane producer requests and pays for a CCC field inspection, and

        (ii) CCC verifies the disposition of the excess harvest is not for sugar or seed.

        (d) Any penalty assessed under paragraph (b) of this section shall be prorated among the producers of all sugarcane acquired by the processor from excess acres.

        (e) Any person filing a false acreage report that exceeds tolerance will be subject to an assessment not to exceed the amount specified at § 3.91(b)(10)(iii) of this title. Whenever the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions applicable to proportionate shares would result in an assessment, the Deputy Administrator may authorize the waiver or reduction of the assessment in such amounts as determined to be equitable about the seriousness of the failure, the producer's good-faith effort to comply fully with such terms and conditions, and the producer's substantial performance.

        (f) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this subpart other than paragraph (d) of this section is subject to the assessment of a civil penalty by CCC of not more than the amount specified at § 3.91(b)(10)(iv) of this title for each violation.

        § 1435.501   Bid submission procedures.

#### § § 1435.501

        (a) After announcement by CCC that a program authorized by this subpart is in effect, processors who desire to participate in the program must submit a bid to CCC, on a form prescribed by CCC, that specifies:

        (1) For a program involving acreage diversion, the amount of acreage to be reduced by producers who have contracts for delivery of sugar beets or sugar cane to the processor and contains the information CCC determines necessary to conduct the program and includes but is not limited to:

        (i) The number of acres that the processor, acting in conjunction with the producers, will divert;

        (ii) The previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or sugarcane yield on that acreage while under contract (years with no production contracted with a producer will not be considered (for first-time producers, however, the previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or sugarcane yield for all the producers under contract who delivered to the applicable factory will be used);

        (iii) The previous 3-year simple average sugar content of the producer's beets or sugarcane (for first-time producers, the previous 3-year simple average sugar content for all beets or cane delivered to that factory will be used);

        (iv) The processor's previous 3-year simple average recovery rate (for processors that have not been fully operational during the last 3 years, the simple average for those years that they were fully operational);

        (v) The value of CCC sugar to be received as payment; and

        (vi) Other information CCC deems necessary for program administration; or

        (2) The sugar production capacity to be removed from production by the processor.

        (b) The following acreage is ineligible for enrollment in the PIK program:

        (1) If planted, acreage not currently under contract for delivery of sugar beets to a sugar beet processor or sugarcane to a sugarcane processor for sugar production.

        (2) If planted, acreage that is not harvestable,

        (3) Acreage devoted to roads or other non-producing areas, or

        (4) If planted, acreage on which a crop insurance indemnity or replant payment was received for the current crop or for which a claim has been, or will be, filed to receive a crop insurance indemnity or replant payment for the current crop, except for replant payments for acreage actually replanted before the end of the normal planting period.

        (c) If planted, the diverted acres cannot be grazed until after the sugar beets or sugarcane are destroyed by disking, plowing, or other means of mechanical destruction. In addition, the sugar beets or sugarcane on the diverted acres may not be used for any commercial purpose.

        (d) The acreage offered must meet the following requirements:

        (1) If less than or equal to 15 acres, then the acreage bid must consist of one of the following:

        (i) One contiguous area of land,

        (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or

        (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one contiguous area of land to complete the balance;

        (2) If more than 15 acres, then the acreage bid must consist of one of the following:

        (i) One or more areas of land of at least 15 contiguous acres each with one remaining area of land of less than 15 contiguous acres to complete the balance,

        (ii) One or more entire permanent fields, or

        (iii) One or more entire permanent fields and one area of contiguous land to complete the balance.

        (3) Contiguous areas of land must have a minimum width of 3 chains (198 feet).

        (e) For a program involving desugaring capacity, or other measures of sugar production, not involving acreage diversion, the bid must contain the information CCC determine necessary to conduct the program.

#### § § 1435.502

        (a) For bids in which the processor offers to remove acreage of sugar beets or sugarcane from production, CCC will rank bids on the basis of the bid amount as a percentage of the expected sugar produced from the retired acreage. Bids with the lowest of such percentages will be selected first. In the case of identical bids, selection may be based on random selection or pro rata shares, as CCC deems appropriate.

        (b) CCC will reject bids for which the bid amounts exceed the expected sugar produced from the retired acreage.

        (c) For bids in which the processor offers to remove sugar production capacity from production, CCC will rank the bids on the basis of the capacity to be removed from production.

        (d) All acceptable bids specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section will be further reviewed by CCC and ranked in order of the greatest reduction in sugar program that can be achieved at the lowest cost to CCC.

#### § § 1435.503

        (a) CCC will, through such methods as CCC deems appropriate, make payments in the form of sugar held in CCC inventory.

        (b) To the maximum extent practicable, CCC will use its inventory in making an in-kind payment based on the following priority:

        (1) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by the processor;

        (2) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor in the same region as the producer;

        (3) CCC-owned sugar held in storage by any other processor that is not in the same region as the producer; and

        (4) CCC-owned sugar held in storage anywhere in the United States, if CCC determines that such sugar is eligible to be used for in-kind payments.

        (c) The value of CCC-owned inventory is dependent upon the storage location of the sugar and the type of sugar (raw or refined). CCC will announce the value of its inventory before bid solicitation. Accordingly, the quantity of sugar CCC will provide in terms of an in-kind payment to a processor will be determined by dividing:

        (1) The total of the processor's bid amount that CCC accepts, by

        (2) The value of CCC's inventory at the storage location at which title will transfer from CCC to the processor.

        (b) Not later than January 1, April 1, and July 1 of the fiscal year, CCC will re-estimate the quantity of sugar that will be made available for purchase and sale under the FFP for the crop year.

        (c) CCC will announce by press release the estimates in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which will reflect CCC's forecast of sugar likely to be forfeited to CCC and any uncertainty surrounding that forecast.

        § 1435.602   Eligible sugar to be purchased by CCC.

#### § § 1435.602

        (a) CCC will only purchase raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar for FFP that is eligible to be used as collateral under the CCC Sugar Loan Program, as specified in § 1435.102.

        (b) Raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar purchased directly from any domestic sugar beet or sugarcane processor that made the raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar will be credited against the processor's sugar marketing allocation. (The definition for “marketing” in § 1435.2 applies to this subpart.)

        (c) CCC will only purchase sugar located in the United States.

        (d) CCC will evaluate an offer to sell sugar to CCC based upon CCC's estimate of the reduction in refined sugar supply available for human consumption due to the purchase. For example, if processing thick juice (an in-process sugar) would yield 70 percent sugar for human consumption, then CCC will only consider 70 percent of the volume of the thick juice in evaluating the per unit sales price.

        (e) CCC will only purchase the sugar if such purchase would reduce the likelihood of forfeitures of CCC sugar loans, as determined by CCC.

      § 1436.7   Loan term.

#### § § 1436.7

      (a) For eligible facility loan commodities other than sugar, the term of the loan will not exceed 12 years, based on the total loan principal and loan request type, from the date a promissory note and security agreement is completed on both the partial and final loan disbursement. As determined by the Deputy Administrator, used equipment FSFLs may have a loan term of 3 or 5 years. The applicant will choose a loan term, based on the loan request type at the time of submitting the loan application and total cost estimates. Available loan terms are 3, 5, 7, 10, or 12 years; available terms for a specific loan will be based on the loan principal and facility or equipment type.

      (b) The Deputy Administrator has the discretion and authority to extend loan terms for 1 or 2 years, on a case by case basis. Loan term extensions will only be granted after a written request is received from the producer before loan term expires and when determined appropriate by Deputy Administrator to assist borrowers with additional loan servicing options. Producers and participants who have already agreed to the loan term (maturity date) have no right to an extension of the loan term. The borrower agrees to the loan term through the Promissory Note at the time of distribution. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to exercise discretion to consider an extension will not be considered an adverse decision or a failure to act under any law or regulation and, therefore, is not appealable. Participants are not entitled to extensions or the consideration of a request for extension.

      (c) For a sugar-related loan:

      (1) CCC, at its discretion, may authorize a maximum loan term of 15 years. The minimum loan term of a sugar-related loan is 7 years.

      (2) The loan balance and costs are due at the end of the loan term, which will be established on the date the promissory note and security agreement is executed.

      § 1436.8   Security for loan.

#### § § 1436.8

      (a) Except as agreed to by CCC, all loans must be secured by a promissory note and security agreement covering the facility and such other assurances as CCC may demand, subject to the following:

      (1) The promissory note and security agreement must grant CCC a security interest in the collateral and must be perfected in the manner specified in the laws of the State where the collateral is located.

      (2) CCC's security interest in the collateral must be the sole security interest in such collateral except for prior liens on the underlying real estate that by operation of law attach to the collateral if it is or will become a fixture. If any such prior lien on the real estate will attach to the collateral, a severance agreement must be obtained in writing from each holder of such a lien, including all government or USDA agencies. No additional liens or encumbrances may be placed on the facility after the loan is approved unless CCC approves otherwise in writing.

      (3) CCC will hold title in accordance to applicable State laws and motor vehicle administration title provisions, to all eligible equipment, structures, components and storage and handling trucks acquired using loan proceeds under this part.

      (b) For loan amounts equal to or less than $100,000, or when the aggregate outstanding FSFLs balance will be equal to or less than $100,000, CCC will not require a severance agreement from the holder of any prior lien on the real estate parcel on which the facility is located. However, the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, or a State Committee may, at their discretion, require a severance agreement for loan amounts greater than $50,000 or less than $100,000 for all FSFLs in the State, if deemed necessary to protect the interests of CCC. If no severance agreement is provided, then the borrower must:

      (1) Agree to increase the down payment on the facility loan from 15 percent to 20 percent, except for an FSFL microloan; or

      (2) Provides other security such as an irrevocable letter of credit or other form of security approved by CCC.

      (c) For loan amounts equal to or less than $100,000, or when the aggregate outstanding FSFLs balance will be equal to or less than $100,000, CCC will not require a lien on the real estate parcel on which the facility is located. However, the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs or a State Committee may, at their discretion, require a lien in the form of a real estate mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument approved by USDA's Office of the General Counsel for loans greater than $50,000 or less than $100,000 for all FSFLs in the State, if deemed necessary to protect the interests of CCC. Liens are required for all loans greater than $100,000. All liens must meet the following conditions:

      (1) CCC's interest in the real estate must be superior to all other liens, except a loan may be secured by a junior lien on real estate when the loan is adequately secured and a severance agreement is obtained from prior lien holders; and

      (2) The real estate security for the loan must be at least equal to the loan amount; and

      (3) If the real estate is covered by a prior lien, a lien waiver may be obtained by means of a subordination agreement approved for use in the State by USDA's Office of the General Counsel. CCC will not require such an agreement from any agency of USDA.

      (d) Title insurance or a title opinion is required for loans secured by real estate.

      (e) Real estate liens, with prior CCC approval, may cover land separate from the collateral if a lien on the underlying real estate is not feasible and if:

      (1) The borrower owns the separate acreage and the acreage is not subject to any other liens or mortgages that are superior to CCC's lien interest and

      (2) The acreage is of adequate size and value at the time of the application as determined by the county committee to adequately secure and insure repayment of the loan.

      (f) A borrower, in lieu of such liens required by this section, may provide an irrevocable letter of credit, bond, or other form of security, as approved by CCC.

      (g) If an existing structure is remodeled and an addition becomes an attached, integral part of the existing storage structure, CCC's security interest will include the remodeled addition as well as the existing storage structure.

      (h) For all farm storage facility loans, except sugar loans, the borrower must pay the cost of loan closings by attorneys, title opinions, title insurance, title searches, filing, and recording all real estate liens, fixture filings, appraisals if requested by the borrower, and all subordinations. CCC will pay costs relating to credit reports, collateral lien searches, and filing and recording financing statements for the collateral.

      (i) For loan amounts equal to or less than $100,000, or when the aggregate outstanding FSFLs balance will be equal to or less than $100,000, and secured by collateral without any resale value, as determined by CCC, additional security will not be required. However, the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs or a State Committee may, at their discretion, for all FSFLs in the State, require additional security for loan amounts greater than $50,000 or less than $100,000 that are secured by collateral without any resale value if deemed necessary to protect the interests of the CCC.

      (j) For sugar storage facility loans, in addition to other requirements in this section, additional security, including real estate, chattels, crops in storage, and other assets owned by the applicant, is required if deemed necessary by CCC to adequately secure the loan. A sugar storage facility loan will generally be considered to be adequately secured when the CCC-determined value of security for the loan is equal to at least 125 percent of the loan amount.

      (k) For sugar storage facility loans, paragraph (h) of this section is not applicable. However, the borrower must pay all loan making fees and closing costs. This includes, but is not limited to, attorney fees for loan closings, environmental assessments and studies, chattel and real estate appraisals, title opinions, title insurance, title searches, and filing and recording all real estate liens, fixture filings, subordinations, credit reports, collateral lien searches, and filing and recording financing statements for the collateral.

      § 1436.9   Loan amount and loan application approvals.

#### § § 1436.9

      (a) The cost on which the loan will be based is the net cost of the eligible facility, accessories, and services to the applicant after discounts and rebates, not to exceed a maximum per-bushel, -ton or, -cubic foot cost established by the FSA State committee.

      (b) The net cost for all facilities:

      (1) May include the following: All real estate lien related fees paid by the borrower, including attorney fees, except for filing fees; environmental and historic review fees including archaeological study fees; the facility purchase price; sales tax; shipping; delivery charges; site preparation costs; installation cost; material and labor for concrete pads and foundations; material and labor for electrical wiring; electrical motors; off-farm paid labor; on-farm site preparation and construction equipment costs not to exceed commercial rates approved by the county committee; and recently required on-farm material approved by the county committee.

      (2) May not include secondhand material or any other item determined by the approving authority to be ineligible for loan.

      (c) The maximum total principal amount of the FSFL, except for FSFL microloans, is 85 percent of the net cost of the applicant's needed facility, not to exceed $500,000 per loan. For FSFL microloans the maximum total principal amount of the farm storage facility loan is 95 percent of the net costs of the applicant's needed storage, handling facility, including drying and handling equipment, or storage and handling trucks, not to exceed an aggregate outstanding balance of $50,000.

      (d) The storage need requirement for eligible facility loan commodities will be determined as follows:

      (1) For facility loan commodities, except sugar, cold storage commodities, maple sap, and milk:

      (i) Multiply the average of the applicant's share of the acres farmed for the most recent three years for each type of facility loan commodity requiring suitable storage at the proposed facility;

      (ii) By a yield determined reasonable by the county committee;

      (iii) Multiply by two (for 2 years production); and

      (iv) Subtract existing storage capacity in the units of measurement, such as bushels, tons, or cubic feet, for the type of storage needed to determine remaining storage need.

      (v) Compare capacity of proposed facility with storage need (calculated as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section) to determine if applicant is eligible for additional storage.

      (2) For sugar storage facility loans,

      (i) Identify past processing volume and marketing allotments;

      (ii) Use the processor's projection of processing volume, available storage capacity, volume not to be marketed due to marketing allotment, and other appropriate factors affecting the processor's storage need to estimate the storage need requirement, and

      (iii) Compare capacity of proposed facility with storage need (estimated as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(ii) of this section) to determine if additional storage is required.

      (3) For cold storage facilities:

      (i) Multiply the average of the applicant's share of production or of acres farmed for the most recent 3 years for each eligible commodity requiring cold storage at the proposed facility;

      (ii) By a yield determined reasonable by the county committee;

      (iii) Determine cold storage needed (calculated as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)-(ii) of this section) with the assistance of NIFA, land-grant university, or ARS publications; and

      (iv) Subtract existing cold storage capacity to determine remaining storage need.

      (v) Compare capacity of proposed cold storage facility with cold storage need (calculated as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)-(iv) of this section) to determine if applicant is eligible for additional cold storage.

      (4) For all eligible facility loan commodities, except sugar, if acreage data is not practicable or available for State and County Committees or authorized FSA staff to determine the storage need, specifically, but not limited to, maple sap, eggs, butter, cheese, yogurt, milk, meat and poultry, a reasonable production yield, such as ERS or NASS data may be used to determine the storage capacity need. A reasonable production yield may also be used for newly acquired farms, specialty farming, changes in cropping operations, prevented planted acres, or for facility loan commodities being grown for the first time.

      (5) For FSFL microloans if the FSA State and county committees determine that self-certification is practicable based on the applicant's farm operation, then CCC may allow applicants to self-certify to the storage capacity need. The Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, or an FSA State committee may rescind the FSFL microloan provision on a Statewide basis if it is determined that allowing FSFL microloans has increased the likelihood of loan defaults and is not in the best interest of CCC.

      (e) When a storage structure has a larger capacity than the applicant's needed capacity, as determined by CCC, the net cost eligible for a loan will be prorated. Only costs associated with the applicant's needed storage capacity will be considered eligible for loan under this part.

      (f) Any borrower with an outstanding loan must use the financed structure only for the storage of eligible facility loan commodities. If a borrower uses such structure for other purposes such as office space or display area, the loan amount will be adjusted for the ineligible space as determined by CCC.

      (g) The FSA county committee may approve applications, if loan funds are available, up to the maximum approval amount unless the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, or the FSA State committee establishes a lower limit for county committee approval authority.

      (h) The Farm storage facility loan approval period, which is the timeframe, from approval until expiration, during which the facility must be completely and fully delivered, erected, constructed, assembled, or installed and a CCC representative has inspected and approved such facility for all eligible facility loan commodities except sugar, will expire 6 months after the date of approval unless extended in writing for an additional 6 months by the FSA State Committee. A second 6 month extension, for a total of 18 months from the original approval date, may be approved by the FSA State Committee. This authority will not be re-delegated. Sugar storage facility loan approvals will expire 8 months after the date of approval unless extended in writing for an additional 4 months by the FSA State Committee.

      (i) For sugar storage facility loans, paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section do not apply.

      (j) For sugar storage facility loans, the agency approval officials may only approve loans, subject to available funds.

#### § § 1436.10

      (a) A minimum down payment representing the difference between the net cost of the facility and the amount of the loan determined in accordance with § 1436.9 will be made by the loan applicant to the supplier or contractor before either the partial or final loan disbursements.

      (b) The down payment must be in cash unless some other form of payment is approved by CCC. The down payment may be obtained by the borrower from another lending source.

      (c) The down payment may not include any trade-in, discount, rebate, credit, deferred payment, post-dated check, or promissory note to the supplier or contractor.

      (d) The minimum down payment for an FSFL will be 5 percent for an FSFL microloan and 15 percent for all other FSFLs, with the down payment to be calculated as a percentage of net cost as specified in § 1436.9. As specified in § 1436.8, a larger down payment may be required to meet security requirements.

      § 1436.11   Disbursements and assignments.

#### § § 1436.11

      (a) At the request of the borrower, one partial disbursement of loan principal and one final loan disbursement will be available. The partial loan disbursement will be made to facilitate the purchase and construction of an eligible facility and will be made after the approved applicant has completed construction on part of the structure. County FSA personnel will inspect and verify the amount of construction completed.

      (1) The amount of the partial loan disbursement will be determined by CCC and made after the borrower provides acceptable documentation for that portion of the completed construction to the County Committee.

      (2) Security required for the amount of the partial loan disbursement will be required before the partial loan disbursement is finalized.

      (3) The final disbursement of the loan by CCC will be made after the facility has been completely and fully delivered, erected, constructed, assembled, or installed and a CCC representative has inspected and approved such facility.

      (4) All additional security needed to fully secure both the partial and final loan disbursements must be received before the final loan disbursement.

      (b) Both the partial and final loan disbursements will be made only if the borrower furnishes satisfactory evidence of the total cost of the facility and payment of all debts on the facility in excess of the amount of the loan. If deemed appropriate by CCC, the partial and final disbursement may have separate notes and separate security instruments.

      (c) Both the partial and final loan disbursement will be made jointly to the borrower and the contractor or supplier, except disbursement may be made to the borrower solely where CCC determines, based upon information made available to CCC by the borrower, that the borrower has paid the contractor or supplier all amounts that are due and owing with respect to the facility and that all applicable liens, security interests, or other encumbrances have been released.

      (d) A release of liability will be required from all contractors and suppliers providing goods and services to the loan applicant.

      (e) Loan proceeds cannot be assigned.

      (f) For sugar storage facility loans, only one disbursement will be made and such disbursement will be regarded as a final disbursement.

      (b) The interest rate for each loan will remain in effect for the term of the loan.

      (c) Each borrower on a loan application must pay a non-refundable application fee in such amount determined appropriate by CCC; the fee will be not less than $100 per borrower. The loan application fee is determined based on the cost of the fees associated with the loan, including, but not limited to, the cost to CCC for lien searches, security filings, and credit reports.

      (d) For sugar storage facility loans, paragraph (c) of this section does not apply.

      § 1436.13   Loan installments, delinquency, and acceleration of maturity date.

#### § § 1436.13

      (a) Equal installments of principal plus interest will be amortized over the loan term for purposes of setting a payment schedule. Installments are due and payable not later than the last day of each 12-month period of each of the partial and final loan disbursements, until the principal plus interest has been paid in full.

      (b) Each installment may be paid in cash, money order, wire transfer, or by personal, certified, or cashier's check. Each payment will be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.

      (c) When installments are not paid on the due date:

      (1) CCC will generally mail a demand for payment to the debtor after the due date has passed.

      (2) If the installment is not paid within 30 calendar days of the due date or if a new due date acceptable to CCC has not been established based on a financial plan submitted by the debtor, CCC may send two subsequent written demands at approximately 30 calendar day intervals unless CCC needs to take other action to protect the interests of CCC.

      (3) If the debtor files an appeal according to § 1436.18, CCC will generally cease collection action until the appeal process is complete, however, CCC may withhold any payments due the debtor and, depending on the outcome of the appeal, any payments due the debtor may later be offset and applied to reduce the indebtedness.

      (4) In lieu of a foreclosure on the collateral or the land securing a loan in the case of a delinquency, CCC may permit a rescheduling of the debt or other measures consistent with the collection of other debts under the provisions of part 1403 of this chapter. Any rescheduling or alternate repayment arrangements will be permitted only with prior approval from the Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs. Alternately, CCC may implement such other collection procedures as it deems appropriate.

      (d) A claim will be established against a borrower for any amounts remaining due after liquidation of the loan.

      (e) CCC may declare the entire indebtedness immediately due and payable if the borrower violates any of the terms and conditions of this part, fails to pay any installment on time, or breaches any of the terms and conditions of any of the instruments executed in connection with the loan, or if , during the life of the loan, the collateral is used in connection with or by any unauthorized commercial facility including, but not limited to, elevators, warehouses, dryers, processing plants, or retail or wholesale cold storage facilities.

      (f) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be taken:

      (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity that the borrower participates in, either directly or indirectly, as determined by CCC.

      (2) Against related persons or entities, irrespective of the debtor's, share, when CCC determines that the debtor has established an entity, or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the debt.

      (g) The loan may be paid in full or in part without penalty at any time before maturity.

      (h) Upon payment of a loan, CCC will release CCC's security interest in the collateral.

#### § § 1436.14

      The borrower must pay, when due, all real and personal property taxes that may affect CCC's security interest in all collateral or land securing the note evidencing the loan. To protect its interests, CCC may pay any unpaid taxes with respect to the collateral or land securing a loan made in accordance with this part, and if CCC does so, the borrower will reimburse CCC for such payment, and if unpaid by the borrower, such debt will become due immediately.

      § 1436.15   Maintenance, liability, insurance, and inspections.

#### § § 1436.15

      (a) The borrower must maintain the loan collateral in a condition suitable for the storage or handling of one or more of the facility loan commodities.

      (b) Until the loan has been repaid, the borrower will be liable for all damages to or destruction of the collateral. CCC will not assume any loss of the collateral.

      (c) CCC may conduct annual collateral inspections to insure compliance with this part. The borrower must consent to such inspection as a term of the loan and failure to supply such access will put the borrower into default.

      (d) Facilities must be insured against all perils in all cases and must also be insured against flooding if the structure is located in a flood plain, as determined by CCC. Proof of flood insurance, if required, and proof of all peril insurance, must be provided to CCC annually. CCC must be listed as a loss payee on all peril and flood insurance policies.

      (e) CCC will have rights to enter, leave, and return to the property where the facility is located. Failure of the borrower to secure such access will render a borrower ineligible for the loan and, if a loan has already been made will constitute a loan default for which the remaining balance of the loan will become immediately due and payable.

      (f) For sugar storage facility loans, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, sugar processors must also insure the contents of storage structures used as collateral for a sugar storage facility loan against all perils.

      § 1436.16   Foreclosure, liquidation, assumptions, sales or conveyance, or bankruptcy.

#### § § 1436.16

      (a) The collateral or land securing a loan may be sold by CCC whenever CCC has declared the entire indebtedness immediately due and payable under this part as follows:

      (1) If a demand for payment is not received by the due date acceptable to CCC, CCC may call the loan and initiate foreclosure proceedings by issuing a liquidation letter to the borrower.

      (2) The debtor may voluntarily agree to allow removal of the collateral to facilitate sale by signing an agreement for sale. If the debtor objects to removal of collateral, the law of the State where the collateral exists will be used to foreclose on the property.

      (3) For loans with movable collateral and no real estate lien, CCC may sell the collateral for the best price obtainable. Sales proceeds will be distributed in the following order:

      (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs associated with selling the collateral.

      (ii) Payment to junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of the General Counsel and then to the borrower or other persons as determined appropriate by that office.

      (4) For loans with non-movable or non-salable collateral, as determined by CCC, and no real estate lien, CCC may establish a claim according to 7 CFR part 1403.

      (5) For loans secured with a real estate lien, CCC may obtain an appraisal of the property. Sales proceeds will be distributed in the following order:

      (i) To CCC to satisfy the debtor's indebtedness including all costs associated with selling the collateral and the appraisal.

      (ii) To junior lien holders if approved by USDA's Office of the General Counsel; or

      (iii) To the borrower or other persons as determined appropriate by that office.

      (b) Assumption by another borrower of a farm storage facility loan is permitted subject to county committee approval and the subsequent borrower's ability to show a satisfactory credit history. An assumption of the loan may be approved when the collateral is sold by CCC to an otherwise eligible borrower, the current borrower will convey the collateral or property securing the loan to another eligible borrower, or the borrower is dead, incompetent, or missing and an eligible borrower wants to assume the loan.

      (1) Requests for approval of assumptions must be made to the county committee by the borrower, the borrower's successors, or representatives of the borrower. If approval is granted, the borrower's successors or representatives must execute a new farm storage facility note and security agreement for the balance of the term of the loan.

      (2) The principal amount of the loan will include the unpaid amount of the loan, interest computed to the date of assumption, all past due installments, and any other charges that may be required.

      (c) The borrower may voluntarily convey the collateral to CCC before repaying the loan. Before a borrower sells or conveys the facilities securing a loan without repaying the loan in full, the borrower must obtain approval for the sale or conveyance from the FSA county committee with the understanding that sale proceeds must be paid to satisfy the borrower's indebtedness to CCC.

      (d) If any significant changes are made to the legal or operating status of the farming operation with an outstanding Farm Storage Facility Loan, the borrower must do one of the following:

      (1) Find an eligible borrower or entity to assume the loan as specified in paragraph (b) of this section,

      (2) Repay the loan, or

      (3) Undergo new financial analysis, as approved and determined by CCC, to ensure CCC's interests are protected and that the current borrower is in a position to continue making the scheduled loan payments.

      (e) Remedies provided for in this section will, unless CCC determines otherwise, be subject to the administrative appeals provided for elsewhere in this part, including those that are found at § 1436.13.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1437.1   Applicability.

#### § § 1437.1

        (a) The purpose of the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) is to help manage and reduce production risks faced by producers of eligible commercial crops or other agricultural commodities during a coverage period. NAP reduces financial losses that occur when natural disasters (damaging weather or adverse natural occurrence that is an eligible cause of loss) cause a loss of expected production or actual value for value loss crops, or where producers are prevented from planting an eligible crop because of an eligible cause of loss in a coverage period.

        (b) The provisions in this part are applicable to eligible producers and eligible crops for which catastrophic risk protection is not available under subsection (b) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) and additional coverage under subsections (c) and (h) of section 508 or, if coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance.

        (c) The regulations in this part are applicable to the 2019 and subsequent crop years.

> [79 FR 74571, Dec. 15, 2014, as amended at 85 FR 12218, Mar. 2, 2020]

        § 1437.2   Administration.

#### § § 1437.2

        (a) NAP is administered under the general supervision of the Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA) (who also serves as the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Executive Vice President), and the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, (referred to as “Deputy Administrator” in this part). NAP is carried out by FSA State and county committees (State and county committees) with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.

        (b) State and county committees, and representatives and their employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations in this part, NAP's basic provisions, or instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.

        (c) The State committee will take any action required by the regulations in this part that the county committee has not taken. The State committee will also:

        (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the regulations in this part; or

        (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

        (d) No delegation to a State or county committee precludes the FSA Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or a designee, from determining any question arising under NAP or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

        (e) The Deputy Administrator has the authority to permit State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines (except deadlines specified in a law) and other requirements or program provisions not specified in law, in cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements or program provisions do not adversely affect operation of NAP.

        (1) Producers and participants have no right to a decision in response to a request to waive or modify deadlines or program provisions. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider such a request or a decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this section is not an adverse decision and is not appealable.

        (2) FSA's decision not to consider a case under this section is not a failure to act under any law or regulation because participants have no right to a decision on a request for waiver or modification.

        (f) Items including, but not limited to, application periods, application deadlines, basic provisions, internal operating guidelines issued to FSA State and county offices, coverage periods, fees, prices, yields, and payment factors established for NAP in accordance with this part that are used for similarly situated participants and eligible crops are not to be construed to be individual program eligibility determinations or extent of eligibility determinations and are, therefore, not subject to administrative review.

        (g) Where there is any conflict between the basic provisions and the regulations, the regulations apply except when the Deputy Administrator determines that because of the timing of issuance of the regulations, the basic provisions applicable to the specific crop year or coverage period that may be less restrictive will apply.

#### § § 1437.4

        (a) Noninsured crop disaster assistance is available during the coverage period specified in § 1437.6 for loss of production or loss of value for value loss crops or prevented planting of eligible commercial crops or other eligible agricultural commodities:

        (1) Planted during the planting period, which means the time during which a majority of the crop is normally planted in the area, as determined by FSA, and is considered timely-planted for NAP purposes;

        (2) Prevented from being planted during the planting period;

        (3) Planted during the late planting period, which means the time after the planting period, during which certain crops, as determined by FSA, may be planted and remain eligible for reduced NAP coverage; and

        (4) Determined by FSA to be eligible crops for which:

        (i) Catastrophic risk protection and additional coverage under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b), (c), and (h)) are not available or, if coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance; or

        (ii) These specific practices for these crops are not included under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508), but only when the Deputy Administrator determines in advance of a coverage period that the specific practice is appropriate for NAP coverage and is not available for coverage under Federal crop insurance.

        (iii) The producer applies good farming practices.

        (b) When other conditions are met, NAP may be available for an eligible loss of:

        (1) Any commercial crop grown for food, excluding livestock and their by-products;

        (2) For not more than any 4 crop years for native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of any crop after December 20, 2018:

        (i) During the first 10 crop years after the initial tillage; and

        (ii) For which a NAP applicant must submit a service fee or NAP premium for a crop on that acreage.

        (d) For acreage specified in paragraph (c) of this section:

        (1) The approved yield will be determined by using a yield equal to 65 percent of the producer's T-yield for the annually planted crop; and

        (2) The service fee or premium for the annual covered crop planted on native sod will be equal to 200 percent of the amount determined in § 1437.7, as applicable, but the premium will not exceed the maximum amount specified in § 1437.7(d)(2).

        (e) If the producer's total native sod acreage that is tilled in a crop year is 5 acres or less, the approved yield, service fee, and premium provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section will not apply.

        (f) Wheat, barley, oats, or triticale crop acreage subject to an application for grazing payments under the program specified in part 1421, subpart D of this chapter, or successor program, is ineligible for NAP payments.

        § 1437.5   Coverage levels.

#### § § 1437.5

        (a) NAP coverage for prevented planting is provided for approved prevented planting of an eligible NAP covered crop due to an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period. Payment is based on the approved prevented planted acreage in excess of 35 percent of the total intended acres to be planted.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, NAP coverage is equal to 50 percent of the yield or inventory value specified in paragraph (c) of this section at 55 percent of the average market price established by FSA.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to be eligible for a NAP payment a producer must have suffered a yield or inventory value loss greater than 50 percent as the result of an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period as follows:

        (1) For yield-based crops, a yield loss in excess of 50 percent of the approved yield;

        (2) For value loss crops, a loss of value in excess of 50 percent of the total value of eligible inventory at the time of disaster;

        (d) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, producers of eligible NAP crops, other than crops and grasses intended for grazing, may elect buy-up coverage at 100 percent of the average market price in amounts of 50 percent to 65 percent, in 5 percent increments, of:

        (1) For yield-based crops, the approved yield; and

        (2) For value loss crops, the lesser of the total value of eligible inventory at the time of disaster or the maximum dollar value for coverage sought.

        (e) A producer cannot obtain buy-up coverage for a crop if the producer has not successfully produced the crop in a previous year for which documentation exists and that documentation shows that the crop can be successfully grown by the producer in the county. Production of the crop is considered to be successful if the producer produced at least 50 percent of the county expected yield for the same county for which buy-up coverage is sought, unless the producer suffered a loss on the crop due to an eligible cause of loss in § 1437.10. If not already provided to FSA for any reason including NAP coverage or assistance, the producer must submit documentation showing successful growing of the crop in a previous year and, in the event a loss due to an eligible cause of loss was sustained, submit documentation of that loss satisfying the requirements of § 1437.11.

        (f) The quantity or value of any eligible NAP crop will not be reduced for any quality consideration unless a zero value is established based on a total loss of quality, except as specified in § 1437.105.

        (g) For crop acreage intended to be grazed, to be eligible for a NAP payment, a producer must have suffered a loss of AUD in excess of 50 percent of expected AUD determined on the basis of acreage, carrying capacity, and grazing period.

        § 1437.6   Coverage period.

#### § § 1437.6

        (a)  The coverage period is the time during which coverage is available against prevented planting, a loss of production, or loss of value, as applicable, of the eligible crop as a result of an eligible cause of loss specified in § 1437.10. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, coverage periods start no earlier than 1 calendar day after date of filing of a valid application for coverage as specified in § 1437.7.

        (1) If an application for coverage is filed within 30 calendar days of the end of a coverage period, the application for coverage is invalid and will not be processed by FSA. In the event the application for coverage is invalid as discussed in this paragraph, service fees will not be refunded.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, coverage is never retroactive.

        (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the coverage period for annual crops, including annual forage crops,

        (1) Begins the later of:

        (i) 1 calendar day after the date the application for coverage is filed; or

        (ii) The date the crop is planted, not to exceed the late planting period; and

        (2) Ends on the earlier of:

        (i) The date harvest is complete;

        (ii) The normal harvest date of the crop in the area;

        (iii) The date the crop is abandoned; or

        (iv) The date the crop is destroyed.

        (c)  Except as otherwise specified in this part, the coverage period for biennial and perennial crops begins the later of 1 calendar day after the date the application for coverage is filed or 1 calendar day after the application closing date. The coverage ends as determined by FSA.

        (d)  Except as otherwise specified in this part, the coverage period for value loss crops, including ornamental nursery, aquaculture, Christmas tree crops, ginseng, and turfgrass sod; and other eligible crops, including floriculture and mushrooms begins the later of 1 calendar day after the date the application for coverage is filed or 1 calendar day after the application closing date. The coverage ends the last day of the crop year, as determined by FSA.

        (e)  Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the coverage period for honey begins the later of 1 calendar day after the date of the application for coverage is filed; 1 calendar day after the application closing date; or the date the colonies are set in place for honey production. The coverage ends the last day of the crop year.

        (f)  Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the coverage period for maple sap begins the later of 1 calendar day after the date the application for coverage is filed or 1 calendar day  after the application closing date. The coverage ends on the earlier of the date harvest is complete; or the normal harvest date.

        (g)  Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, for biennial and perennial forage crops the coverage period begins the later of 1 calendar day after the date the application for coverage is filed or 1 calendar day after the application closing date; for first year seedings, the date the crop was planted; or the date following the normal harvest date. The coverage ends on the normal harvest date of the subsequent year.

        (h)  For the 2019 and 2020 crop years only, if a crop's application closing date is before April 8, 2019, the coverage period of the crop will be as specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section except that the date coverage begins will be retroactive as long as the application for coverage is filed by the application closing date as specified in § 1437.7(i). This limited retroactive coverage for the 2019 and 2020 crop years only will begin 1 calendar day after the established application closing date, which would be the same as if they had filed by the deadlines as specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

        § 1437.7   Application for coverage, service fee, premium, transfers of coverage, and acreage report.

#### § § 1437.7

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, with respect to each crop, commodity, or acreage, producers must file an application for coverage under this part by the application closing date.

        (b) The service fee or certification of eligibility for a service fee waiver specified in paragraph (g) of this section must accompany the application for coverage in order for it to be considered filed. The service fee is:

        (1) For applications filed by April 7, 2019, $250 per crop per administrative county, up to $750 per producer per administrative county, not to exceed $1,875 per producer; and

        (2) For applications filed on or after April 8, 2019, $325 per crop per administrative county, up to $825 per producer per administrative county, not to exceed $1,950 per producer.

        (c) The service fee will be applied per administrative county by crop and by planting period, as determined by FSA.

        (d) Producers who elect buy-up coverage must pay a premium, in addition to the service fee, equal to the lesser of:

        (1) The product obtained by multiplying:

        (i) A 5.25-percent premium fee; and

        (ii) The applicable payment limit; or

        (2) The sum of the premiums for each eligible crop, with the premium for each eligible crop obtained by multiplying:

        (i) The maximum dollar value for which coverage is sought by the applicant;

        (ii) The coverage level elected by the producer; and

        (iii) A 5.25-percent premium fee.

        (f) Premiums will be calculated separately for each crop, type, and intended use as reported on the acreage report and as specified in the basic provisions.

        (g) Beginning farmers and ranchers, limited resource farmers and ranchers, socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, and veteran farmers and ranchers will receive, upon certification, a waiver of the service fee and a 50 percent premium reduction for any buy-up coverage elected. The certification is required on or before the time the application for coverage is filed using the form specified by FSA.

        (h) Transfers of NAP coverage are governed by the basic provisions.

        (i) For the 2019 and 2020 crop years, if a crop's application closing date is before April 8, 2019, FSA will accept applications for coverage without regard to whether or not the application for coverage was filed by the crop's application closing date, provided that the application for coverage includes buy-up coverage according to § 1437.5(d) and is filed by May 24, 2019. Except as specifically stated in this rule, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply to crops having an application closing date established on or after April 8, 2019, or to applications for coverage that do not include buy-up coverage as an option selected by the applicant. The coverage period for applications for coverage filed according to this paragraph will be as specified in § 1437.6.

        (j) An accurate acreage report must be filed for each crop included on an application for coverage by the earliest of:

        (l) Applications for coverage that were filed with FSA for all crops other than hemp that were covered under the regulations in effect at the time of filing and which meet all the other requirements of this section will be recognized by FSA.

> [79 FR 74575, Dec. 15, 2014, as amended at 85 FR 12219, Mar. 2, 2020; 88 FR 1892, Jan. 11, 2023]

        § 1437.8   Records.

#### § § 1437.8

        (a) Producers must maintain accurate records of crop acreage, acreage yields, and production for the crop for which an application for coverage is filed in accordance with § 1437.7. For those crops or commodities for which it is impractical, as determined by FSA, to maintain crop acreage, yields, or production data, producers must maintain records, in addition to the available records required by this section, as may be required in subparts C, D, and E of this part. Producers must retain records of the production and acreage yield for a minimum of 3 years for each crop for which an application for coverage is filed in accordance with § 1437.7. Producers may be selected and be required to provide records acceptable to FSA to support any certification provided. For each harvested crop for which producers file an application for payment in accordance with § 1437.11, producers must provide documentary evidence acceptable to FSA of production and the date harvest was completed, including production of crops planted after the planting period or late planting period. Such documentary evidence must be provided no later than the acreage reporting date for the crop in the subsequent crop year or, for crops with a coverage period of more than 12 months, no later than 60 days after the normal harvest date. Records of a previous crop year's production for inclusion in the actual production history database used to calculate an approved yield for the current crop year must be certified by the producer no later than the acreage reporting date for the crop in the current crop year. Production data provided after the acreage reporting date in the current crop year for the crop may be included in the actual production history data base for the calculation of subsequent approved yield calculations if accompanied by acceptable records of production as determined by FSA. Certifications must be accompanied by a record of production; records of production acceptable to FSA may include:

        (1) Commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, or load summaries if the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined by FSA; and

        (2) Such documentary evidence such as contemporaneous measurements, truck scale tickets, and contemporaneous diaries, as is necessary in order to verify the information provided if the eligible crop has been fed to livestock, or otherwise disposed of other than through commercial channels, provided the records are reliable or verifiable as determined by FSA.

        (3) For quality losses specified in § 1437.105, verifiable records substantiating a quality loss due to an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period. The record submitted must come from tests or analysis substantiating that the loss of quality occurred from an eligible cause of loss during the coverage period. FSA will disapprove quality adjustments under § 1437.105 if FSA determines the evidence does not substantiate a loss of quality occurred due to an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period. For example, if FSA determines the tests or analysis of the specific crop's production were taken too late to determine if the measured loss of quality occurred from an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period (regardless whether a loss of quality was in fact measured or determined), no quality loss adjustment will be made or permitted. There is no presumption that a measured loss of quality occurred due to an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period. It is a NAP covered producer's burden to present evidence, satisfactory to FSA, substantiating that the alleged quality loss occurred to the NAP covered crop in the coverage period.

        (b) During any crop year that a notice of loss is filed according to this part:

        (1) Producers of hand-harvested or rapidly deteriorating crops, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, must, in addition to providing acceptable production records according to this part, notify the administrative county office that harvest is complete. This notification must be made within 72 hours of when harvest is complete. If an appraisal of the crop acreage is requested by the producer or determined necessary by FSA, the producer must not destroy the crop residue until the crop acreage is released by an FCIC- or FSA-qualified loss adjustor. Producers may, at their expense, request that an appraisal by certified FCIC or FSA loss adjusters of acreage of hand-harvested or rapidly deteriorating crops be completed during non-loss crop years in order to maintain accurate actual production history.

        (2) Producers must not allow the gathering (gleaning) of any produce left in the field following normal harvest of the crop acreage until the crop acreage is released by a qualified FSA or FCIC loss adjustor, as determined by FSA. Except, crop acreage may be released by an authorized FSA representative for acceptable gleaning operations, as determined by FSA, when producers and gleaners agree to provide acceptable records, as determined by FSA, of the quantity of the crop gleaned.

        (c) Producers must provide acceptable evidence, as determined by FSA, of:

        (1) An interest in the commodity produced or control of the crop acreage on which the commodity was grown at the time of disaster;

        (2) The authority of the applicable individual to execute program documents;

        (3) The producer's risk in the crop; and

        (4) The producer's ability and intent to harvest, transport, and market the crop's expected production determined by using the approved yield or inventory of the crop or commodity.

        (d) Reports of acreage planted or intended but prevented from being planted must be provided to FSA at the administrative county office for the acreage no later than the date specified by FSA for each crop and location. Reports of acreage filed beyond the date specified by FSA for the crop and location may, however, be processed and used for determining acres devoted to the eligible crop if all the provisions of 7 CFR part 718 are met. In the case of a crop-share arrangement, all producers will be bound by the acreage report filed by the landowner or operator unless the producer files a separate acreage report by the date specified by FSA for the crop and location. Reports of acreage planted or intended and prevented from being planted must include all of the following information:

        (1) Number of acres of the eligible crop in the administrative county (for each planting in the event of multiple planting) in which the producer has a share;

        (2) Zero acres planted when the producer's crop for which an application for coverage was filed, is not planted;

        (3) The producer's share of the eligible crop at the time an application for coverage was filed;

        (4) The FSA farm serial number;

        (5) The identity of the crop, practices, intended uses, and for forage crops, the predominant species or type and variety of the vegetation;

        (6) For organic crops with an average market price established under § 1437.12(b), the identity of the crop planted on:

        (i) Acreage using conventional farming practices;

        (ii) Certified organic acreage;

        (iii) Transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage;

        (iv) Buffer zone acreage;

        (7) The identity of all producers sharing in the crop;

        (8) The date the crop was planted or planting was completed, including the age of the perennial crops; and

        (9) The acreage intended but prevented from being planted.

        (e) Producers receiving a guaranteed payment for planted acreage, as opposed to receiving a payment only upon delivery of the production must provide documentation of any written or verbal contract or arrangement with the buyer to FSA. Net production, as determined by FSA, may be adjusted upward by the amount of production corresponding to the amount of the contract payment received.

        (f) Producers must provide documentation of any salvage value received by or made available for the quantity of the crop or commodity that cannot be marketed or sold in any market, as determined by FSA and any value received by or made available for a secondary use of the crop or commodity.

        (g) Producers requesting payment under this part must maintain records which substantiate gross revenue for the tax year preceding the crop year for which coverage is requested.

        (h) Producers requesting a waiver of service fees as a limited resource producer must maintain records which substantiate annual gross income for the two tax years preceding the crop year for which coverage is requested.

        (i) Producers requesting payment under this part for a crop grown on certified organic acreage for which a price and T-yield are established, as provided in §§ 1437.12(b) and 1437.102, must provide, no later than the acreage reporting date specified by FSA for the crop and location:

        (1) A written certification in effect from a certifying agency indicating the name of the entity certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (a certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement); and

        (2) Records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of certified organic, transitional, and buffer zone acreage, and acreage not subject to organic farming practices according to an organic system plan.

        (j) Producers providing reports of acreage that include transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage in accordance with an organic system plan must provide, no later than the acreage reporting date specified by FSA for the crop and location:

        § 1437.10   Causes of loss.

#### § § 1437.10

        (a) To qualify for assistance, production losses or prevented planting must occur as a result of an eligible cause of loss during the coverage period. Not all causes of loss are eligible causes of loss for all crops or all commodities.

        (b) An eligible cause of loss is:

        (1) Damaging weather, including, but not limited to:

        (i) Drought;

        (ii) Hail;

        (iii) Excessive moisture;

        (iv) Freeze;

        (v) Tornado;

        (vi) Hurricane;

        (vii) Excessive wind;

        (viii) Lightning;

        (ix) Insufficient chill hours, but only for specific crops and locations for which FSA has determined in advance of a coverage period, based on FSA's review of sufficient scientific evidence that a requisite amount of chill hours is required for the crop to produce and a lack of chill hours is adverse to the crop's production without any regard to any management. In this context, “without regard to any management” means if a crop's inability to produce due to lack of chill hours can be mitigated by any managerial practices, application of chemical, or other management intervention, the lack of chill hours will not be included as an eligible cause of loss for the crop, In cases where FSA makes the decision to include insufficient chill hours as a cause of loss by itself for a crop and location, the crop and location and subsequent crop year coverage period for which the decision will apply will be specified in a list maintained by FSA. If the crop and location is not on that list, then insufficient chill hours can only be an eligible cause of loss if the insufficient chill hours were related to a damaging weather event or an adverse natural occurrence included in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section; or

        (x) Any combination of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section;

        (2) Adverse natural occurrence, including, but not limited to:

        (i) Earthquake;

        (ii) Flood; or

        (iii) Volcanic eruption; or

        (3) A condition related to an eligible cause of loss in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section (in this context, the related condition must result from the damaging weather or adverse natural occurrence; it is not eligible if it occurs on its own) including, but not limited to:

        (i) Heat;

        (ii) Insect infestation;

        (iii) Disease;

        (iv) Insufficient chill hours;

        (v) Wildfire; or

        (vi) Any combination thereof.

        (c) The damaging weather, adverse natural occurrence, or related condition as specified in paragraph (b) of this section must occur in the coverage period before or during harvest and directly cause, accelerate, or exacerbate destruction or deterioration of the eligible crop as determined by the county committee.

        (d) NAP coverage is provided against only eligible causes of loss. All specified causes of loss must be due to a naturally occurring event during the coverage period. All other causes of loss, including, but not limited to, the following, are not covered:

        (1) Negligence, mismanagement, or wrongdoing by the NAP covered producer or anyone else;

        (2) Failure to follow recognized good farming practices for the eligible crop;

        (3) Water contained or released by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of the water;

        (4) Failure or breakdown of the irrigation equipment facilities, unless the failure or breakdown is due to an eligible cause of loss. If damage is due to an eligible cause of loss, the producer must make all reasonable efforts to restore the equipment or facilities to proper working order within a reasonable amount of time unless FSA determines it is not practical to do so. Cost will not be considered when determining whether it is practical to restore the equipment or facilities;

        (5) Failure to carry out a good irrigation practice for the covered crop, if applicable;

        (6) Any cause of loss that results in damage that is not evident or would not have been evident during the NAP coverage period. Even though FSA may not inspect the damaged crop until after the end of the NAP coverage period, only damage due to eligible causes that would have been evident during the NAP coverage period will be covered;

        (7) Except for lack of chill hours as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, normal variance of temperatures from average normal temperatures including, but not limited to, cyclic yield variations that occur for a crop that are not causes of loss included in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section;

        (8) Any managerial decision to attempt to grow or produce a crop in an area that is not suited for successful commercial production of the eligible NAP crop as determined by FSA;

        (9) Failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop during the same planting period in those areas and under such circumstances where it is customary to do so;

        (10) Except for tree crops and perennials and as provided for in § 1437.201, inadequate irrigation resources at time of planting;

        (11) Except as specified in § 1437.303, a loss of inventory or yield of aquaculture (including ornamental fish), floriculture, or ornamental nursery stemming from drought or any failure to provide water, soil, or growing media to such crop for any reason;

        (12) Any failure to provide a controlled environment or exercise good nursery practices when such controlled environment or practices are a condition of eligibility under this part;

        (13) Except as provided for mollusks in § 1437.303, any alleged or actual loss of inventory or missing non-containerized inventory resulting from a managerial decision not to seed or raise the eligible NAP crop in containers, net pens, or wire baskets, on ropes, or using similar devices;

        (14) For crops grown using organic farming practices, failure to comply with organic standards;

        (15) Contamination by application or drift of prohibited substances onto land on which crops are grown using organic farming practices;

        (16) Weeds; or

        (17) Failure to harvest or market the crop due to lack of a sufficient plan or resources.

        (e) The lack of an eligible cause of loss during a coverage period is not a compliance matter or issue. NAP will not provide assistance for crops that do not suffer from an eligible cause of loss during a coverage period. The relief provisions of these regulations and of 7 CFR part 718 cannot be used to pay producers of crops that did not suffer from an eligible cause of loss during the coverage period.

        § 1437.11   Notice of loss, appraisal requirements, and application for payment.

#### § § 1437.11

        (a) In addition to the written notice of loss requirements specified for all crops in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, for hand-harvested or rapidly deteriorating crops and for other crops determined by FSA, at least one producer having a share in the unit must notify FSA of the damage or loss through the administrative county office for the unit within 72 hours of the date damage or loss on the unit first becomes apparent. Notification required under this paragraph may be via telephone to the administrative county office during business hours or via written notice on a form prescribed by FSA as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) Unless written notice for hand-harvested or rapidly deteriorating crops has already been provided within 72 hours of date of damage or loss as specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, in case of damage to any NAP covered crop, at least one producer having a share in the unit must file a notice of loss in the administrative county office:

        (1) For prevented planting claims, within 15 days after the final planting date;

        (2) For low yield claims and value loss claims, the earlier of:

        (i) 15 days after the disaster occurrence or date of loss or damage to the crop first becomes apparent; or

        (ii) 15 days after the normal harvest date.

        (c) The notice of loss specified in paragraph (b) of this section must be for each crop and be in writing on a form prescribed by FSA and include:

        (1) The alleged cause of crop damage;

        (2) Date the disaster occurred and when the damage or loss first became apparent;

        (3) A copy of the contract or agreement if a contract or agreement of a guaranteed payment for planted acreage exists;

        (4) The type of loss that occurred, for example, prevented planting or low yield;

        (5) Practices used, for example, irrigated or non-irrigated;

        (6) For prevented planting:

        (i) Total intended planted acreage of the crop on the unit;

        (ii) Total acreage of the crop planted on the unit;

        (iii) Whether seed, chemicals, fertilizer, etc. was purchased, delivered, or an arrangement for purchase or delivery was made for the intended to be planted crop;

        (iv) What and when land preparation measures were completed, and

        (v) What has been done or will be done with the acreage, for example, abandoned, replanted, etc.;

        (7) For low yield:

        (i) Total acreage devoted to the crop in the unit;

        (ii) Total acreage of the crop affected;

        (iii) What and when land preparation measures and practices were completed before and after the loss; and

        (iv) What will be done with the affected crop acreage, for example, harvested, destroyed, replanted to a different crop, abandoned, etc.; and

        (8) Any other information requested by an FSA authorized representative.

        (d) Producers who file a notice of loss, using the appropriate FSA form, for crop acreage that will not be harvested as intended, such as abandoned, put to another use, replanted to the same or a different crop, or in the case of forage, acreage intended to be mechanically harvested that will be both mechanically harvested and grazed, must:

        (1) Not put the crop to another use or prepare the acreage for replanting or otherwise change any conditions of the crop or acreage until written notification of release of the crop or acreage is received from FSA;

        (2) Request, using the appropriate FSA form, an appraisal of the un-harvested acreage for potential production and release of the crop or acreage:

        (i) No less than 15 calendar days before replanting or in the case of forage intended to be mechanically harvested, grazing of the crop acreage.

        (ii) Within 72 hours after the acreage is abandoned for hand-harvested or rapidly deteriorating crops, or within 15 calendar days after the acreage is abandoned for all other crops;

        (iii) No later than the normal harvest date of the crop, as determined by FSA.

        (3) Request the loss adjustor on the day the initial appraisal is completed, or request in any manner of written correspondence received in the administrative county office no later than 15 calendar days after the request for initial appraisal is submitted, that the appraisal be deferred until the end of the growing season, the producer be permitted to establish representative sample areas according to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and that the acreage be released immediately when:

        (i) Time is critical for replanting, or other urgent reasons; and

        (ii) Producers and loss adjustors cannot resolve disagreement with the initial appraisal of the acreage to be released.

        (4) Establish representative sample areas of the acreage according to the loss adjustor's instructions received on the day the initial appraisal is completed or, if the loss adjustor is not available, according to the FCIC Loss Adjustment Manual (LAM) and applicable FCIC crop handbooks. Report the size, number, and location of the areas in any manner of written correspondence received in the administrative county office, no later than 15 calendar days after requesting a deferred appraisal and before the acreage is put to another use or replanted. Representative sample areas must be of adequate construction and numbers to provide acceptable sampling results and maintained in sound condition, as determined by FSA, until released by FSA.

        (5) If possible, be present for the appraisal involving un-harvested crop acreage and accept or contest the results of the loss adjustor's appraisal. Producers unable to be present for the appraisal may contest the results of the appraisal in the administrative county office.

        (e) Crop acreage for which an application for coverage has been filed, that is intended for production of forage seed and for which a notice of loss is filed indicating the crop acreage will not be harvested as seed, will be appraised for potential production of seed when producers provide FSA acceptable evidence of a contract to produce seed for the current crop year or acceptable records of acreage and seed production for three or more of the last 5 consecutive crop years, as determined by FSA.

        (f) Forage acreage for which a notice of loss is filed and:

        (1) Catastrophic coverage was obtained for forage intended to be grazed will have NAP benefits calculated based on § 1437.401(f);

        (2) Catastrophic coverage was obtained for forage that was intended to be mechanical harvested but will be grazed and not mechanical harvested;

        (i) Must have an appraisal and release for the unit to have NAP benefits calculated based on mechanical harvested forage; or

        (ii) For which an appraisal or release was not obtained, will have a loss calculated as specified in § 1437.401(f).

        (3) Buy-up coverage was obtained for forage intended to be mechanically harvested but will be grazed and not mechanically harvested:

        (i) Must have an appraisal and release in order for the unit to have NAP benefits calculated based on the loss of expected mechanically harvested forage; or

        (ii) For which an appraisal or release was not obtained is ineligible for payment consideration and will have the unit guarantee assigned to the forage crop acreage.

        (g) Producers must file an application for payment on a form specified by FSA to apply for NAP payments within 60 days of the last day of coverage for the crop year for any NAP covered crop in the unit.

        (h) A notice of loss under paragraph (a) of this section filed beyond the time specified in this section or notification provided under paragraph (b) of this section may satisfy the requirements of these provisions, if, at the discretion of FSA, the notice is filed at such time that permits:

        (1) An authorized FSA representative to verify information on the notice of loss by inspecting the affected acreage or the crop or commodity involved; and

        (2) The county committee or an authorized FSA representative the opportunity to determine that eligible disaster conditions caused the damage or loss.

        § 1437.12   Average market price and payment factors.

#### § § 1437.12

        (a) An average market price will be used to calculate assistance under this part and will be:

        (1) A dollar value per the applicable unit of measure of the eligible crop;

        (2) Determined on a harvested basis without the inclusion of transportation, storage, processing, marketing, or other post-harvest expenses, as determined by FSA;

        (3) Comparable with established FCIC prices; and

        (4) Determined, as practicable, for each intended use of a crop type within a State, as determined by FSA, for a crop year.

        (b) For each crop and location (State or county or other location as determined appropriate by FSA), FSA will establish an average market price using the following method:

        (1) Obtaining market prices for each crop for the 5 consecutive crop years beginning with the most recent year for which price data is available; then

        (2) Dropping the crop years in the 5 consecutive crop years with the highest and lowest prices; and then

        (3) Averaging the prices for the remaining 3 crop years in the 5 consecutive crop years; and

        (4) If 5 crop years of data is not available for determining the average market price, FSA will use the best data available, as determined by FSA, for as many crop years of average market price data as possible within the 5 consecutive crop years beginning with the most recent year for which price data is available and determine an average market price for the crop by computing a simple average of the prices for those years.

        (c) FSA will disregard small differences in prices for a crop based on different types or varieties or various intended uses. If FSA determines there is a significant amount of production being marketed in a location or region at significantly different prices, FSA will determine whether or not to establish different average market prices for subsequent crop years.

        (d) Separate average market prices may be established within a State based on conventional or organic practices or the intended market, as determined by FSA.

        (e) For these purposes, where needed, an Animal-unit-days (AUD) value will be based on the national average price of corn and the daily requirement of 13.6 megacalories of net energy for maintenance of 1 animal unit.

        (f) Payment factors will be used to calculate assistance for crops produced with significant and variable harvesting expenses that are not incurred because the crop acreage was prevented planted, or planted but not harvested, as determined by FSA. The imposition of payment factors is based on the acre status and disposition not whether a NAP participant actually incurs or does not incur expenses.

        (g) The average market price used to determine the amount of NAP assistance for crop acreage reported with a specific intended use will be based on the smaller of the approved average market price established for either the specific intended use reported on the acreage report or actual market or actual use for which more than 50 percent of the acreage's harvested production is marketed. For example: A producer reports 50 acres of carrots intended for fresh market and the producer suffers a 70 percent loss of production on the acreage. Additionally, more than 50 percent of the carrots actually produced from the 50 acres are sold as processed carrots. Because the established average market price for processed carrots is less than fresh carrots and more than 50 percent of the harvested crop was marketed as processed carrots, the established average market price for processed carrots will be used to compute the producer's NAP assistance. If an average market price had not been established for processed carrots in this example before the coverage period, then the average market price for fresh carrots would be used.

        (1) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to secondary use, peanuts, seed intended uses, and small grain intended for use as forage.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (h) For crops with an established yield and market price for multiple intended uses, the average market price will be as provided in paragraph (g) of this section except that for producers who choose buy-up coverage under § 1437.5(d), the average market price used to determine assistance may be based on historical production and acreage evidence provided by the participant. The evidence of actual final use of historical production must come from the 3 previous crop years immediately preceding the coverage year. Only years in which the producer had acreage and production harvested will be counted. In other words, if a producer only marketed a crop in 1 previous year, FSA will review the evidence of final use in that year and based on the evidence for that year, determine a percent of production attributable to each use. Based on that determined percentage, an appropriate average market price and use will be calculated and determined, respectively. If more than 1 and up to 3 years of final use evidence are available, FSA will count all years and production and determine the average. If a producer had crop acreage and evidence of final use for any year in the 3-year period, but the producer does not submit evidence for any other year in the 3-year period for which the producer also had acreage, the average market price will be as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (i) A final payment price will be determined by multiplying, as appropriate, the average market price determined in this section by the applicable payment factor (that is, harvested, unharvested, or prevented planting).

        § 1437.13   Crop definition.

#### § § 1437.13

        (a) For the purpose of providing benefits under this part, FSA will, at its discretion, define crops as specified in this section.

        (b) FSA may separate or combine types and varieties as a crop when specific credible information as determined by FSA is provided showing the crop of a specific type or variety has a significantly different or similar value when compared to other types or varieties, as determined by FSA.

        (c) FSA may recognize two or more different crops planted on the same acreage intended for harvest during the same crop year as two or more separate crops. The crop acreage may include a crop intended for harvest before planting of a succeeding crop or a succeeding crop interseeded with the preceding crop prior to intended harvest of the preceding crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by FSA, and all crops are recognized by FSA as able to achieve the expected yield, as determined by FSA.

        (d) FSA may consider crop acreage that is harvested more than once during the same crop year from the same plant as a single crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by FSA.

        (e) FSA may consider each planting period of multiple planted acreage as a separate crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by FSA.

        (f) FSA may define forage as separate crops according to the intended method of harvest, either mechanical harvest or grazed.

        (g) Forage acreage intended to be grazed may be further defined as warm and cool season forage crops.

        (h) Forage acreage intended to be mechanically harvested may be defined as a separate crop from grazed forage and may be separated based upon the commodity used as forage, to the extent such separation is allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (i) Crop acreage intended for the production of seed may be considered a separate crop from other intended uses, as determined by FSA, if all the following criteria apply:

        (1) The specific crop acreage is seeded, or intended to be seeded, with an intent of producing commercial seed as its primary intended use;

        (2) There is no possibility of other commercial uses of production from the same crop without regard to market conditions; and

        (3) The growing period of the specific crop acreage is uniquely conducive to the production of commercial seed and not conducive to the production of any other intended use of the crop, (e.g. vernalization in a biennial crop such as carrots and onions) and that accommodation renders the possibility of production for any other intended use of the crop improbable.

        § 1437.14   Multiple benefits.

#### § § 1437.14

        (a) If a producer is eligible to receive payments under this part and benefits under any other program administered by the Secretary for the same crop loss, the producer must choose whether to receive the other program benefits or payments under this part, but will not be eligible for both. The limitation on multiple benefits prohibits a producer from being compensated more than once for the same loss.

        (b) The limitation on multiple benefits specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to:

        (1) Emergency Loans made under subtitle C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961-1970).

        (2) Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) payments as specified in part 1416 of this chapter,

        (3) Tree Assistance Program (TAP) payments as specified in part 1416 of this chapter, or

        (4) Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) payments as specified in part 1416 of this chapter.

        (c) The restriction on multiple benefits does not relieve the producer from the requirements of making a production and acreage report.

        (d) If the other USDA program benefits are not available until after an application for benefits has been filed under this part, the producer may, to avoid this restriction on such other benefits, refund the total amount of the payment to the administrative county office from which the payment was received.

#### § § 1437.15

        (a) The provisions of part 1400 of this title apply to NAP.

        (b) CCC will pay, for up to one year, simple interest on payments to producers which are delayed. Interest will be paid on the net amount ultimately found to be due, and will begin accruing on the 31st day after the date the producer signs, dates, and submits a properly completed application for payment on the designated form, or the 31st day after a disputed application is adjudicated. Interest will be paid unless the reason for failure to timely pay is due to the producer's failure to provide information or other material necessary for the computation of payment, or there was a genuine dispute concerning eligibility for payment.

        § 1437.16   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1437.16

        (a) To be eligible for benefits under this part, producers must be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetlands provisions of part 12 of this title.

        (b) The provisions of § 718.11 of this title, providing for ineligibility for benefits for offenses involving controlled substances, apply.

        (c) A person is ineligible to receive assistance under this part for the crop year plus two subsequent crop years if it is determined by the State or county committee or an official of FSA that such person has:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the purpose of a program operated under this part;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation with respect to such program; or

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

        (d) All amounts paid by FSA to any such producer, applicable to the crop year in which a violation of this part occurs, must be refunded to FSA together with interest and other amounts as determined appropriate to the circumstances by FSA. FSA may assess liquidated damages of 10 percent of the projected or received NAP payment for the crop or commodity in violation. Liquidated damages are in addition to any refund of program benefits and are not considered a penalty.

        (e) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving benefits under this part are jointly and severally liable for any refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due FSA for any reason under this part.

        (f) In the event that any request for assistance or payments under this part was established as result of erroneous information or a miscalculation, the assistance or payment will be recalculated and any excess refunded with applicable interest.

        (g) The liability of any person for any penalty under this part is in addition to any other liability under any civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law.

        (h) The appeal regulations at parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to decisions made according to this part.

        (i) Any payment or portion thereof to any person will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof.

        (j) For the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 3201(e), the Secretary waives the ineligibility to receive benefits under this program but only for beneficiaries who as a condition of such waiver agree to apply the benefits to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (k) The provisions of parts 1400, 1403 and 1404 of this chapter apply to NAP.

        (l) In the case of death, incompetence or disappearance of any person who is eligible to receive payments under this part, such payments will be disbursed in accordance with part 707 of this title.

        (m) Any person or legal entity who has a debt from nonpayment of the premium for coverage levels specified in § 1437.5(c) will be ineligible for assistance under any subsequent crop year NAP coverage on any crop from the crop year of nonpayment of premium until the debt is paid in full.

        (1) If a person or legal entity is ineligible for NAP assistance due to the debt because of the nonpayment of premium, FSA will permit the person or legal entity to file an application for coverage together with payment of any service fees; however, that application and payment of service fees will not make the person or legal entity eligible for any assistance until the premium debt is paid in full.

        (2) Service fees paid with applications for coverage that are filed by persons or legal entities who are ineligible for NAP assistance as specified in paragraph (m) of this section will not be credited to any unpaid premium debt nor are they refundable.

        (n) A person or legal entity ineligible for NAP assistance under paragraph (m) of this section may become eligible for future NAP assistance if they remit all unpaid debt related to the nonpayment of premium before the application for payment filing deadline (see § 1437.11(g)).

        (o) Any NAP payment that was not issued for a prior NAP crop year due to an outstanding debt as specified in paragraph (m) of this section will not be issued.

        (p) Unpaid debt related to the failure to pay any premium satisfied by administrative offset will reinstate the eligibility of a person or legal entity from the date the offset satisfies all the unpaid premium debt with interest.

      Subpart B—Determining Yield Coverage Using Actual Production History

        § 1437.101   Actual production history.

#### § § 1437.101

        Actual production history (APH) is the unit's record of crop yield by crop year for the APH base period. The APH base period consists of ten crop years of actual yield, T-yield, assigned yield, and zero credited yield, immediately preceding the crop year for which an approved yield is calculated in accordance with this part. APH will be used, except as otherwise indicated in this part, as the basis for providing noninsured crop disaster assistance.

> [71 FR 13744, Mar. 17, 2006]

        § 1437.102   Yield determinations.

#### § § 1437.102

        (a) An actual yield is the total amount of harvested and appraised production from unit acreage for the crop year on a per-acre, or other basis, as applicable.

        (b) A T-yield (county expected yield):

        (1) Is the Olympic average (disregarding the high and low yields) of historical yields of the crop in the county for the five consecutive crop years immediately preceding the previous crop year. For example, for the 2015 crop year, the five consecutive crop years immediately preceding the previous crop year would be 2009 through 2013.

        (2) Will be the same as the FCIC transitional yield if crop insurance is available for the crop, (but not necessarily for the cause of loss if excluded by policy provisions), in the administrative county.

        (3) Will be calculated so as to be comparable to the FCIC transitional yield most reasonable to the area if crop insurance was available for the crop (but not necessarily for the cause of loss) in contiguous counties, but not in the immediate county.

        (4) Will be based on the most representative available historical information, as determined by FSA, from such sources as, but not limited to, actual acreage and production data of participating producers in the county; or in similar areas; National Agricultural Statistics Service data; National Institute of Food and Agriculture records, Federal Crop Insurance data, and credible non-government studies. Such data is based on the acreage intended for harvest.

        (5) May be adjusted on an administrative county-wide basis for:

        (i) Yield variations due to different farming practices in the administrative county such as irrigated and non-irrigated; and

        (ii) Cultural practices when such practices in the administrative county are different from those used on acreage to establish the yield.

        (6) Will be adjusted on a State-wide basis, for crops grown on certified organic and transitional acreage for which FSA has established a separate organic price as specified in § 1437.12(b), based on an average of FCIC organic yield reductions, as determined by FSA, for the same crop in the same State.

        (7) May be adjusted on a county-wide or regional basis for crops grown on certified organic and transitional acreage for which FSA has established a separate organic price as specified in § 1437.12(b), based on the most representative available historical information, as determined by FSA.

        (8) Will, for all land for those producers who have land physically located in multiple counties and administered in one county office, be based on the administrative county's expected yield for the crop.

        (9) May be reduced, on a specific APH basis, when, as determined by FSA, it does not accurately reflect the productive capability of specific crop acreage.

        (10) Will be used in the actual production history base period when less than four consecutive crop years of actual, assigned, or zero-credited yields, as applicable, are available.

        (c) An assigned yield is:

        (1) Equal to 75 percent of the approved yield calculated for the most recent crop year for which the producer did not certify a report of production in a crop year that is not a bypass year.

        (2) Used, after the first crop year an approved yield for the crop is calculated, in the actual production history base period when the producer reports acreage for the crop but fails to certify a report of production in a crop year that is not a bypass year. Producers may have only one assigned yield in the actual production history base period.

        (3) May be replaced with an actual yield when the producers provide a certification of production and acceptable production records for the applicable crop year in accordance with § 1437.8.

        (4) May not be used if the acreage of a crop in the administrative county in which the unit is located for the crop year increases by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding seven crop years, or significantly from the previous crop years, as determined by FSA, unless producers provide:

        (i) Detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which the producer is requesting assistance, or

        (ii) If FSA determines the documentation is inadequate, proof that the eligible crop, had it been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

        (5) May be used, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if:

        (i) The planted acreage for the crop has been inspected by a third party acceptable to FSA, or

        (ii) The FSA county executive director, with the concurrence of the FSA state executive director, makes a recommendation for an exemption from the requirements and FSA approves such recommendation.

        (d) A zero-credited yield:

        (1) Will be used in the applicable crop year of the actual production history base period for each crop year following the crop year containing an assigned yield, for which producers do not certify a report of acreage or production in a crop year that is not a bypass year, as determined by CCC.

        (2) May be replaced with an actual yield when the producer provides a certification of production and acceptable production records for the applicable crop year in accordance with § 1437.8.

        (e) An approved yield:

        (1) Is used in the calculation of the requisite loss and payment.

        (2) Is a simple average of a minimum of four base period crop year yields, , actual yield, T-yield, assigned yield, or zero-credited yield. The base period is 10 crop years, except 5 crop years for apples and peaches, immediately preceding the crop year for which an approved yield is calculated, not including any crop year the crop was out of rotation, not planted, or prevented from being planted.

        (3) Will be calculated according to the following criteria when the producer does not have at least four consecutive crop years of actual, assigned, or zero credited yields beginning with the most recent crop year.

        (i) If there are no certified acceptable production records of actual production for the most recent crop year, or zero credited or assigned yields in the producer's APH base period, and no formula provided for the producer under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) through (iv) of this section, then the approved yield for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of 65 percent of the applicable T-yield for each of the minimum four APH crop years.

        (ii) If certified acceptable production records of actual production are available for only the most recent crop year and there are no zero credited or assigned yields in the producer's APH base period, the approved yield for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the one actual yield plus 80 percent of the applicable T-yield for the remaining three of the minimum four APH crop years.

        (iii) If certified acceptable production records of actual production are available for only the two most recent crop years and there are no zero credited or assigned yields in the producer's APH base period, the approved yield for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the two actual yields plus 90 percent of the applicable T-yield for the remaining two of the minimum four APH crop years.

        (iv) If certified acceptable production records of actual production are available for only the three most recent crop years and there are no zero credited or assigned yields in the producer's APH base period, the approved yield for the current crop year will be calculated on the simple average of the three actual yields plus 100 percent of the applicable T-yield for the remaining crop year of the minimum four APH crop years.

        (f) If, for one or more actual production history crop years used to establish the approved yield, the actual or appraised yield is less than 65 percent of the current crop year T-yield due to losses incurred in a disaster year, as determined by FSA, producers may request FSA replace the applicable yield with a yield equal to 65 percent of the current crop year T-yield.

        (g) If approved yields were calculated for any of the 1995 through 2014 crop years, and subsequently in that period production was not certified, producers may request FSA replace the missing yields for such years with yields equal to the higher of 65 percent of the current crop year T-yield or the missing crop years actual yield.

        (h) If producers add land in the farming operation and do not have available production records for the added land FSA will calculate an approved yield for the new unit by utilizing the actual production history yields for the existing unit. In the event the crop suffers a loss greater than the unit guarantee for the crop year and unit acreage has increased by more than 75 percent of the historical average acreage, FSA may adjust the approved yield, as determined by FSA.

        (i) If a producer is a new producer, the approved yield may be based on unadjusted T-Yields or a combination of actual yields and unadjusted T-Yields. A new producer is a person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the eligible crop in the administrative county for more than two APH crop years. Formation or dissolution of an entity which includes individuals with more than two APH crop years of production history during the base period does not qualify the new entity as a new producer for APH determination purposes.

        (j) A producer who has not shared in the risk of the production of the crop for more than two crop years during the base period, as determined by FSA, will have an approved yield calculated based on a combination of 100 percent of the applicable T-yield and any actual yield for the minimum crop years of the producer's APH base period. Producers who have produced the crop for one or more crop years must provide FSA, at the administrative county office serving the area in which the crop is located, a certification of production and production records for the applicable crop years as specified in § 1437.8.

        (k) Further adjustments may be made as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this program.

        § 1437.103   Late-planted acreage.

#### § § 1437.103

        (a) Producers planting crop acreage after the final planting date and during the late planting period, as determined by FSA, may be eligible for reduced coverage as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b) Crops with multiple planting periods and value loss crops are not eligible for reduced coverage for late planting. Exceptions to this are the last planting period of multiple planted crops and multiple-planting periods having a defined gap of 60 days or more between harvest date of the previous planting period and beginning of the immediately following planting period.

        (c) For crops with a growing period of:

        (1) 60 days or less and planted:

        (i) From 1 to 5 calendar days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to 5 percent of unit expected production for each day the crop is actually planted after the final planting date;

        (ii) From 6 days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to the unit guarantee for the late planted crop acreage.

        (2) 61 to 120 calendar days and planted:

        (i) From 1 to 5 calendar days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to 5 percent of expected unit production of the applicable late-planted crop acreage and for days 6 through 20 an additional 1 percent for each day the crop is planted after the final planting date;

        (ii) From 21 days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to the unit guarantee for the late planted crop acreage.

        (3) 121 calendar days or more and planted:

        (i) From 1 to 5 calendar days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to 5 percent of expected production of the applicable late-planted crop acreage and for days 6 through 25 an additional 1 percent for each day the crop is planted after the final planting date.

        (ii) From 26 or more calendar days after the final planting date, production will be assigned equal to unit guarantee of the producer's expected production of the applicable late-planted crop acreage.

        § 1437.104   Assigned production.

#### § § 1437.104

        (a) When determining losses under this section, assigned production will be used to offset the loss of production when, as determined by FSA, any of the following has occurred:

        (1) The loss is a result of an ineligible cause of loss and the loss has not been otherwise accounted for.

        (2) The unit acreage was destroyed without consent notwithstanding § 1437.11(e).

        (3) The producer has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for all or a portion of the production, as opposed to or regardless of delivery of such production.

        (4) The crop is planted after the STC-established final planting date according to § 1437.103.

        (5) Irrigation equipment is not capable of supplying adequate water to sustain the expected production of a normal irrigated crop.

        (6) For normal irrigated annual, biennial, and perennial crops, the irrigation practice is not used.

        (7) For normal irrigated annual and biennial crops, the supply of available water at the beginning of the crop year is not adequate.

        (8) For normal irrigated perennial crops, the supply of available water at the beginning of the crop year is not adequate as a result of an ineligible cause of loss.

        § 1437.105   Determining payments for low yield.

#### § § 1437.105

        (a) Except to the extent that the loss calculation provisions of other subparts apply, and subject to limitations set out elsewhere in this part and in this title and to the availability of funds, payments under this part will be made on eligible crops with eligible losses by:

        (1) Multiplying the total acres devoted to the eligible crop by the producers share, and subject to provisions for specific crops provided elsewhere in this part;

        (2) Multiplying the product of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 50, 55, 60, or 65 percent, as selected by the producer as specified in § 1437.5; of the approved yield per acre for the commodity for the producer.

        (3) Multiplying the net production of the total eligible acreage by the producer's share;

        (4) Subtracting the product of paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the product of paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

        (5) Multiplying the amount calculated as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 55 or 100 percent (selected by the producer as specified in § 1437.5) of the final payment price calculated as specified in § 1437.12; and

        (6) Adding the producer's share of any salvage value and secondary use and subtracting the result from the result of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

        (b) Further adjustments may be made as needed to accomplish the purposes and goals of the program.

        (c) The crops and locations eligible for quality adjustments will be determined by the Deputy Administrator in advance of the coverage period, only if supporting documentation of industry standards for quality adjustments are available. For specific crops and locations determined by the Deputy Administrator for which buy-up coverage under § 1437.5(d) is elected and for which adjustments to net production based on quality losses will be authorized for a coverage period in accordance with this paragraph, producers may opt for an adjustment of net production of a covered crop as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section based on a specific measure of quality against a set of standards that are acceptable to FSA. The standards and permissible adjustments to net production based on alleged quality losses stemming from eligible causes of loss in a coverage period will be based on FSA's review of sufficient documentation and are subject to FSA acceptance and State committee recommendation to the Deputy Administrator. The crops and locations where quality adjustments will be permitted will be as specified on a list maintained by FSA.

        (d) Production will not be adjusted under this section unless all other provisions of this section are met and the crop and location are included on a list of approved crops and locations before the beginning of the coverage period for the crop.

        (e) A producer of a NAP covered crop in a location and coverage period approved by FSA as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section who opts for the quality loss adjustment option must submit verifiable records obtained by testing or analysis of the specific crop's production and the alleged loss of quality stemming from an eligible cause of loss in the coverage period. Records must meet requirements of § 1437.8(a)(3).

        (f) If a quality adjustment option is sought by a producer and approved for a crop year, FSA will enter the adjusted value of net production into the producer's actual production history yield database for the loss year. The lower actual yield that results from the quality adjustment will be used for future approved yield calculations.

        § 1437.107   Maple sap.

#### § § 1437.107

        (a) NAP assistance for maple sap is limited to maple sap produced on private property for sale as sap or syrup. Eligible maple sap must be produced from trees that:

        (1) Are located on land the producer controls by ownership or lease;

        (2) Are managed for production of maple sap;

        (3) Are at least 30 years old and 12 inches in diameter; and

        (4) Have a maximum of 4 taps per tree according to the tree's diameter.

        (b) The crop year for maple sap production is the calendar year, January 1 through December 31.

        (c) If producers file an application for coverage in accordance with § 1437.7, tree acreage containing trees from which maple sap is produced or is to be produced must be reported to FSA no later than the beginning of the crop year.

        (d) In addition to the applicable records required under § 1437.8, producers must report the:

        (1) Total number of eligible trees on the unit;

        (2) Average size and age of producing trees; and

        (3) Total number of taps placed or anticipated for the tapping season.

        (e) A maximum county-expected-yield for maple sap is 10 gallons of sap per tap per crop year unless acceptable documentary evidence, as determined by FSA, is available to FSA to support a higher county-expected-yield.

        (f) The average market price for maple sap must be established for the value of the sap before processing into syrup. If price data is available only for maple syrup, this data must be converted to a maple sap basis. The wholesale price for a gallon of maple syrup is multiplied by 0.00936 to arrive at the average market price of a gallon of maple sap.

        (g) The actual production history for maple sap will be recorded on the basis of gallons of sap per tap.

        (h) The unit's expected production is determined by:

        (1) Multiplying the number of taps placed in eligible trees; by

        (2) The approved per tap yield as determined in accordance with § 1437.102.

        (i) Payments will be based on the amount of losses for this community based on the applicable guarantee at a rate determined in accord with this part and the authorizing legislation.

        (j) Premiums for coverage levels specified in § 1437.5(c) will be calculated based on the number of taps reported by the producer.

      Subpart E—Determining Coverage of Forage Intended for Animal Consumption

        § 1437.401   Forage.

#### § § 1437.401

        (a) Forage eligible for benefits under this part is limited to mature vegetation, as determined by FSA, produced in a commercial operation. Benefits are not available for first-year seeding of alfalfa and similar vegetation when production is not produced in the seeding year, as determined by FSA. The commercial operation must use acceptable farming, pasture, and range management practices for the location necessary to sustain sufficient quality and quantity of the vegetation so as to be suitable for grazing livestock or mechanical harvest as hay or seed. Forage to be mechanically harvested will be treated under the rules for low-yield crops as calculated under § 1437.103, except claims on forage for grazing benefits will be determined according to paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions in this subpart apply to all claims including forage for mechanical harvest.

        (b) Producers of forage must, in addition to the records required in § 1437.8, specify the intended method of harvest of all acreage intended as forage for livestock consumption as either mechanically or grazed.

        (c) Producers must request an appraisal from the administrative county office for the unit prior to the onset of grazing of any intended mechanically harvested forage acreage that will be both mechanically harvested and grazed.

        (d) Forage acreage reported to FSA as intended to be mechanically harvested, but which is instead subsequently grazed, will be considered for crop definition purposes as mechanically harvested. Expected production of the specific acreage for which catastrophic coverage was obtained will be calculated on the basis of carrying capacity. The loss of such grazed forage will be determined according to paragraph (f) of this section. For acreage intended to be mechanically harvested which is instead subsequently grazed, the loss of intended mechanically harvested forage may alternatively be determined based on a review of acceptable production evidence or appraisal of the specific crop acreage. As part of the payment computation for this loss, intended mechanically harvested forage crop acreage that is not mechanically harvested but instead grazed will be deemed to be un-harvested for the purposes of determining a payment factor.

        (e) Small grain forage is the specific acreage of wheat, barley, oats, triticale, or rye intended for use as forage. Small grain forage is a separate crop and distinct from any other forage commodities and other intended uses of the small grain commodity. In addition to the records required in § 1437.8, producers must specify whether the intended forage crop is intended for fall and winter, spring, or full season forage. In addition to other eligibility requirements, FSA will consider other factors, such as water sources and available fencing, and adequate fertilization to determine small grain forage eligibility, yields, and production.

        (f) FSA will establish forage losses of acreage intended to be grazed including, in some cases, acreage intended to be mechanically harvested but instead subsequently grazed for producers with catastrophic coverage, on the basis of:

        (1) The percentage of loss of similar mechanically-harvested forage acreage on the farm, or on similar farms in the area when approved yields have been calculated to determine loss; or

        (2) Where there is no similar mechanically-harvested forage acreage on the farm or similar farms in the area, the collective percentage of loss as determined by FSA for the geographical region after consideration of at least two independent assessments of grazed forage acreage conditions, or by alternative methods as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (i) The assessments must be completed by forage or range specialists in Federal, State, and local government agencies, educational institutions, and private companies not having a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment. Collective percentage of loss determined by FSA for the geographical region may be based on any or all the following methods as may be available and as determined appropriate by the Deputy Administrator:

        (A) Independent assessments of grazed forage acreage conditions;

        (B) The U.S. Drought Monitor;

        (C) Information obtained from loss adjusters with sufficient forage knowledge to provide grazing loss assessments;

        (D) Data obtained from approved areas where clippings are obtained on a regular basis to compare with expected levels of production in a geographical region; or

        (E) Information from Natural Resources Conservation Service technical service providers having a specialized knowledge.

        (ii) Neither the assessments themselves, nor collective loss percentages established in accordance with this section are subject to appeal. FSA's determinations of geographical area for assessments and collective grazing loss are generally applicable to all similarly situated participants farming in such defined geographical region.

        (g) For those NAP covered participants who seek to have a NAP payment determined based on paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a notice of loss under § 1437.11 will not be required; only an application for payment must be filed. Unless otherwise expressed by the NAP covered participant, FSA will presume the participant to want assistance for grazed forage determined according to paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

        (1) Multiple carrying capacities may be determined for a specific vegetation if factors, such as soil type, elevation, and topography, result in a significant difference of carrying capacity within the county.

        (2) FSA may establish separate carrying capacities for irrigated and non-irrigated forage acreage when acreage of traditionally irrigated forage (forage actually irrigated 3 of the last 5 crop years) is present in the county.

        (b) Producers may provide evidence that unit forage management and maintenance practices are improvements over those practices generally associated with the established carrying capacity. Based on this evidence, FSA may adjust the expected AUD for the specific forage acreage with catastrophic coverage upward for the crop year NAP assistance is requested by:

        (1) Three percent when at least 1 practice was completed at least 1 time in the previous 5 crop years and such practice can be expected to have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop year NAP assistance is requested;

        (2) Five percent when 2 or more practices were completed at least 1 time in the previous 5 crop years and such practices can be expected to have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop year NAP assistance is requested; and

        (3) Greater than 5 percent when producers provide acceptable records, as determined by FSA, of higher forage production or an increase in animal units supported on the specific forage acreage in 3 of the 5 crop years immediately before the crop year NAP assistance is requested.

        § 1437.403   Determining payments.

#### § § 1437.403

        (a) Subject to payment limits, availability of funds, and other limits as may apply, payments for catastrophic coverage of losses of forage reported to FSA as intended to be grazed will be determined by:

        (1) Multiplying the eligible acreage by the producer's share;

        (2) Dividing the result from paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the carrying capacity or adjusted per day carrying capacity established for the specific catastrophic coverage acreage, as determined by FSA;

        (3) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the number of days established as the grazing period;

        (4) Adding adjustments of AUD for practices and production to the product of paragraph (a)(3) of this section;

        (5) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the applicable percentage of loss established by FSA;

        (6) Multiplying the amount of assigned AUD, as determined by FSA, by the producer's share;

        (7) Subtracting the result from paragraph (a)(6) of this section from the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section;

        (8) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 0.50;

        (9) Subtracting the result from paragraph (a)(8) of this section from the result from paragraph (a)(7) of this section; and

        (10) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(9) of this section by 55 percent of the final payment price established in accordance with § 1437.12.

      Subpart F—Determining Coverage in the Tropical Region

**Source:** Source: 71 FR 52739, Sept. 7, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1437.501   Applicability; definition of “tropical region” and additional definitions.

#### § § 1437.501

        (a) This subpart applies to covered tropical crops in the tropical region, as those terms are defined in this subpart. Benefits under this part may be extended to those crops only to the extent that they are otherwise eligible for assistance under this part. Covered crops do not include “value loss” crops, as defined elsewhere in this part. For those crops that are covered by this subpart, loss and payment determinations for NAP covered in this part are determined by the rules that otherwise apply to NAP subject to the modifications provided by this subpart. The rules that otherwise apply include, but are not limited to, limitations on payments that are specified in part 1400 of this chapter.

        (b) For purposes of this subpart:

        (1)  includes, as may be further limited by the Deputy Administrator: Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States. Other areas may be included as determined by the Deputy Administrator to be required by law. References to specific areas elsewhere in this subpart will not limit the ability of the Deputy Administrator to limit the geographic scope of this subpart.

        (2)  means those crops and commodities in the tropical region governed by this subpart, those being all crops and commodities in the tropical region that are otherwise eligible for generating a benefit claim under this part, except for value-loss crops as defined elsewhere in this part.

        (c) The Deputy Administrator may adjust requirements for assistance so as to provide a fair transition from previous rules for crop covered by this subpart to those provisions which are provided for in this subpart.

        § 1437.502   Coverage periods and fees for covered tropical crops.

#### § § 1437.502

        (a) The crop year for all covered tropical crops is the calendar year (January 1 through December 31).

        (b) The application closing date for all covered tropical crops is December 31 of the calendar year before the applicable crop year.

        (c) For covered tropical crops, the maximum service fee per crop per county provided at § 1437.7 is required of the producer for coverage of:

        (1) With respect to annual and biennial crops, all plantings of the same crop planted during the crop year, as determined by FSA.

        (2) With respect to perennial crops, all acreage of the crop existing during the crop year, as determined by FSA.

        (d) Multiple planting periods and final planting dates are not applicable for covered tropical crops. However, nothing in this section will be interpreted to prohibit assigning different production expectations to different fields.

        (e) The coverage period for perennial and other crops covered by this subpart begins on January 1 of the relevant crop year and ends on December 31 of that year.

        § 1437.503   Covered losses and recordkeeping requirements for covered tropical crops.

#### § § 1437.503

        (a) Prevented planting coverage is not available for covered tropical crops.

        (b) Except in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other areas approved by the Deputy Administrator, or as otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator in individual cases, eligible causes of loss for covered tropical crops will only include hurricanes, typhoons, and named tropical storms.

        (c) Producers who have applied for coverage on covered tropical crops must maintain for the full coverage period contemporaneous records. Contemporaneous records are those created at the time of planting and harvesting of the crop for which the application for coverage is filed. In this regard:

        (1) Producers may be selected on a random or targeted basis for compliance review with this requirement and any other requirements that may apply to this program.

        (2) A failure to maintain acceptable contemporaneous records throughout the crop year may be treated by FSA as grounds of ineligibility for benefits under this part.

        § 1437.504   Notice of loss for covered tropical crops.

#### § § 1437.504

        (a) The provisions of § 1437.11(d) regarding late filed notice of loss do not apply to covered tropical crops.

        (b) Where a notice of loss for covered tropical crops is provided according to § 1437.11, producers must provide records maintained according to § 1437.503(c) of the:

        (1) Number of acres or other basis of measurement, as applicable, of the crop from which production could be achieved existing on the day the eligible natural disaster occurred or, for prolonged natural disasters, such as a drought and similar damage where applicable, existing on the day the notice of loss is filed.

        (2) Amount, including zero, as applicable, of production harvested, before or after the disaster, from those crop plantings (damaged or undamaged) which were in existence on the farm at the time of the disaster including production from the covered plantings (in existence at the time of the loss event) that may occur after the loss event even when, to the extent provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, the harvest occurs after the end of the crop year. Crop acreage of the covered crop that is in existence at the time of the loss event that can be harvested after the eligible natural disaster must be harvested, or continue to be harvested, and the harvested acres and production reported to FSA according to this subpart, except that for perennial crops the requirement ends with the end of the crop year. For non-perennial crops the obligation to harvest ends with the end of the life-cycle for the plantings that were in existence at the time of the loss event. In this regard:

        (i) Except as otherwise determined by FSA, such production, before or after the loss event, will be taken into account in computing eligibilities.

        (ii) Production that must be reported under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section includes, except in the case of perennial plants, all production irrespective of whether the production occurs in the same crop year.

        (iii) For perennial plants, only production in the same crop year must be reported.

        (iv) All production that must be reported for covered tropical crops will, except as specified by the Deputy Administrator, be taken into account in the loss determinations made under this part. The producer is obligated to maximize that production. That is, harvesting and other production activities for the plants in the ground at the time of the disaster must be undertaken or continue to be undertaken, to the maximum extent possible, for the full reporting period, that being the period for which production could count against a loss as indicated in this subpart.

        (3) Failure to keep sufficient records to allow the computations provided for in this subpart is grounds for denial of the claim.

        (c) Producers with coverage of a covered tropical crop for a crop year must, by the earlier of 90 calendar days after the crop year ends or the date a notice of loss is filed, file a certified report setting out the:

        (1) Collective acres of the crop acreage planted or in the ground during the crop year.

        (2) Total production harvested from the crop acreage for the full crop year in the case of a perennial plant and for the full life of the plants for other crops.

        (d) With respect to the report required in paragraph (c) of this section:

        (1) If a report is filed before the end of the crop year, an updated crop report must be filed within 90 calendar days from the end of the crop year to supplement the original report;

        (2) If the report is for any annual or biennial crops where production continued or could have continued beyond the period covered in the reports otherwise filed under this section, an additional report of production must be filed within 30 days of the end of the last countable production for the covered crop or 30 days after the last date on which such production could have been obtained, whichever is later.

        (3) A failure to file an adequate report where a report is required by this section may result in the producer being treated as having a zero yield capability for the crop year involved for purposes of constructing a crop history. Alternatively, the Deputy Administrator may assign another sanction for that failure. In addition to other sanctions as may apply, a failure to file such reports may be grounds for denial of a claim. The Deputy Administrator may adjust crop histories as determined appropriate to create, to the extent practicable, an appropriate crop history for loss computation purposes.

        (4) Such reports as are provided for in this subsection must be filed for every crop year for which there is coverage, irrespective of whether a claim is filed for that year.

        (e) Unless otherwise specified by the Deputy Administrator, appraisals are not required of crop acreage for covered tropical crops on Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        (f) All crop acreage for covered tropical crops for which a notice of loss is filed must not be destroyed until authorized by FSA.

        § 1437.505   Application for payment for the tropical region.

#### § § 1437.505

        (a) For producers of covered tropical crops, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or approved in individual cases by the Deputy Administrator, an application for payment must be filed at the same time as the filing of the notice of loss required under §§ 1437.11 and 1437.504.

        (b) For producers in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianna Islands, an application for payment for such crops must be filed by the later of:

        (1) The date on which the notice of loss is filed in accordance with §§ 1437.11 and 1437.504, or

        (2) The date of the completion of harvest for the specific crop acreage that existed at the time of loss for which the notice of loss was filed.

      Subpart A—Common Provisions

        § 1450.1   Administration.

#### § § 1450.1

        (a) The regulations in this part are administered under the general supervision and direction of the Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), or a designee. In the field, the regulations in this part will be implemented by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) State and county committees (“State committees” and “county committees,” respectively).

        (b) State executive directors, county executive directors, and State and county committees do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the provisions in this part unless specifically authorized by the FSA Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (Deputy Administrator).

        (c) The State committee may take any action authorized or required by this part to be taken by the county committee, but which has not been taken by such committee, such as:

        (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; or

        (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

        (d) No delegation of authority to a State or county committee will preclude the Executive Vice President, CCC, or a designee, from determining any question arising under this part or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

        (e) Data furnished by participants will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, the failure to provide data could result in program benefits being withheld or denied.

        (f) Subject to the availability of funds and all other eligibility provisions of this part, this part provides the terms, conditions and requirements of BCAP. In the event that CCC determines that available funds are insufficient to accommodate the demand for establishment and annual payments as well as all potential applications for matching payments for collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material, without any advance notice other than that stated here, CCC may prioritize the expenditure of program funds in favor of funding for the selection of BCAP project areas and the establishment and annual payments related to those project areas, and may make such other priorities in approvals that will, in the determination of the Deputy Administrator, advance the purposes of BCAP.

#### § § 1450.3

        (a) The objectives of BCAP are to:

        (1) Support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy and biobased products in selected project areas; and

        (2) Assist agricultural and forest landowners and operators with matching payments to support the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation costs of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility.

        (b) A participant must implement and adhere to a conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan prepared in accordance with BCAP guidelines, as established and determined by CCC. A conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan for contract acreage must be implemented by a participant and must be approved by the conservation district in which the lands are located, or, in the case of Federal lands, the appropriate approval authority of jurisdiction. If the conservation district declines to review the conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan, the provider of technical assistance may take such further action as is needed to account for lack of such review.

        (c) Agricultural and forest landowners and operators must comply with any applicable existing conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan and all other applicable laws, regulations, or Executive Orders for any removal of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility to receive matching payments.

        (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, a participant may receive, in addition to any payments under this part, financial assistance, rental or easement payments, tax benefits, or other payments from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in BCAP, without any commensurate reduction in BCAP payments.

#### § § 1450.4

        (a)(1) If a participant fails to carry out the terms and conditions of a BCAP contract, CCC may terminate the BCAP contract.

        (2) If the BCAP contract is terminated by CCC in accordance with this paragraph:

        (i) The participant will forfeit all rights to further payments under the contract and must refund all payments previously received, plus interest; and

        (ii) The participant must pay liquidated damages to CCC in an amount as specified in the contract.

        (b) CCC may reduce a demand for a refund under this section to the extent CCC determines that such relief would be appropriate and would not deter the accomplishment of the purposes of BCAP.

        § 1450.5   Performance based on advice or action of USDA.

#### § § 1450.5

        (a) The provisions of § 718.303 of this title relating to performance based on the action or advice of an authorized representative of USDA apply to this part, and may be considered as a basis to provide relief to persons subject to sanctions under this part to the extent that relief is otherwise permitted by this part.

#### § § 1450.7

        (a) Payments received under this part will be divided as specified in the applicable contract. CCC may refuse to enter into a contract when there is a disagreement among persons or legal entities seeking enrollment as to a person's or legal entity's eligibility to participate in the contract as a tenant or sharecropper, and there is insufficient evidence, as determined by CCC, to indicate whether the person or legal entity seeking participation as a tenant or sharecropper has an interest in the acreage offered for enrollment in the BCAP.

        (b) CCC may remove an operator or tenant from a BCAP contract when:

        (1) The operator or tenant requests in writing to be removed from the BCAP contract;

        (2) The operator or tenant files for bankruptcy and the trustee or debtor in possession fails to affirm the contract, to the extent permitted by applicable bankruptcy laws;

#### § § 1450.10

        (a) If CCC determines that a person or legal entity has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, or any part, of any USDA program, payment otherwise due or paid such person or legal entity during the applicable period may be required to be refunded, with interest calculated from the date of disbursement of the funds by CCC, as determined appropriate by CCC.

        (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person or legal entity of any payments, or obtaining a payment that otherwise would not be payable.

        (c) A new owner or operator or tenant of land subject to this part who succeeds to the contract responsibilities must report in writing to CCC any interest of any kind in the land subject to this part that is retained by a previous participant. Such interest may include a present, future, or conditional interest, reversionary interest, or any option, future or present, on such land, and any interest of any lender in such land where the lender has, will, or can legally obtain, a right of occupancy to such land or an interest in the equity in such land other than an interest in the appreciation in the value of such land occurring after the loan was made. Failure to fully disclose such interest will be considered a scheme or device under this section.

        § 1450.212   Establishment payments.

#### § § 1450.212

        (a) Establishment payments will be made available upon a determination by CCC that an eligible practice, or an identifiable portion of a practice, has been established in compliance with the appropriate standards and specifications.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided for in this part, such payments will be made only for the cost-effective establishment or installation of an eligible practice, as determined by CCC.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such payments will not be made to the same owner or operator on the same acreage for any eligible practices that have been previously established, or for which such owner or operator has received establishment assistance from any Federal agency.

        (d) Establishment payments may be authorized for the replacement or restoration of practices on land for which assistance has been previously allowed under BCAP, only if the failure of the original practice was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant, as determined by CCC.

        (e) In addition, CCC may make partial payments when the participant completes identifiable components of the contract. CCC may make supplemental establishment payments, if necessary.

For socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, as defined in part 718 of this title, establishment payments may not exceed $750 per acre.

        (b) The average cost of performing a practice will be determined by CCC based on recommendations from the State Technical Committee. Such cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State or county, as determined by CCC. The average cost as determined by CCC will be used for payment purposes, if it is less than the actual cost for an individual participant.

        (c) Except as otherwise provided for in this part, a participant may receive, in addition to any payment under this part, establishment assistance, rental payments, or tax benefits from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in BCAP without a commensurate reduction in BCAP establishment payments.

        (c) The annual payment will be divided among the participants on a single contract as agreed to in such contract, as determined by CCC.

        (d) A participant that has an established eligible crop and is therefore not eligible for establishment payments under § 1450.212 may be eligible for annual payments under the provisions of this section.

        (e) In the case of a contract succession, annual payments will be divided between the predecessor and the successor participants as agreed to among the participants and approved by CCC. If there is no agreement among the participants, annual payments will be divided in such manner deemed appropriate by the Deputy Administrator and such distribution may be prorated based on the actual days of ownership of the property by each party.

        (f) Annual payments will be reduced, as determined by CCC:

        (1) By a percentage of the sum of the sale price and payments under subpart B of this part for the crop collected or harvested from the contract acreage as follows:

        (i) By 1 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to cellulosic biofuels as defined by 40 CFR 80.1401;

        (ii) By 10 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to advanced biofuels;

        (iii) By 25 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to heat, power, or biobased products;

        (iv) By 100 percent if the eligible crop is used for a purpose other than conversion to heat, power, biobased products, or advanced biofuels;

        (2) If the producer violates a term of the contract; or

        (3) In other circumstances deemed necessary or appropriate to carry out BCAP.

        § 1450.215   Transfer of land.

#### § § 1450.215

        (a)(1) If a new owner or operator purchases or obtains the right and interest in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a BCAP contract, such new owner or operator, upon the approval of CCC, may become a participant to a new BCAP contract with CCC for the transferred land.

        (2) For the transferred land, if the new owner or operator becomes a successor to the existing BCAP contract, the new owner or operator will assume all obligations of the BCAP contract of the previous participant.

        (3) If the new owner or operator is approved as a successor to a BCAP contract with CCC, then, except as otherwise determined by the Deputy Administrator:

        (i) Establishment payments will be made to the past or present participant who established the practice; and

        (ii) Annual payments to be paid during the fiscal year when the land was transferred will be divided between the new participant and the previous participant in the manner specified in § 1450.214(c).

        (b) If a participant transfers all or part of the right and interest in, or right to occupancy of, land subject to a BCAP contract and the new owner or operator does not become a successor to such contract within 60 days of such transfer, or such other time as CCC determines to be appropriate, such contract will be terminated with respect to the affected portion of such land, and the original participant:

        (1) Forfeits all rights to any future payments for that acreage;

        (2) Must refund all previous payments received under the contract by the participant or prior participants, plus interest, except as otherwise specified by CCC. The provisions of § 1450.211(g) will apply.

        (c) Federal agencies acquiring property, by foreclosure or otherwise, that contains BCAP contract acreage cannot be a party to the BCAP contract by succession. However, through an addendum to the BCAP contract, if the current operator of the property is one of the BCAP contract participants, the BCAP contract may remain in effect and, as permitted by CCC, such operator may continue to receive payments under such contract if CCC determines that such allowance is in the public interest and:

        (1) The property is maintained in accordance with the terms of the contract;

        (2) Such operator continues to be the operator of the property; and

        (3) Ownership of the property remains with such Federal agency.

      § 1455.20   Criteria for grant selection.

#### § § 1455.20

      (a) Incomplete or non-responsive applications will not be evaluated. Applicants may revise their applications and re-submit them prior to the published deadline if there is sufficient time to do so.

      (b) After all applications have been evaluated using the evaluation criteria and scored in accordance with the point allocation specified in the announcement for program funding, a list of all applications in ranked order, together with funding level recommendations, will be submitted to the Chief or designee.

      (c) Unless supplemented in a APF, applications for grants for VPA-HIP will be evaluated using the criteria listed in this section. The distribution of points to be awarded per criterion will be identified in the APF.

      (1)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether and to what extent the project's anticipated outcomes promote improvement of public access for wildlife-dependent recreation and intended environmental benefits.

      (2)  The application will be evaluated on the extent and quality to which the applicant demonstrates a reasonable approach to the project, sufficient resources to complete the project, and a capability to complete the project in a timely manner.

      (3)  The application will be evaluated based on the applicant's plan for encouraging the participation of owners and operators of privately-held farm, ranch, and forest land, and for engaging the public users. Additionally, the extent to which the applicant has identified and established relationships with the partners necessary to achieve the project's goals will be evaluated.

      (4)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether the applicant demonstrates expertise in providing technical assistance with respect to establishing and maintaining appropriate wildlife habitat on public access land.

      (5)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether the project proposes to provide incentives to increase public hunting and other recreational access on land enrolled under a USDA conservation program, including lands enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Easement component of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, part 1468, subpart C of this chapter.

      (6)  The application will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the support letters provided by other organizations involved with the project demonstrate specific and quantified commitments to the project. Applications that demonstrate additional resources will receive more points, all else being equal, than those that do not.

      (7)  The application will be evaluated to determine how the project proposes to make available to the public the location of the land enrolled.

      (8)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether the applicant has included outcome-based performance measures.

      (9)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether the grant applicant has a track record of administering the project or, in the absence of a track record, the capacity to administer the project. Applicants that have demonstrated capable financial systems and audit controls, personnel and program administration performance measures, and clear rules of governance will receive more points than those not evidencing this capacity.

      (10)  The application will be evaluated to determine whether the applicant has a track record in implementing public access or similar programs or, in the absence of an actual track record, the capacity to implement a public access program. The applicant's potential for delivering an effective public access program and the expected effects of that program will also be assessed.

      (11)  The work plan will be reviewed for detailed actions and an accompanying timetable for implementing the components of the application. Clear, logical, realistic, and efficient plans will result in a higher score.

        § 1463.4   National assessment.

#### § § 1463.4

        Annually, CCC will make a determination of a national assessment in as far in advance of when the first assessment is due as CCC determines to be practicable.

        § 1463.5   Division of national assessment among classes of tobacco.

#### § § 1463.5

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the national assessment will be divided by CCC among each class of tobacco based upon CCC's determination of each class's share of the excise taxes paid using for all years the tax rates that applied in fiscal year 2005.

        § 1463.6   Determination of persons liable for payment of assessments.

#### § § 1463.6

        (a) All domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are required to pay to CCC their proportionate share of a calendar year's national assessment. Such entities are those that import or manufacture tobacco products in a calendar year and are required to report to the United States Department of the Treasury or to the Department of Homeland Security the removal of tobacco products into domestic commerce under the Revenue Code or are required to pay taxes under chapter 52 of such code.

        (b)(1) Such entities must provide to CCC's point of contact:

        (i) Entity name; mailing address of the entity's principal place of business; an office or individual that CCC may contact for further information; an e-mail address and postal address at which they wish to receive notifications required by the Act to be made to them by CCC; and

        (ii) On a monthly basis for each class of tobacco, the total amount of tobacco products, summarized by employer identification number or such other method as may be prescribed by CCC, that are required to be reported to the United States Department of the Treasury or to the Department of Homeland Security in each month beginning October 1, 2004, and ending September 30, 2014.

        (2) The information required to be submitted to CCC under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be submitted by:

        (i) With respect to fiscal year 2005 activities occurring prior to February 10, 2005, by February 25, 2005; and

        (ii) With respect to all other activities, on the same date the information was required to be submitted to the United States Department of the Treasury or to the Department of Homeland Security.

        § 1463.7   Division of class assessment to individual entities.

#### § § 1463.7

        (a) In order to determine the assessment owed by an entity, that portion of the national assessment assigned to each class of tobacco will be further divided at the entity level. The amount of the assessment for each class of tobacco to be paid by each domestic manufacturer and importer of tobacco products will be determined by multiplying:

        (1) With respect to each class of tobacco, the adjusted market share of such manufacturer or importer; by

        (2) The total amount of the assessment for that class of tobacco for the calendar year quarter.

        (b) For purposes of determining the volume of domestic sales of each class of tobacco products and for each entity, such sales shall be based upon the reports filed by domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco with the Department of Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security and shall correspond to the quantity of the tobacco product that is removed into domestic commerce by each such entity:

        (1) For cigarettes and cigars, on the number of cigarettes and cigars reported on such reports;

        (2) For all other classes of tobacco, on the number of pounds of those products.

        (c) In determining the adjusted market share of each manufacturer or importer of a class of tobacco products, except for cigars, CCC will determine to the fourth decimal place an entity's share of excise taxes paid of that class of tobacco product during the immediately prior calendar year quarter. With respect to cigars, CCC will determine the adjusted market share for each manufacturer or importer of a class of tobacco products based on the number of such products removed into domestic commerce.

        (d) The amount of a quarterly assessment owed by a domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products that must be remitted to CCC by the end of a calendar year quarter is based upon the application of the manufacturer's or importer's adjusted market share to the amount of the national assessment that has been allocated to one of the six specified tobacco product sectors under § 1463.5. As provided in § 1463.3, this adjusted market share is determined by the actions of such manufacturer or importer in a prior calendar year quarter. Accordingly, this amount must be remitted to CCC whether or not the manufacturer or importer is engaged in the removal of tobacco or tobacco products into commerce in the calendar year quarter in which it receives notification of the amount of assessment owed to CCC.

        § 1463.8   Notification of assessments.

#### § § 1463.8

        (a) Once CCC has determined a national assessment, CCC will collect that amount on a quarterly basis from all domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco products subject to § 1463.5.

        (b) 30 calendar days prior to the end of each calendar year quarter domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco products will receive notification of:

        (1) The national assessment;

        (2) The percentage of the national assessment that has been allocated to each class of tobacco product and the total amount of assessments due from each such class;

        (3) Any adjustments that have been from the prior fiscal year with respect to the allocation of the gross domestic volume determined for use in a fiscal year among the classes of tobacco products;

        (4) An adjustment in the national assessment if CCC determines that the assessments imposed will result in insufficient funds due to changes in the amount of expenditures that CCC has determined will be made in a calendar year;

        (5) The volume of gross sales of each class of tobacco that CCC has allocated to the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products for the purposes of determining such entity's adjusted market share. The volume of gross sales of each class of tobacco allocated to such an entity shall correspond to the quantity of the tobacco product that is removed into domestic commerce by each such entity;

        (6) The total volume of gross sales of each class of tobacco that CCC has allocated to a class of tobacco, within the gross domestic volume determined for use in a fiscal year, that was used for the purpose of determining a tobacco manufacturer's or tobacco importer's adjusted market share. The total volume of gross sales of each such class of tobacco shall correspond to the total quantity of the tobacco product that is removed into domestic commerce.

        (7) For that quarter, the adjusted market share of the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products;

        (8) Beginning with the 2nd quarter of 2008, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the applied market share for that quarter of each other manufacturer and importer, for the applicable class of tobacco product of those manufacturers and importers that have provided such information to CCC in accordance with the provisions of § 1463.6, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, Farm Service Agency.

        (9) The manner in which assessments are to be remitted to CCC; and

        (10) Identification of those Department of the Treasury and Department of Homeland Security forms filed by the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products that are used to calculate assessments.

        § 1463.9   Payment of assessments.

#### § § 1463.9

        (a) Assessments under this subpart are imposed for the expenditures CCC has determined it will incur in the 2005 through 2014 calendar years. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, payment of such assessments are due to CCC no later than the end of each calendar year quarter. If prior to 30 calendar days before the end of a calendar year quarter CCC has not notified an entity of the amount that is required to be remitted in that quarter, no interest will be assessed by CCC under paragraph (d) of this section until 30 calendar days have elapsed from the date CCC provided notification of the amount owed.

        (b) Payments due under this subpart must be submitted to CCC by electronic fund transfer unless prior written approval has been obtained from CCC.

        (c) The final two calendar year quarterly payments due to CCC under this part shall be due to CCC on September 30, 2014.

        (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if CCC has not received payment of assessments determined to be owed at the end of a calendar year quarter, CCC will assess interest on such unpaid amount beginning on the first day of the calendar year quarter immediately following the end of such prior quarter. Such interest will be at the rate CCC assesses on delinquent debts in accordance with part 1403 of this title.

        (e) With respect to funds placed in escrow that are refunded to the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products due to the resolution of an appeal, interest will be paid on such amount from the date of receipt by CCC until the date of the refund. Such interest rate will be at the rate charged by the U.S. Treasury for CCC's borrowing that is in effect on the date of receipt by CCC of such funds.

        § 1463.10   Civil penalties and criminal penalties.

#### § § 1463.10

        (a) Any person who knowingly fails to provide information required to be filed under this subpart, or provides false information under this subpart, may be subject to the penalties prescribed in 15 U.S.C. 714m, 18 U.S.C. 1003, and such other civil and criminal statutes as the United States determines to be appropriate.

        (b) In addition to an action that may be taken under paragraph (a) of this section, with respect to any person who knowingly fails to provide information required to be filed under this subpart, or that provides false information under this subpart, a person may be subject to assessment of a civil penalty by CCC. Such civil penalty will be imposed by CCC taking into account the severity of the action; whether the action is of a repetitive nature; and the disruption the action has caused with respect to other parties subject to this subpart. Any such civil penalty will not exceed two percent of the value of the kind of tobacco products manufactured or imported by such entity in the fiscal year in which the violation occurred.

        § 1463.11   Appeals and judicial review.

#### § § 1463.11

        (a) An entity may appeal any adverse determination made under this subpart, including with respect to the amount of the assessment, by submitting a written statement that sets forth the basis of the dispute to Darlene Soto, Tobacco Transition Assessment Program Manager, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Room 3722, Mail Stop 0515, Washington DC 20250-0514, within 30 business days of the date of receipt of the notification by CCC of its determination.

        (b) The Executive Vice President shall assign a person to act as the hearing officer on behalf of CCC. The duty of the hearing officer will be to develop an administrative record that will provide the Executive Vice President, or a designee, with sufficient information to render a final determination on the matter in dispute. The hearing to be conducted by the hearing officer will be an informal hearing at which the appellant may present oral and written evidence in support of the appellant's position. A copy of the rules of conduct that will be applicable to the proceeding will be provided to the appellant upon receipt of the appeal by CCC.

        (c) For any appeals filed after October 1, 2014, appellants must submit all supporting documentation within 30 calendar days following the date of the initial written appeal to CCC. Any documents received after that time will not be considered by the hearing officer.

        (1) The final date that entities may file an appeal is January 14, 2016.

        (2) If 30 calendar days elapse following receipt by CCC of the final submission of supporting documentation by an appellant with respect to any appeal filed under this section regarding an assessment imposed on a domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products, without a final administrative decision by CCC, then all administrative remedies available to the appellant will be deemed to be exhausted; except, if the 30th calendar day would fall on a weekend day or federal holiday, then the 30th calendar day will be deemed the next business day following such weekend day or federal holiday.

        (d) Any domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products aggrieved by a determination made by CCC under this subpart may seek review of the determination upon the exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided by this part in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or for the district in which such importer or manufacturer has its principal place of business.

        (1) Farm BQL. The 2004 basic quota, multiplied by the BQL adjustment factor 1.071295. ( The factor adjusts the 2004 basic quota to the 2002 basic quota level.)

        (2) Quota holder BQL. The farm BQL multiplied by the quota holder's ownership share in the farm. ( In the case of undivided tract ownership, BQL must be distributed among the tract quota holders by the tract owners.)

        (c) For flue-cured tobacco quota holders the BQL is established according to the following table, except as adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section:

        (1) Farm BQL. The 2004 basic quota, multiplied by the BQL adjustment factor 1.23457. ( The factor adjusts the 2004 basic quota to the 2002 level.)

        (2) Quota holder BQL. The farm BQL multiplied by the quota holder's ownership share in the farm. ( In the case of undivided tract ownership, BQL must be distributed among the tract quota holders by the tract owner.)

        (d) For quota holders of all other kinds of tobacco the BQL is established according to the following table, except as adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section:

        (1) Farm BQL. The basic allotment established for the farm in 2002 multiplied by the county average production yield. The following NASS yields are to be used for any county without production:

        (e)(1) CCC will divide the BQL for the farm between the parties to the agreement as CCC determines to be fair and equitable, taking into consideration the proportionate amounts of cropland sold, if:

        (i) On or before October 22, 2004, the owner of a farm had entered into an agreement for the sale of all or a portion of a farm for which a farm marketing quota was established for the 2004 marketing year; and

        (ii) Such agreement had not been fulfilled or terminated prior to that date; and

        (iii) The parties to the agreement are unable to agree to the disposition of the contract payment to be made with respect to the farm.

        (2) If, on or before October 22, 2004, the owner of a farm had entered into an agreement for the permanent transfer of all or a portion of a tobacco marketing quota and the transfer had not been completed by such date, the owner of the farm to which such quota was to be transferred shall be considered to be the owner of the marketing quota for the purposes of this subpart. The BQL's for the transferring farm and the receiving farm will be adjusted to reflect this transfer.

        (f) Any tobacco marketing quota preserved under part 1410 of this chapter as the result of the enrollment of a farm in the Conservation Reserve Program shall be included in the determination of the BQL of the farm.

        § 1463.106   Base quota levels for eligible tobacco producers.

#### § § 1463.106

        (a) BQL is determined separately, for each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, for each kind of tobacco and for each farm for which a 2002 farm marketing quota had been established under part 723 of this title.

        (b) The BQL for producers of burley tobacco is established as follows:

        (1) The 2002-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2002 effective quota pounds actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer, and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings. The BQL is then multiplied by the producer's share in the 2002 crop to determine the producer's 2002 BQL. The adjustments for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings are made as follows:

        (i) Disaster-leased pounds are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm;

        (ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2003 effective quota.

        (iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.12486 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.

        (2) The 2003-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2003 effective quota pounds actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings, as follows:

        (i) Disaster leases are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of receiving farm.

        (ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2004 effective quota.

        (iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.071295 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.

        (iv) After these adjustments the BQL is calculated as follows:

        (3) The 2004-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2004 effective quota before disaster lease and transfer is calculated as follows:

        (c) The BQL for producers of flue-cured tobacco is established by year, as follows:

        (1) The 2002-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the effective 2002 quota actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings. The BQL is then multiplied by the producer's share in the 2002 crop to determine the producer's 2002 BQL. Adjustments for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings are calculated as follows:

        (i) Disaster-leased pounds are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm;

        (ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and include only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2003 effective quota.

        (iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.10497 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.

        (2) The 2003-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the 2003 effective quota actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings, as follows:

        (i) Disaster leases are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm.

        (ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were in not part of the farm's 2004 effective quota.

        (iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.23457 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.

        (iv) After these adjustments the BQL is calculated as follows:

        (3) The 2004-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the 2004 effective quota before disaster lease and transfer. The 2004 BQL is calculated as follows:

        (d) The BQL for producers of cigar filler and binder tobacco is established by years, as follows:

        (1) The 2002-crop year BQL for cigar filler and binder tobaccos is calculated as follows:

        (2) The 2003-crop year BQL for cigar filler and binder tobaccos is calculated as follows:

        (3) The 2004-crop year BQL for cigar-filler and binder tobaccos is calculated as follows:

        (e) The BQL's for producers of all kinds of tobacco other than burley, flue-cured and cigar filler and binder, are established by year, as follows.

        (1) The 2002-crop year BQL's for these kinds of tobaccos are calculated as follows:

        (2) The 2003-crop year BQL's for these kinds of tobaccos are calculated as follows:

        (3) The 2004-crop year BQL's for these kinds of tobaccos are calculated as follows:

However, in order for the contract participant to receive the 2005 TTPP payment an application to enter into a TTPP contract must be filed no later than June 17, 2005. CCC may, in its discretion, extend any deadline set forth in this paragraph. However, CCC will make the FY 2005 payment between June and September of 2005, and subsequent payments will be made in January, to the extent practicable, of each FY.

        (c) During each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2014, CCC will make a payment to each eligible producer in an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount due under a contract entered into under this subpart except that in the case an application was filed after June 17, 2005, the applicant will receive only the TTPP payments that have not been made as of the date the contract is approved. However, in order for the contract participant to receive the 2005 TTPP payment, an application to enter into a TTPP contract must be filed no later than June 17, 2005. CCC may, in its discretion, extend any deadline set forth in this paragraph.

#### § § 1463.110

        A person must refund all payments received on all contracts entered into under this subpart, plus interest as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, and pay to CCC liquidated damages as specified in the contract, if CCC determines the person has:

        (a) Erroneously represented any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this subpart;

        (b) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program; or

        (c) Made any fraudulent representation affecting a program determination made in accordance with this subpart.

        § 1463.111   Offsets and assignments.

#### § § 1463.111

        (a) TTPP payments made to any person under this subpart shall be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the tobacco quota, tobacco marketing allotment, or the farm for which a tobacco quota had been established under part 723 of this title by any creditor or any other person.

        (b) The provisions of part 1404 of this title shall not apply to this part.

        (c) A quota holder or tobacco producer who is eligible to receive a payment under this part may assign a payment, or a portion thereof, to be made under this part to another person using the correct CCC form. Such an assignment will become effective upon approval by CCC. In order to provide for the orderly issuance of payments under this part, CCC may limit, in its sole discretion, the number of assignments that may be made with respect to a contract.

        (d)(1) CCC will establish, after consultation with the Department of the Treasury, a discount rate that reflects the value of any remaining payments due under this part if such payments were to be made as a lump sum payment in the current year. Unless there is consideration for such contract in an amount equal to or greater than the discounted value of the payments, subject to the assignment, based on the discount rate established for such payments by CCC, CCC will not approve any assignment other than to:

        (i) A family member; or

        (ii) A party who had purchased a tobacco marketing quota prior to October 22, 2004 and had placed the quota on a farm with the owner's consent prior to that date in the manner that had been prescribed by FSA under part 723 of this chapter.

        (2) The discount rate established by CCC will be determined by adding 200 basis points to the prime lending rate, as determined by CCC. If this sum is a fraction of a number, CCC will round the discount rate to the nearest whole number. Rounding of a half percent will be to the next higher whole number.

        (e) CCC will issue a payment to an assignee only to the extent and amount of payment that CCC would otherwise have issued to the quota holder or producer in the absence of the assignment. In accordance with part 1403 of this title, any claim owed by the assignor to the United States will be deducted from any payment made under this part prior to the issuance of the payment to the assignee.

        (f) CCC will report to the Internal Revenue Service any payment assigned under this section as income earned by the assignor.

#### § § 1463.112

        (a) A quota holder or tobacco producer who is eligible to receive a payment under this part, and for whom a claim has not been established by the United States, may enter into a successor in interest contract with another party using the correct CCC form. Such successor in interest contract will become effective upon approval by CCC, and will not include the 2005 payment. Only one such successor in interest contract may be entered into by a quota holder or tobacco producer with respect to a farm for each kind of tobacco.

        (b) Annually, CCC will establish, after consultation with the Department of the Treasury, a discount rate that reflects the value of any remaining payments due under this part if such payments were to be made as a lump sum payment in the current year. This discount rate will be determined as provided in § 1463.111(d)(2). Unless there is consideration for such contract in an amount equal to or greater than the discounted value of the payments, subject to the successor in interest or contract, based on the discount rate established for such payments by CCC, CCC will not approve any succession in interest contract other than to:

        (1) A family member; or

        (2) A party who had purchased a tobacco marketing quota prior to October 22, 2004 and had placed the quota on a farm with the owner's consent prior to that date in the manner that had been prescribed by FSA under part 723 of this chapter.

        (c) CCC will issue a payment, except the 2005 payment, to a successor party only if such party is otherwise in compliance with all other applicable regulations, which includes for successors to producer contracts only the wetlands and highly erodible land provisions of part 12 of this chapter. In accordance with part 1403 of this title, any claim owed by the successor party to the United States will be deducted from any payment made under this part prior to the issuance of the payment to the successor party.

        (d) CCC will report to the Internal Revenue Service any payment made under a successor in interest contract as income earned by the successor party.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1464.1   Applicability.

#### § § 1464.1

        (a) The purposes of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) are as follows:

        (1) Carry out eligible activities to further the conservation, protection, restoration, and sustainable use of soil, water (including sources of drinking water and ground water), wildlife, agricultural land, and related natural resources on eligible land on a regional or watershed scale;

        (2) Encourage eligible partners to cooperate with producers in—

        (i) Meeting or avoiding the need for national, State, and local natural resource regulatory requirements related to production on eligible lands, including through alignment of partnership projects with other national, State, and local agencies and programs addressing similar natural resource or environmental concerns, and

        (ii) Implementing projects that will result in the adoption, installation, and maintenance of eligible activities that affect multiple agricultural or nonindustrial private forest operations on a local, regional, State, or multistate basis;

        (3) Encourage flexible and streamlined delivery of conservation assistance to producers through partnership agreements; and

        (4) Engage producers and eligible partners in conservation projects to achieve greater conservation outcomes and benefits for producers than would otherwise be achieved.

        (b) Through RCPP, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to implement eligible activities through partnership and supplemental agreements with eligible partners and program contracts with producers.

        (c) RCPP is available in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        (d) Each program contract, partnership agreement, and supplemental agreement is subject to the regulations in place on the date it is executed.

        § 1464.2   Administration.

#### § § 1464.2

        (a) The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) are available to NRCS for carrying out RCPP. Accordingly, each reference to NRCS in this part also refers to CCC funds, facilities, and authorities where applicable.

        (b) No delegation in this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief of NRCS from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part.

        (c) NRCS may use other agency-wide authorities, such as 16 U.S.C. 3842 and 31 U.S.C. 1535, to enter into agreements with other Federal or State agencies, Indian Tribes, conservation districts, units of local government, public or private organizations, and individuals to assist NRCS with implementation of the program in this part.

        (d) To assist in the implementation of the program, the Chief may waive the applicability of the limitation in section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 for participating producers if the Chief determines that the waiver is necessary to fulfill the objectives of the program. Section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 does not apply to eligible partners.

        (e) NRCS will identify in each State a program coordinator who will serve as the primary point of contact for programmatic implementation of RCPP in that State.

        (f) NRCS will establish guidance to assist eligible partners with quantifying conservation benefits of RCPP implementation. Due to the diversity of natural resource issues addressed by an RCPP project and the diversity of conservation activities that a project may undertake, NRCS will work with each partner to develop project-specific outcome approach that will be included in the partnership agreement.

        (i) Justified by the reasons provided by the lead partner;

        (ii) NRCS determines that a modification of the partnership agreement is necessary to comply with applicable law and the partner does not concur with such modification; or

        (iii) The lead partner fails to correct noncompliance with a term of the partnership agreement under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) A termination may be justified by circumstances beyond the lead partners' control that prevents completion of one or more provisions of the partnership agreement, such as a natural disaster or other circumstances in which NRCS may determine that termination is in the public interest.

        (4) If a program agreement is terminated, the lead partner forfeits all rights to any remaining technical or financial assistance under the partnership agreement.

        (d)  Termination of a partnership agreement under this section will—

        (1) Not affect the validity of any program contract that was entered into within the project area encompassed by the partnership agreement; and

        (2) Result in the termination of a supplemental agreement unless NRCS determines that the supplemental agreement would continue to provide necessary program implementation assistance to producers with program contracts or otherwise advance an eligible program activity within the project area.

        (e)  If NRCS terminates a partnership agreement due to noncompliance with its terms or conditions, the lead partner will forfeit any right to future assistance under the partnership agreement and will refund all or part of any payments received directly by the lead partner, plus interest.

        (2) Any technical assistance funds obligated under a supplemental agreement by NRCS will count against the total amount of technical assistance funds that NRCS agreed to provide to the project under the terms of the partnership agreement.

        (d)  Based upon eligibility, evaluation, and selection criteria developed by NRCS, NRCS may provide financial assistance funds under a supplemental agreement if the supplemental agreement is:

        (1) To facilitate the conveyance of an easement to an eligible entity by a producer;

        (2) To implement an eligible activity that is available under 7 CFR part 622, except for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program set forth in 16 U.S.C. 1012;

        (3) Other situations where a program contract requires the integration of a supplemental agreement to facilitate the implementation of an eligible activity, as determined by NRCS.

        (e)  A supplemental agreement will be for a term that is within the term of a partnership agreement unless NRCS determines that the term of the supplemental agreement should extend beyond the term of the partnership agreement to ensure appropriate assistance to participating producers or completion of an eligible activity.

        (f)  NRCS will incorporate in a supplemental agreement:

        (1) The procedures required in the event of a determination that the lead partner or nonlead partner is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the supplemental agreement;

        (2) The consequences for failure to remedy noncompliance, including termination of the supplemental agreement, the requirement to repay any payments received, forfeit any future payments, and the availability of liquidated damages;

        (3) The impacts of termination of the supplemental agreement upon the partnership agreement or any associated program contract;

        (4) The availability, if any, of administrative review of NRCS determinations under § 1464.40; and

        (b) Any costs to a lead or nonlead partner as part of a third-party contract or agreement as described in paragraph (a) of this section may constitute all or part of a partner contribution described in § 1464.22(d)(4) to the extent that such costs directly relate to fulfilling the obligations of a partnership or supplemental agreement, as determined by NRCS.

        (c) NRCS may employ third-party contracts or agreements in order to meet its responsibilities under the terms of an approved partnership agreement, supplemental agreement, or program contract, including but not limited to easement acquisition services, implementation services, or other goods or services NRCS determines are necessary to meet its responsibilities under RCPP.

      Subpart C—Program Contracts

        § 1464.30   Application for program contracts and selecting applications for funding.

#### § § 1464.30

        (a)  In evaluating program contract applications, NRCS may take into consideration the following guidelines:

        (1) Any producer who has eligible land in a project area encompassed by a partnership agreement may submit an application for participation in RCPP.

        (2) To the greatest extent practicable, applications for similar eligible activities may be grouped together in ranking pools for evaluation and ranking purposes.

        (3) Upon execution of a partnership agreement, NRCS will accept producer applications for funding under such agreement throughout the fiscal year and may be evaluated and ranked on a continuous or ranking-period basis.

        (4) NRCS may give priority to applications that are submitted as part of a bundle submitted by a lead partner.

        (5) In selecting RCPP applications, NRCS will develop an evaluation and ranking process to prioritize eligible applications for funding that address the purposes of the project or CCA, including treating the identified project or priority resource concerns, as applicable.

        (b)  (1) NRCS will select eligible applications for funding in order of ranking priority taking into account identified evaluation periods and ranking pools.

        (2) NRCS may decline to select an eligible application if the remaining funding is insufficient to fund that application and NRCS may proceed to the next application in ranked order that can be funded with available funding.

        (3) NRCS, in consultation with the lead partner, may identify and establish in the partnership agreement other limited circumstances that may warrant selection of eligible applications outside of a strictly applied rank order because such application is critical to the success of a project that provides conservation benefits to multiple producers or landowners in a community, watershed, or other geographic area.

        (c)  Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, NRCS or the lead partner will make available to the public sign-up information, including the identification of program and priority resource concerns, a listing of eligible activities, payment rates for certain eligible activities, State supplemental guidance, and contact information for the RCPP State coordinators available to assist partners and applicants with the program.

        (d)  (1) NRCS will identify the designated CCAs and publish priority resource concerns for a CCA project.

        (2) NRCS will select eligible applications for program contracts within CCAs that address one or more priority resource concerns for which the CCA is designated.

        (3) NRCS will identify the priority resource concerns and associated ranking criteria in any announcement under § 1464.20.

        (4) Lands outside of a CCA are not eligible for applications in the CCA, even where conservation efforts on such land may influence resource concerns within the CCA.

        (5) Incorporate all provisions as required by statute or regulation, including requirements that the participant will:

        (i) Not conduct any action that would defeat the program's purposes;

        (ii) Refund any program payments received with interest, and forfeit any future payments under the program, on the violation of a term or condition of the program contract, consistent with the provisions of § 1464.36; and

        (iii) Supply information if required by NRCS to determine compliance with program requirements; and

        (6) Specify any other provision determined necessary or appropriate by NRCS to ensure the program purpose is met.

        (c)  To be eligible to enter into a program contract or receive a payment, an applicant or participant must—

        (1) Provide a tax identification number; however, where applicable, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment;

        (2) Indicate, where applicable, the percent interest share in a payment that is consistent with operation or ownership shares;

        (3) Comply with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions found at part 12 of this title at the time of application and throughout the contract term; and

        (4) Be eligible for payments in accordance with part 1400 of this chapter, average adjusted gross income limitation, including any waiver of these requirements, prior to program contract approval.

        (d)  (1) Except as otherwise indicated in this paragraph, any payments received by a participant from a State, private entity, or person for the implementation of one or more eligible activities on eligible land will be in addition to the payments provided to the participant under this part.

        (2) NRCS will not issue financial assistance to a participant through a program contract for eligible activities on eligible land if the participant receives payments or other benefits for the same or similar eligible activity on the same land under any other conservation program administered by USDA.

        (3) NRCS will not provide technical or financial assistance to a participant for more than one eligible activity to achieve the same resource benefit on the same land during the same time period.

        § 1464.32   Modifications and transfers of land.

#### § § 1464.32

        (a)  NRCS may modify a program contract, if:

        (1) The parties agree to the modification, and

        (2) NRCS determines the modified program contract continues to meet the purposes of the program.

        (b)  NRCS may terminate an entire program contract if, within the time specified in the program contract, the participant does not provide NRCS with written notice regarding any voluntary or involuntary loss of effective control of any acreage under the program contract, which includes changes in the participant's ownership structure or corporate form.

        (c)  NRCS may approve a transfer of a program contract if:

        (1) NRCS has documented notice from the current participant that identifies the new producer who will take control of the acreage, as required in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (2) The current participant transfers rights and responsibilities to the new producer;

        (3) The new producer meets program eligibility requirements within a reasonable time frame, as determined by NRCS, and agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities from the current participant for the acreage under the program contract; and

        (4) NRCS determines that the purposes of the program will continue to be met despite the current participant's losing effective control of all or a portion of the land under contract.

        (d)  (1) Until NRCS approves the transfer of program contract rights, the transferee is not a participant in the program and may not receive payment for eligible activities implemented prior to NRCS approval of the program contract transfer.

        (2) For program contract payment purposes, NRCS will consider the transferor to be the participant to whom payments may be made for eligible activities implemented when NRCS approval of the program contract transfer is pending.

        (e)  NRCS may not approve a program contract transfer and may terminate the program contract in its entirety if NRCS determines that the loss of effective control of the land was voluntary, the participant's written notification of loss of effective control was not provided to NRCS within the specified timeframe, the new producer is not eligible or willing to assume responsibilities under the contract, or the purposes of the program cannot be met.

        (f)  Once an easement deed has been acquired, an easement will run with the land and bind all successors and assigns. Subordination, modification, exchange, or termination of an easement acquired under this part will be consistent with the policies and procedures under 7 CFR part 1468.

        (g)  In the event an eligible activity fails through no fault of the participant, NRCS may issue payments to reestablish the eligible activity, subject to such limitations that NRCS may establish.

        § 1464.33   Violations and remedies.

#### § § 1464.33

        (a)  In the event of a violation of the program contract terms, NRCS will provide the participant written notice as specified in the program contract, and, where appropriate, a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation in accordance with the terms of the program contract.

        (b)  If the participant fails to correct the violation of a term of the program contract in the timeframe specified by NRCS, NRCS may terminate the program contract or require modification as a condition to keep the program contract in effect.

        (c)  If NRCS terminates a program contract due to a violation of its terms or conditions, the participant will forfeit any right to future assistance under the program contract and will refund all or part of any payments received by the participant, plus interest.

        (d)  (1) NRCS may include terms in a program contract that allow for the assessment of liquidated damages in the event of a violation.

        (2) The amount of any liquidated damages will be set at an amount reasonably calculated to reimburse NRCS for its foreseeable losses in the event of a violation by the participant and will not be punitive in nature.

        (3) NRCS will enforce a liquidated damage provision if the Chief determines doing so is in the best interests of RCPP.

        (e)  (1) NRCS may allow a participant in a program contract terminated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the program contract, or in cases of hardship, where NRCS determines that forces beyond the participant's control prevented compliance with the program contract.

        (2) The condition that is the basis for the participant's inability to comply with the program contract must not have existed at the time the program contract was executed by the participant.

        (3) If a participant believes that such a hardship condition exists, the participant may submit a written request to NRCS for relief pursuant to this paragraph and any such request will contain documentation sufficient for NRCS to determine that this hardship condition exists.

        (f)  In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, NRCS may, as identified in the program contract, terminate the contract, make any payments due under this part pursuant to guidance under applicable provisions of parts 707 and 1400 of this title (including payment to successor(s)), or take any further action that the Chief determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

        (g)  NRCS reserves the right to correct any and all errors in entering data or the results of computations in a program contract. If a participant does not agree to such corrections, NRCS will terminate the program contract.

      Subpart D—General Administration

        § 1464.40   Appeals.

#### § § 1464.40

        (a)  A participant may obtain administrative review of an adverse decision under RCPP in accordance with parts 11 and 614 of this title. Any and all determination in matters of general applicability, such as payment rates, the designation of identified program or priority resource concerns, and eligible activities are not subject to appeal.

        (b)

        (1) A lead partner or nonlead partner may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility as a partner under the program or eligibility for financial assistance payments under an agreement that obligated financial assistance funds utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR parts 11 and 614.

        (2) NRCS provision of technical assistance funds under a partnership agreement or supplemental agreement are not subject to administrative review as the provision of such funds are to assist NRCS with its implementation of the program consistent with 16 U.S.C. 3842 and are not program payments or benefits to a lead partner or nonlead partner.

        § 1464.41   Compliance with regulatory measures.

#### § § 1464.41

        Participants who implement eligible activities will be responsible for obtaining the authorities, rights, easements, permits, or other approvals necessary for their implementation consistent with applicable statutes and regulations. Participants will be responsible for compliance with all laws and for all effects or actions resulting from the participant's performance under the contract.

        § 1464.42   Access to agricultural operation or tract.

#### § § 1464.42

        Any authorized NRCS representative will have the right to enter an agricultural operation or tract of land for the purposes of determining eligibility, conducting ranking and due diligence activities, and for ascertaining the accuracy of any representations related to agreement or contract performance. Access will include the right to provide technical assistance, determine eligibility, conduct ranking and onsite inspections prior to execution of an agreement or contract, inspect any actions undertaken under the agreement or contract, and collect information necessary to evaluate agreement or contract performance, as specified in the agreement or contract. The NRCS representative will attempt to contact the applicant or participant prior to exercising this provision.

        § 1464.43   Equitable relief.

#### § § 1464.43

        (a) If a participant relied upon the advice or action of NRCS and did not know, or have reason to know, that the action or advice was improper or erroneous, the participant may be eligible for equitable relief under 7 CFR part 635; however, the financial or technical liability for any action by a participant that was taken based on the advice of a TSP will remain with the TSP and will not be assumed by NRCS.

        (b) If a participant has been found in violation of a program requirement through failure to comply fully with that requirement, the participant may be eligible for equitable relief under 7 CFR part 635.

        § 1464.44   Offsets and assignments.

#### § § 1464.44

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment or portion thereof to any person, legal entity, joint operation, or Indian Tribe will be made without regard to questions of title to the payment under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations governing offsets and withholdings found at part 1403 of this chapter will apply to contract payments.

        (b) Any person, legal entity, Indian Tribe, eligible entity, or other party entitled to any cash payment under this program may assign the right to receive such cash payments, in whole or in part.

        § 1464.45   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1464.45

        (a) A person, legal entity, joint operation, or Indian Tribe that is determined to have erroneously represented any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part will not be entitled to payments under RCPP and must refund to NRCS all RCPP payments, plus interest, determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.

        (b) A participant will lose all interest in all contracts or agreements with NRCS and will refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, received by such participant with respect to all contracts and agreements if it is determined that the participant has knowingly:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation to NRCS;

        (3) Adopted any scheme or device for the purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which such person would otherwise be entitled under the program; or

        (4) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

        (c) If NRCS determines that a participant has violated the terms of a program contract, a lead partner has violated the terms of a partnership agreement, or a lead partner or nonlead partner has violated the terms of a supplemental agreement, NRCS may determine that the severity of the violation renders the participant, lead partner, or nonlead partner, respectively, ineligible for future NRCS conservation program consideration in accordance with applicable suspension and debarment regulations.

        § 1464.46   Environmental credits for conservation improvements.

#### § § 1464.46

        NRCS recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing eligible activities funded through RCPP, and a participant may obtain environmental credits as a result of implementing additional eligible activities through an environmental service market if one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with the purposes of a program contract or supplemental agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest on these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements for RCPP-funded eligible activities are met. Where the non-RCPP funded additional eligible activities may impact the land under a program contract or supplemental agreement, producers and participants are highly encouraged to request an O&M compatibility determination from NRCS prior to entering into any environmental credit agreements.

If a participant continues in violation, the State Conservationist may terminate the AMA contract.

        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of this section, a contract termination will be effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has submitted false information or filed a false claim, or engaged in any act, scheme, or device for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under the provisions of § 1465.35, or in a case in which the actions of the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.

        (c) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit all rights to future payments under the contract and refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest. Participants violating AMA contracts may be determined ineligible for future NRCS-administered conservation program funding.

        (1) The State Conservationist may require only a partial refund of the payments received if the State Conservationist determines that a previously installed conservation practice can function independently and is not affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation practices that would have been installed under the contract.

        (2) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, or the participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual payments have been made, the participant will forfeit all rights for further payments under the contract and will pay such liquidated damages as prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist will have the option to waive the liquidated damages depending upon the circumstances of the case.

        (i) When making all contract termination decisions, NRCS may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract or the existence of hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance with the contract. If the participant claims hardship, that claim must be well documented and cannot have existed when the applicant applied for participation in the program.

        (ii) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if NRCS agrees based on NRCS' determination that termination is in the public interest.

        (iii) In carrying out NRCS' role in this section, NRCS may consult with the local conservation district.

However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that operation and maintenance requirements for AMA-funded improvements are met, consistent with § 1465.21 and § 1465.22. Where activities may impact the land under an AMA contract, participants are highly encouraged to request an operation and maintenance compatibility determination prior to entering into any credit agreements. The AMA conservation program contract may be modified in accordance with policies outlined in § 1465.24 provided the modifications meet AMA purposes and are in compliance with this part.

        (a)  (1) The purposes of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) are to promote agricultural production, forest management, and environmental quality as compatible goals, and to optimize environmental benefits.

        (2) Through EQIP, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, including nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners and Indian Tribes, to help implement conservation practices that address resource concerns related to organic production; soil, water, and air quality; wildlife habitat; nutrient management associated with crops and livestock; pest management; ground and surface water conservation; irrigation management; drought resiliency measures; adapting to and mitigating against increasing weather volatility; energy conservation; and related resource concerns.

        (3) EQIP's financial and technical assistance helps:

        (i) Producers comply with environmental regulations and enhance agricultural and forested lands in a cost-effective and environmentally beneficial manner; and

        (ii) To the maximum extent practicable, avoid the need for resource and regulatory programs.

        (4) The purposes of EQIP are achieved by planning and implementing conservation practices on eligible land to address identified, new, or expected resource concerns, including such resource concerns related to lands enrolled under a Conservation Reserve Program contract that are transitioning into production as specified in 16 U.S.C. 3835(f).

        (b)  EQIP is available in any of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        (c)  Each contract enrolled into EQIP, is subject to the regulations in effect on the date it is enrolled.

        (d) NRCS may periodically inspect the conservation practice during the contract duration as specified in the O&M agreement to ensure that O&M requirements are being carried out and that the conservation practice is fulfilling its intended objectives.

        (e) If NRCS finds during the contract that a participant is not operating and maintaining practices in an appropriate manner, NRCS may terminate the contract and request a refund of payments made for that conservation practice under the contract.

        § 1466.23   Payment rates.

#### § § 1466.23

        (a)  NRCS will develop a list of conservation practices eligible for payment under the program, which considers:

        (1) The conservation practice cost-effectiveness, implementation efficiency, and innovation;

        (2) The degree and effectiveness in treating priority resource concerns;

        (3) The number of resource concerns the practice addresses;

        (4) The longevity of the practice's conservation benefit;

        (5) The conservation practice's ability to assist producers in meeting regulatory requirements; and

        (6) Other pertinent local considerations.

        (b)  The Chief will determine the process and methodology used for development, review, and approval of payment schedules to support accurate and cost-effective delivery of program benefits, including determination of estimated incurred costs and income foregone associated with implementation of all financially-supported conservation practices or activities.

        (1) Payment to a participant for performing a practice may not exceed, as determined by NRCS, the maximum payment percentages in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:

        (i) Seventy-five percent of the estimated costs incurred by implementing the conservation practice,

        (ii) One hundred percent of the estimated income foregone, or

        (iii) Both conditions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, where a producer incurs costs in implementing a conservation practice and foregoes income related to that practice implementation.

        (2) In determining the amount and rate of estimated income foregone, NRCS may assign higher significance to conservation practices which promote—

        (i) Soil health;

        (ii) Water quality and quantity improvement;

        (iii) Nutrient management;

        (iv) Pest management;

        (v) Air quality improvement;

        (vi) Wildlife habitat development, including pollinator habitat;

        (vii) Invasive species management; or

        (viii) Other natural resource concerns of regional or national significance, as determined by NRCS.

        (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a participant that meets the definition of a historically underserved producer under § 1466.3 may be awarded the applicable payment rate and an additional rate that is not less than 25 percent above the applicable rate, provided this increase does not exceed 90 percent of the estimated costs incurred for implementing the conservation practice.

        (4) NRCS shall reduce the payments to a participant through EQIP proportionately below the contracted payment rate established by the Chief, so that the total combined payments for a conservation practice from EQIP and other USDA sources does not exceed 100 percent of the estimated costs incurred for implementing or performing the conservation practice.

        (5) When NRCS enters into a formal agreement with partners who provide financial support to help implement program initiatives, the Chief shall adjust NRCS program payment percentages to provide practice payment rates to an amount such that the total financial assistance to the participant from NRCS and the partner does not exceed the amount needed to encourage voluntary adoption of the practice. The formal agreement must be approved by NRCS prior to announcement of the program initiative and adjusted payment rates.

        (6) NRCS may provide payments for conservation practices on some or all of the operations of a participant related to organic production and the transition to organic production. Payments may not be provided for any costs associated with organic certification, enterprise costs associated with transition to organic production, or for practices or activities that are eligible for financial assistance under the National Organic Program (7 U.S.C. 6523).

        (c)  (1) NRCS, with input from the State Technical Committee, may designate not more than 10 practices to be eligible for increased payments under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, on the condition that the practice, as determined by NRCS—

        (i) Addresses specific causes of impairment relating to excessive nutrients in ground or surface water;

        (ii) Addresses the conservation of water, to advance drought mitigation and declining aquifers;

        (iii) Meets other environmental priorities and other priority resource concerns identified in habitat or other area restoration plans; or

        (iv) Is geographically targeted to address a natural resource concern in a specific watershed.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of a practice designated as high priority under paragraph (c)(1) of this section a participant may receive an increased amount provided the payment does not exceed 90 percent of the incurred costs estimated for the conservation practice.

        (d)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of a practice that is a source water protection practice as identified by the Chief, a participant may receive an increased amount provided the payment does not exceed 90 percent of the incurred costs estimated for the practice.

        (4) Contracts with Indian Tribes are not subject to payment or contract limitations, provided that—

        (i) Indian Tribes certify in writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive more than the payment limitation,

        (ii) Certification provided at the time of enrollment covers the entire contract period, and

        (iii) The Tribal entity provides, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations, with the conditions in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section:

        (A) Payment limitations apply to individual Tribal member(s) when applying and subsequently being granted a contract as an individual(s);

        (B) American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment; and

        (C) Any individual Tribal member who is identified utilizing a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax identification number will utilize only that identifier for all contracts to which the individual Tribal member receives a payment directly or indirectly;

        (5) Any cooperative association of producers that markets commodities for producers is not eligible for payment;

        (6) NRCS will confirm eligibility for payments in accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, subpart F, Average Adjusted Gross Income Limitation, prior to contract approval;

        (7) To be eligible for payments for conservation practices related to organic production or the transition to organic production:

        (i) Participants who are USDA certified organic producers will implement conservation practices that are consistent with an approved organic system plan (OSP), and

        (ii) Participants who are transitioning to organic production (including participants who are exempt from certification as defined by the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990) will develop an OSP and implement conservation practices that are consistent with OSP requirements and purposes of the program;

        (8) A participant is not eligible for payments for conservation practices on eligible land if the participant receives payments or other benefits for the same practice to address the same resource concern on the same land under any other conservation program administered by USDA; and

        (9) Before NRCS approves and issues any EQIP payment, the participant must certify that the conservation practice has been completed in accordance with contract requirements, and NRCS or an approved TSP must certify that the practice has been carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS FOTG technical standards.

        (d)  (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, with respect to participants who are historically underserved producers, NRCS may issue advance payments of at least 50 percent and not to exceed 100 percent of the anticipated amount of the costs incurred for the purpose of purchasing materials or services to implement a conservation practice.

        (2) Eligibility for advance payment is contingent upon the requirement that the participant obtain an NRCS-approved practice design prior to approval of the advance payment.

        (3) The participant must expend advanced funds for practice implementation within 90 days from receipt of funds or return the funds to NRCS within a reasonable time as determined by NRCS.

        § 1466.25   Contract modifications and transfers of contract rights.

#### § § 1466.25

        (a) NRCS may modify a contract, if—

        (1) The participant agrees to the modification; and

        (2) NRCS determines the modified contract continues to meet the purposes of the program.

        (b) NRCS may approve a transfer of the contract if—

        (1) NRCS receives written notice that identifies the new producer who will take control of the acreage, as required in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (2) The new producer meets program eligibility requirements within a reasonable time frame, as specified in the EQIP contract;

        (3) The new producer agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities for the acreage under the contract; and

        (4) NRCS determines that the purposes of the program will continue to be met despite the original participant's losing control of all or a portion of the land under contract.

        (c)(1) Until NRCS approves the transfer of contract rights, the transferee is not a participant in the program and may not receive payment for a conservation practice commenced prior to approval of the contract transfer.

        (2) For contract payment purposes, NRCS will consider the transferor to be the participant to whom payments will be made for conservation practices implemented during the pendency of the approval of contract transfer.

        (d) NRCS may terminate the entire contract if, within the time specified in the contract, a participant does not provide NRCS with written notice regarding any voluntary or involuntary loss of control of any acreage under the EQIP contract, which includes changes in a participant's ownership structure or corporate form.

        (e) Unless NRCS receives timely notice of a loss of control and approves a transfer of contract rights, a participant losing control of any acreage will constitute a violation of the EQIP contract and NRCS may terminate the contract and require a participant to refund all or a portion of any financial assistance provided.

        (f) NRCS may not approve a contract transfer and may terminate the contract in its entirety if NRCS determines that the loss of control is voluntary, the new producer is not eligible or willing to assume responsibilities under the contract (including payment rate eligibility), or the purposes of the program cannot be met.

        (g) In the event a conservation practice fails through no fault of the participant, NRCS may issue payments to reestablish the practice, at the rates established in accordance with § 1466.23, provided such payments do not exceed the payment limitation requirements as set forth in § 1466.24.

        (h) In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, NRCS may, as identified in the EQIP contract—

        (1) Terminate the contract;

        (2) Make any payments due under this part pursuant to guidance under applicable provisions of 7 CFR parts 707 and 1400 (including payment to successor(s)); or

        (3) Take any further action that the Chief determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

        § 1466.26   Contract violations and terminations.

#### § § 1466.26

        (a) NRCS may terminate a contract—

        (1) Without the consent of the participant where NRCS determines that the participant violated the contract; or

        (2) With the consent of the participant if NRCS determines that the termination is in the public interest.

        (b)(1) NRCS may allow a participant in a contract terminated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the contract, or in cases of hardship, when forces beyond the participant's control prevented compliance with the contract.

        (2) The condition that is the basis for the participant's inability to comply with the contract must not have existed at the time the contract was executed by the participant.

        (3) If a participant believes that such a hardship condition exists, the participant may submit a request with NRCS for relief pursuant to this paragraph and any such request must contain documentation sufficient for NRCS to make a determination that this hardship condition exists.

        (c)(1) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a contract, O&M agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the contract, NRCS may give the participant a reasonable period of time, as determined by NRCS, to correct the violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto.

        (2) If a participant continues to be in violation after such reasonable time, NRCS may terminate the EQIP contract in accordance with § 1466.26(f).

        (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, a contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by NRCS that the participant—

        (1) Submitted false information or filed a false claim;

        (2) Engaged in any act, scheme, or device for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under the provisions of § 1466.35; or

        (3) Incurred a violation of the contract provisions that cannot be corrected in a timeframe established by NRCS.

        (e) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, the participant forfeits all rights to future payments under the contract, pay liquidated damages, and refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest.

        (1) NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation practice can function independently and is not adversely affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation practices that would have been installed under the contract.

        (2) NRCS may reduce or waive the liquidated damages depending upon the circumstances of the case.

        (3) When terminating a contract, NRCS may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract or the existence of hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance with the contract.

        (4) Any participant whose EQIP contract is terminated under paragraph (d) of this section may be subject to debarment or suspension under 7 CFR part 1407.

        (f) NRCS may terminate a contract that provides payments to a participant for conservation practices related to organic production, if NRCS determines that the participant is not implementing practices according to provisions of the contract agreement or does not meet provisions of this part.

      § 1467.4   Program requirements.

#### § § 1467.4

      (a)  (1) Under the WRP, NRCS may purchase conservation easements from, or enter into 30-year contracts or restoration cost-share agreements with, eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate to restore, protect, or enhance wetlands on eligible private and Tribal lands. The 30-year contract enrollment option is only available to acreage owned by Indian Tribes.

      (2) To participate in WRP, a landowner must agree to the implementation of a WRPO, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of eligible lands. NRCS may provide cost-share assistance through a restoration cost-share agreement or an easement restoration agreement for the conservation practices and activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values. For easement transactions, NRCS may implement such conservation practices and activities through an agreement with the landowner, a contract with a vendor, or a cooperative agreement with a cooperating entity. Specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management actions may be undertaken by the landowner, NRCS, or other designee.

      (b)  (1) Except for areas devoted to windbreaks or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, no more than 25 percent of the total cropland in any county, as determined by the FSA, may be enrolled in the CRP and the WRP, and no more than 10 percent of the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement acquired through the WRP.

      (2) NRCS and FSA shall concur before a waiver of the 25 percent limit of this paragraph can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in the WRP. Such a waiver will only be approved if the waiver will not adversely affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 U.S.C. 3812.

      (c)  To be eligible to enroll in the WRP, a person, legal entity, or Indian Tribe must be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions in 7 CFR part 12. Persons or legal entities must be in compliance with the Adjusted Gross Income Limitation provisions at Subpart G of 7 CFR part 1400, and:

      (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought;

      (2) For easement applications, have been the landowner of such land for the 7-year period prior to the time the land is determined eligible for enrollment unless it is determined by the State Conservationist that:

      (i) The land was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous landowner;

      (ii) The ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law; or

      (iii) The land was acquired under circumstances that give adequate assurances, as determined by NRCS, that such land was not acquired for the purposes of placing it in the program, such as demonstration of status as a beginning farmer or rancher.

      (3) Agree to provide such information to NRCS as the agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes.

      (d) When a parcel of land that has been accepted for enrollment into the WRP is sold or transferred prior to the easement being perfected, the application or option agreement to purchase will be cancelled and acres will be removed from enrollment. If the new landowner wishes to continue enrollment, a new application must be filed so that all eligibility criteria may be examined and documented.

      (e)  (1) Only private land or land owned by Indian Tribes may be considered for enrollment into WRP.

      (2) NRCS shall determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the easement and the cost of the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management.

      (3) Land shall only be considered eligible for enrollment in the WRP if NRCS determines, in consultation with the FWS, that:

      (i) The enrollment of such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;

      (ii) Such land is—

      (A) Farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on the wetlands; or

      (B) Cropland or grassland that was used for agricultural production prior to flooding from the natural overflow of a closed basin lake or pothole, together with the adjacent land, where practicable, that is functionally dependent on the cropland or grassland; and

      (iii) The likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program, taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.

      (4) Land may be considered farmed wetland or converted wetland under paragraph (3)(ii)(A) of this section if such land is identified by NRCS as:

      (i) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland pastures, and lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop wetland functions and values; or

      (ii) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially restored.

      (5) Land under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section may be considered for enrollment into 30-year easements if it meets the criteria under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, it is located in the Prairie Pothole Region as defined under § 1467.3 of this part, and the size of the parcel offered for enrollment is a minimum of 20 contiguous acres. Such land meets the requirement of likelihood of successful restoration only if the soils are hydric and the depth of water is 6.5 feet or less.

      (6) If land offered for enrollment is determined eligible under paragraph (e)(3) and (e)(5) of this section, then NRCS may also enroll land adjacent or contiguous to such eligible land together with the eligible land, if such land maximizes wildlife benefits and:

      (i) Is farmed wetland and adjoining lands enrolled in CRP, with the highest wetland functions and values, and is likely to return to production after it leaves CRP;

      (ii) Is a riparian area along streams or other waterways that links or, after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands which are protected by an easement or other device or circumstance that achieves the same objectives as an easement; or

      (iii) Land adjacent to the eligible land that would contribute significantly to wetland functions and values, such as buffer areas, wetland creations, non-cropped natural wetlands, and restored wetlands, but not more than the State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, determines is necessary for such contribution.

      (7) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of the area for program purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives, as determined by NRCS.

      (f)  Land subject to an existing CRP contract may be enrolled in the WRP only if the land and landowner meet the requirements of this part, and the enrollment is requested by the landowner and agreed to by NRCS. To enroll in WRP, the CRP contract for the property must be terminated or otherwise modified subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by FSA and the landowner.

      (g)  The following land is not eligible for enrollment in the WRP:

      (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commenced after December 23, 1985;

      (2) Land that contains timber stands established under a CRP contract or pastureland established to trees under a CRP contract;

      (3) Lands owned by an agency of the United States, other than held in trust for Indian Tribes;

      (4) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State, or a unit of local government;

      (5) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection of wetland functions and values as would be provided by enrollment in WRP; and

      (6) Lands where implementation of restoration practices would be undermined due to on-site or off-site conditions, such as risk of hazardous substances either on-site or off-site, proposed or existing rights of way, either on-site or off-site, for infrastructure development, or adjacent land uses, such as airports, that would either impede complete restoration or prevent wetland functions and values from being fully restored.

      § 1467.5   Application procedures.

#### § § 1467.5

      (a)  To apply for enrollment, a landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP.

      (b)  By filing an Application for Participation, the landowner consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values, and for other activities, such as the development of the preliminary WRPO, that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to evaluate applications. The landowner is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.

      (c)  In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to accept a lesser payment than is being offered by NRCS.

      § 1467.6   Establishing priority for enrollment of properties in WRP.

#### § § 1467.6

      (a) When evaluating easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement offers from landowners, the NRCS, with advice from the State Technical Committee, may consider:

      (1) The conservation benefits of obtaining an easement, or other interest in the land;

      (2) The cost effectiveness of each easement or other interest in eligible land, so as to maximize the environmental benefits per dollar expended;

      (3) Whether the landowner or another person is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds;

      (4) The extent to which the purposes of the easement program would be achieved on the land;

      (5) The productivity of the land; and

      (6) The on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities.

      (b) To the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, NRCS shall give priority to:

      (1) Obtaining permanent easements over shorter term easements; and

      (2) Acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife, in consultation with FWS.

      (c) NRCS, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, may place higher priority on certain geographic regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve State and regional goals and objectives.

      (d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State Conservationist may, at any time, exclude enrollment of otherwise eligible lands if the participation of the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling or ineligible to participate. The State Conservationist may coordinate with other Federal, State, and nonprofit organizations to encourage the restoration of wetlands on adjacent ineligible lands, especially in priority geographic areas.

      (e)(1) The Chief will conduct an assessment during fiscal year 2008 and each subsequent fiscal year for the purpose of determining the interest and allocations for the Prairie Pothole Region to enroll land determined eligible under § 1467.4(d)(5) of this part into 30-year easements. Annually, the Chief will provide specific instructions for the assessment in writing to the applicable State Conservationists.

      (2) The Chief will make an adjustment to the allocation for an applicable State for a fiscal year, based on the results of the assessment conducted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the State during the previous fiscal year.

      § 1467.7   Enrollment process.

#### § § 1467.7

      (a)  Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program.

      (b)  The notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS or the United States to enroll the proposed project in WRP, nor does it bind the landowner to continue with enrollment in the program. The notice informs the landowner of NRCS' intent to continue the enrollment process on their land unless otherwise notified by the landowner.

      (c) —(1)  For applications requesting enrollment through an easement, an option agreement to purchase will be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the easement area; the easement compensation amount; the easement terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the option agreement to purchase. NRCS will continue with easement acquisition activities after the property has been enrolled.

      (2)  For applications requesting enrollment through the restoration cost-share agreement option, a restoration cost-share agreement shall be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the enrolled area, the agreement terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the restoration cost-share agreement. NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the property has been enrolled.

      (3)  For applications requesting enrollment through the 30-year contract option, a 30-year contract shall be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the contract area, the contract terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the _30-year contract._ NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the property has been enrolled.

      (d)  (1) The enrollment document establishes the terms of enrollment consistent with the terms and conditions of this part, and identifies the:

      (i) Scope of the agreement between NRCS and the landowner;

      (ii) Basis for NRCS to obligate funds; and

      (iii) Nature and method through which NRCS will provide WRP technical and financial assistance to the landowner.

      (2) The option agreement to purchase between NRCS and the landowner under the easement option constitutes the agreement for:

      (i) Granting an easement on the enrolled land as set forth under § 1467.11;

      (ii) Implementing a WRPO which provides for the restoration and protection of the functions and values of wetlands;

      (iii) Recording the easement in accordance with applicable State law; and

      (iv) Ensuring the title to the easement is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed acceptable by NRCS.

      (3) The terms of the easement identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section includes the landowner's agreement to the implementation of a WRPO identified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. In particular, the easement deed identifies that NRCS has the right to enter the easement area to undertake, on a cost-share basis with the landowner or other entity, any activities to restore, protect, manage, maintain, enhance, and monitor the wetland and other natural values of the easement area.

      (4) At the time NRCS enters into an agreement to purchase, NRCS agrees, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, to acquire and provide for restoration of the land enrolled into the program.

      (e)  Prior to execution of the easement deed by the United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability to clear title, sale of the land, risk of hazardous substance contamination, or other reasons. The offer of enrollment to the landowner shall be void if not executed by the landowner within the time specified.

      § 1467.8   Compensation for easements and 30-year contracts.

#### § § 1467.8

      (a)  (1) Compensation for an easement under this part shall be made in cash in such amount as is agreed to and specified in the option agreement to purchase or 30-year contract.

      (2) Payments for non-permanent easements or 30-year contracts shall be not more than 75 percent of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement as determined by the methods listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (3) NRCS shall pay as compensation the lowest of the following:

      (i) The fair market value of the land using the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices, or based on an area-wide market analysis or survey;

      (ii) The geographic area rate cap determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or

      (iii) The landowner offer.

      (4) The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, shall establish one or more geographic area rate caps within a state. The State Conservationist shall submit geographic area rate caps and supporting documentation to the Chief for approval. Each State Conservationist will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include: Soil types, type(s) of crops capable of being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.

      (b)  (1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim to additional compensation based on fair market value.

      (2)(i) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 30 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the option agreement to purchase or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.

      (ii) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at more than $500,000, the Secretary may provide compensation in at least 5, but not more than 30 annual payments. NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the option agreement to purchase, warranty easement deed, or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.

      (c)  For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse participants for their fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as determined by NRCS. The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish maximum payments to reimburse participants for reasonable expenses, if incurred.

      (d)  Subject to applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, a participant may be eligible for a bargain sale tax deduction which is the difference between the fair market value of the easement conveyed to the United States and the easement payment made to the participant. NRCS disclaims any representations concerning the tax implications of any easement or cost-share transaction.

      (e)  If easement payments are calculated on a per acre basis, adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on final determination of acreage.

      § 1467.9   Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program.

#### § § 1467.9

      (a)  (1) The purpose of WREP is to target and leverage resources to address high priority wetlands protection, restoration, and enhancement objectives through agreements with States (including a political subdivision or agency of a State), nongovernmental organizations, and Indian Tribes.

      (2) Funding for WREP agreements will be announced in the

      (i) The announcement will provide details on the priorities for funding, required level of partner matching funds, ranking criteria, level of available funding, and additional criteria as determined by the Chief.

      (ii) The Chief will determine the funding level for WREP on an annual basis. Funds for WREP are derived from funds available for WRP.

      (3) Proposals will be submitted to the State Conservationist of the State in which the majority of the project area resides.

      (i) State Conservationists will evaluate proposals based on the ranking criteria established in the announcement and provide proposals recommended for funding to the Chief.

      (ii) The Chief will evaluate proposals recommended for funding and make final funding selections, in accordance with ranking factors identified in the announcement.

      (4) Selected proposals and associated funding will be provided to the State Conservationist to enter into WREP agreements with the eligible partner to carry out the project.

      (b)  (1) The Chief shall carry out a reserved rights pilot subject to the requirements established in this part.

      (2) Under the reserved rights pilot, a landowner may reserve grazing rights in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract, if the State Conservationist determines that the reservation and use of the grazing rights:

      (i) Is compatible with the land subject to the easement or 30-year contract; and

      (ii) Is consistent with the long-term wetland protection and enhancement goals for which the easement or 30-year contract was established; and

      (iii) Complies with a WRPO developed with NRCS.

      (3) The State Conservationist will provide public notice of the availability of the reserved rights pilot and the reserved rights template deed or 30-year contract, approved by the Chief, to be used in the pilot.

      (4) Compensation for easements or 30-year contracts entered into under the reserved rights pilot will be based on the method described in § 1467.8 with the following exceptions:

      (i) Section 1467.8(a)(3)(i) is adjusted to reduce the fair market value of the land by an amount equal to the value of the retained grazing rights as determined by a Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices appraisal or a market survey; and

      (ii) Section 1467.8(a)(3)(ii) is adjusted to reduce the geographic area rate cap determined as described in § 1467.8(a)(4) by an amount equal to the value of the retained grazing rights.

      § 1467.10   Cost-share payments.

#### § § 1467.10

      (a) NRCS may share the cost with participants of implementing the WRPO on the enrolled land. The amount and terms and conditions of the cost-share assistance shall be subject to the following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing conservation practices or activities specified in the WRPO:

      (1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, NRCS will offer to pay at least 75 percent but not more than 100 percent of such costs; and

      (2) On enrolled land subject to a non-permanent easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement, NRCS will offer to pay at least 50 percent but not more than 75 percent of such costs.

      (3) The total amount of payments that a person or legal entity may receive, directly or indirectly, for one or more restoration cost-share agreements, for any year, may not exceed $50,000.

      (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by NRCS that an eligible conservation practice or component of the conservation practice has been implemented in compliance with appropriate NRCS standards and specifications; or an eligible activity has been implemented in compliance with the appropriate requirements detailed in the WRPO. Identified conservation practices or activities may be implemented by the participant, NRCS, or other NRCS designee.

      (c) Cost-share payments may be made for replacement of an eligible conservation practice, if NRCS determines that the practice is still needed and that the failure of the original conservation practice was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.

      (d) A participant may seek additional cost-share assistance from other public or private organizations as long as the conservation practices or activities funded are in compliance with this part. In no event shall the participant receive an amount that exceeds 100 percent of the total actual cost of the restoration.

      § 1467.12   The WRPO development.

#### § § 1467.12

      (a) The development of the WRPO will be made through the local NRCS representative, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, with consideration of site-specific technical input from FWS and the Conservation District.

      (b) The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land shall be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO will be developed to ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the on-site alternations and the off-site watershed conditions that adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife and wetland functions and values. NRCS will review, revise, and supplement the WRPO as needed throughout the duration of the enrollment to ensure that program goals are fully and effectively achieved.

> [74 FR 2328, Jan. 15, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 26285, June 2, 2009]

      § 1467.13   Modifications.

#### § § 1467.13

      (a)  (1) After an easement has been recorded, no modification will be made in the easement except by mutual agreement with the Chief and the participant. The Chief will consult with FWS and the Conservation District prior to making any modifications to easements.

      (2) Approved modifications will be made only in an amended easement, which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of liens, and recordation.

      (3) The Chief may approve modifications to facilitate the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program so long as the modification will not adversely affect the wetland functions and values for which the easement was acquired or when adverse impacts will be mitigated by enrollment and restoration of other lands that provide greater wetland functions and values at no additional cost to the government.

      (4) Modifications must result in equal or greater environmental and economic values to the United States and address a compelling public need, as determined by the Chief.

      (b)  Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable law, the State Conservationist may approve modifications to the WRPO that do not affect provisions of the easement in consultation with the participant and with consideration of site specific technical input from the FWS and the Conservation District. Any WRPO modification must meet WRP regulations and program objectives, comply with the definition of wetland restoration as defined in § 1467.3, must result in equal or greater wildlife benefits, wetland functions and values, and ecological and economic values to the United States.

      § 1467.14   Transfer of land.

#### § § 1467.14

      (a)  Any transfer of the property prior to the enrollment of the easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement contract, including the landowner entering into a contract or purchase agreement to sell the land subject to offer, shall void the offer of enrollment.

      (b)  For easements with multiple annual payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original participant unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.

      (c)  With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, NRCS shall bear no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original participant and the participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, NRCS may withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.

      § 1467.15   Violations and remedies.

#### § § 1467.15

      (a)  (1) In the event of a violation of the easement, 30-year contract, or any restoration cost-share agreement involving the participant, the participant shall be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation at the landowner's expense.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed necessary to protect important wetland functions and values or other rights of the United States under the easement. The participant shall be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the participant's negligence or failure to comply with easement or contractual obligations.

      (3) At any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants or any associated agreement, the easement shall remain in force and NRCS may withhold or require the refund of any easement and cost-share payments owed or paid to participants. Such withheld or refunded funds may be used to offset costs incurred by the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages pursuant to court order or settlement agreement. This remedy is in addition to any and all legal or equitable remedies available to the United States under applicable Federal or State law.

      (4) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action.

      (b)  (1) If the NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the 30-year contract or restoration cost-share agreement, the participant shall be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation. If the violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the 30-year contract or restoration cost-share agreement.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has:

      (i) Submitted false information;

      (ii) Filed a false claim;

      (iii) Engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or

      (iv) Taken actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.

      (3) If NRCS terminates a restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, the participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, and must refund all or part, as determined by NRCS, of the payments received, plus interest.

      § 1467.16   Payments not subject to claims.

#### § § 1467.16

      Any cost-share, contract, or easement payment or portion thereof due any person under this part shall be allowed without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.

      § 1467.17   Assignments.

#### § § 1467.17

      Any person entitled to any cash payment under this program may assign the right to receive such cash payments, in whole or in part.

      § 1467.18   Appeals.

#### § § 1467.18

      (a) A person participating in the WRP may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility for participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR part 614.

      (b) Before a person may seek judicial review of any administrative action taken under this part, the person must exhaust all administrative appeal procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and for purposes of judicial review, no decision shall be a final Agency action except a decision of the Chief of the NRCS under these procedures.

      (c) Any appraisals, market analysis, or supporting documentation that may be used by the NRCS in determining property value are considered confidential information, and shall only be disclosed as determined at the sole discretion of the NRCS in accordance with applicable law.

      (d) Enforcement actions undertaken by the NRCS in furtherance of its federally held property rights are under the jurisdiction of the federal courts and not subject to review under administrative appeal regulations.

      § 1467.19   Scheme and device.

#### § § 1467.19

      (a) If it is determined by the NRCS that a participant has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program payment otherwise due or paid such participant during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded with interest thereon, as determined appropriate by NRCS.

      (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of payments for cost-share practices, contracts, or easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which a person would otherwise not be entitled.

      (c) A participant who succeeds to the responsibilities under this part shall report in writing to the NRCS any interest of any kind in enrolled land that is held by a predecessor or any lender. A failure of full disclosure will be considered a scheme or device under this section.

      § 1467.20   Market-based conservation initiatives.

#### § § 1467.20

      (a)  Section 1241(e) of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 3841(e)), allows the Chief to accept and use contributions of non-Federal funds to support the purposes of the program. These funds shall be available without further appropriation and until expended, to carry out the program.

      (b)  (1) USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation practices and activities funded through WRP, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a WRP easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that the requirements of the WRPO, contract, and easement deed are met. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a WRP easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement, participants are highly encouraged to request a compatibility assessment from NRCS prior to entering into such agreements.

      (2) Section 1222(f)(2) of the Food Security Act of 1985 as amended, does not allow wetlands restored with Federal funds to be utilized for Food Security Act wetland mitigation purposes.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 571, Jan. 6, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1468.1   Applicability.

#### § § 1468.1

        (a) The regulations in this part set forth requirements, policies, and procedures for implementation of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ACEP purposes include:

        (1) Combining the purposes and coordinating the functions of the Wetlands Reserve Program established under section 1237, the Grassland Reserve Program established under section 1238N, and the Farmland Protection Program established under section 1238I, as such sections were in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Agricultural Act of 2014;

        (2) Restoring, protecting, and enhancing wetlands on eligible land;

        (3) Protecting the agricultural use and future viability, and related conservation values, of eligible land by limiting nonagricultural uses of that land that negatively affect the agricultural uses and conservation values; and

        (4) Protecting grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring or conserving eligible land.

        (b) The NRCS Chief may implement ACEP in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        (c) Subpart B of this part sets forth additional requirements, policies, and procedures for implementation of the Agricultural Land Easements (ALE) component of ACEP.

        (d) Subpart C of this part sets forth additional requirements, policies, and procedures for the Wetland Reserve Easement (WRE) component of ACEP.

        (e) Easement lands previously enrolled under the predecessor programs Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (7 CFR part 1491), the Grassland Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1415), and the Wetlands Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1467) are considered enrolled in ACEP. Existing easements and agreements remain valid and enforceable, and subject to the legal framework in place at the time of enrollment, except that the long-term stewardship and management of these easements, and any ACEP funding made available for implementation, will be in accordance with this part.

        § 1468.2   Administration.

#### § § 1468.2

        (a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the general supervision and direction of the NRCS Chief.

        (b) NRCS may seek advice from the State technical committee on considerations relating to implementation and technical aspects of the program, such as identification of lands of statewide importance or special significance, review of State-level geographic area rate caps, development of ranking criteria, wetland restoration objectives, management considerations, including compatible use criteria, or related technical matters.

        (c) NRCS may obtain input from Federal or State agencies, conservation districts, or other organizations in program administration. No determination by these agencies or organizations will compel NRCS to take any action which NRCS determines does not serve the purposes of the program established by this part.

        (d) Applications may be submitted on a continuous basis or in response to specific program solicitations. NRCS may announce one or more application cut-off dates for funding consideration within a given fiscal year.

        (e) The Chief may allocate funds for purposes related to: Encouraging enrollment by beginning farmers or ranchers, socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, limited resource farmers or ranchers, Indian Tribes, and veteran farmers or ranchers as authorized by 16 U.S.C. 3844; implementing landscape and related initiatives, special pilot programs for easement management and monitoring; agreements with other agencies and organizations to assist with program implementation; coordination of easement enrollment across State boundaries; coordination of the development of easement plans for ACEP-WRE or conservation plans for ACEP-ALE; or for other goals of the ACEP found in this part.

        (f) NRCS may delegate at any time its ACEP-WRE monitoring or management responsibilities to conservation organizations that have appropriate authority, expertise and technical and financial resources, as determined by NRCS, to carry out such delegated responsibilities.

        (g) NRCS may delegate at any time its ACEP-WRE monitoring, management, or enforcement responsibilities to other Federal or State agencies that have the appropriate authority, expertise, and technical and financial resources, as determined by NRCS, to carry out such delegated responsibilities.

        (h) For ACEP-ALEs, the easement holder is responsible to ensure the easement is monitored on an annual basis and to provide annually to NRCS a monitoring report. For ACEP-WREs, NRCS or its delegate, is responsible to monitor the easement on an annual basis and comply with applicable reporting requirements.

        (i) No delegation in the administration of this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part.

        (j) The Chief may modify or waive nonstatutory, discretionary provisions of this part if the Chief determines the waiver of such discretionary provision is necessary to further the purposes of ACEP as part of an ACEP-ALE buy-protect-sell transaction or under the ACEP-WRE wetland reserve enhancement partnership option. The waiver must further ACEP purposes and be consistent with the specific ACEP-WRE or ACEP-ALE conservation purposes and objectives. No waiver will result in reducing the quality of wetland functions and values restored under ACEP-WRE, or the protection of agricultural viability under ACEP-ALE.

        (k) To assist in ACEP implementation the Chief may also waive the applicability of the adjusted gross income limitation as authorized by section 1001D(b)(3) of the Food Security Act of 1985 for participating landowners if the Chief determines that environmentally sensitive land of special significance would be protected as a result of such waiver.

        § 1468.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1468.3

        The definitions in this section apply to this part, and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:

        means an ACEP-WRE contract that is for a duration of 30 years and is limited to acreage owned by Indian Tribes.

        means legal and physical ingress and egress to the entire easement area over adjacent or contiguous lands for the exercise of any of the rights or interests under the easement for the duration of its term for the purposes of the program. _Access_ for easement enrollments must be described in the easement deed.

        means lands held in private ownership by an Indian Tribe or individual Tribal member and lands held in trust by a native corporation, Tribe, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This land may be also be referred to as “Tribal land.”

        means the document that specifies the rights, requirements, and responsibilities of NRCS and any persons, legal entities, or eligible entities participating in the program or any document that authorizes the transfer of assistance between NRCS and a third party for provision of authorized goods and services associated with program implementation. _Agreement_s may include but are not limited to an agreement to purchase, an ALE-agreement, a buy-protect-sell arrangement, a wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, a cooperative agreement, a grant agreement, a partnership agreement, or an interagency agreement.

        means the legal document that is the equivalent of a real estate purchase and sale contract. The landowner signs the agreement to purchase, which is the authorization for NRCS to proceed with the ACEP-WRE acquisition process.

        means any agricultural commodity planted and produced in a State by annual tilling of the soil, including tilling by one-trip planters or sugarcane planted and produced in a State.

        means an easement or other interest in eligible land that is conveyed for the purposes of protecting natural resources and the agricultural nature of the land, and of promoting agricultural viability for future generations, and permits the landowner the right to continue agricultural production and related uses.

        means a document developed by the eligible entity that describes the activities which promote the long-term viability of the land to meet the purposes for which the easement was acquired. An agricultural land easement plan includes a description of the farm or ranch management system and the natural resource concerns on the land, describes the conservation measures and practices that may be implemented to address applicable resource concerns for which the easement was enrolled, and incorporates by reference any component plans such as a grasslands management plan, forest management plan, or conservation plan as defined in this part.

        means those activities defined by a State's farm or ranch land protection program or where no program exists, by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS determines that a State definition of agricultural use is so broad that an included use would constitute a violation of Federal law, limit future agricultural viability, degrade soils or the agricultural nature of the land or the related natural resources, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property to be subject to an agricultural land easement. These deed restrictions would narrow the State definition of agricultural use in order to meet Federal law, or to protect soils, the agricultural nature of the land, or related natural resources.

        means the document that outlines the rights, requirements, roles, and responsibilities of NRCS and eligible entities participating in the program under subpart B, including cost-share payment provisions.

        means any plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered; proposed or candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act; a species listed as threatened or endangered under State law or Tribal law on Tribal land; State or Tribal land species of conservation concern; or other plant or animal species or community, as determined by the State conservationist, with advice from the State technical committee or Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, that has undergone, or is likely to undergo, population decline and may become imperiled without direct intervention.

        means a person, Indian Tribe, Tribal corporation, or legal entity who:

        (1) Has not operated a farm, ranch, or non-industrialized private forest land (NIPF), or who has operated a farm, ranch, or NIPF for not more than 10 consecutive years. This requirement applies to all members of an entity who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or  NIPF.

        (2) In the case of an individual, individually, or with the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and management of the farm, ranch, or NIPF consistent with the practices in the county or State where the farm is located.

        (3) In the case of a legal entity or joint operation, all members must materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF . Material and substantial participation requires that each of the members provide some amount of the management or labor and management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF would be seriously impaired.

        means a legal arrangement between an eligible entity and NRCS relating to land owned or being purchased by an eligible entity on a transitional basis during which an agricultural land easement will be secured on eligible private or Tribal land, and ownership of the land transferred to a qualified farmer or rancher following conditions specified in this part.

        means an eligible entity that NRCS has determined to meet the certification requirements in § 1468.26 for the purposes of ACEP-ALE.

        means the _Chief_ of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the person delegated the authority to act for the Chief.

        means a wetland or converted wetland for which the Farm Service Agency (FSA) has determined that the wetland manipulation was contracted for, started, or for which financial obligation was incurred before December 23, 1985.

        is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Agriculture.

        means a use or activity conducted on a wetland reserve easement that NRCS determines, in its sole discretion, is consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland and other natural values of the easement area when performed according to amount, method, location, timing, frequency, intensity, and duration limitations prescribed by NRCS.

        is for ACEP-ALE the document that—

        (1) Applies to highly erodible cropland;

        (2) Describes the conservation-system applicable to the highly erodible cropland and describes the decisions of the person with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment measures and schedules and where appropriate, may include conversion of highly erodible cropland to less intensive uses; and

        (3) Is developed in accordance with 7 CFR part 12.

        means a specified treatment, such as a vegetative, structural, or land management practice, that is planned and applied according to NRCS standards and specifications.

        means the program administered by the CCC as required by 16 U.S.C. 3831-3836.

        means a wetland that has been drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated (including the removal of woody vegetation or any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow, circulation, or reach of water) for the purpose of, or to have the effect of, making possible the production of an agricultural commodity if such production would not have been possible but for such action, and before such action such land was wetland, farmed wetland, or farmed-wetland pasture and was neither highly erodible land nor highly erodible cropland.

        means the payment made by NRCS to an eligible entity for the purchase of an ACEP-ALE easement as set forth in subpart B of this part.

        means an account held by a certified nongovernmental organization which is sufficiently capitalized for the purpose of covering expenses associated with the management, monitoring, and enforcement of agricultural land easements and where such account cannot be used for other purposes.

        means an easement subordination, easement modification, easement exchange, or easement termination.

        means the portion of a parcel that is encumbered by an ACEP easement.

        means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, relinquishes all or a portion of its rights or interests in an easement which are replaced by similar rights or interests in an easement that have equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States on land that is not adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to exchange any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement exchanges are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement.

        means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, agrees to adjust the boundaries or terms of an easement that will result in equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States, and the modification only involves lands within or physically adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to modify any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement modifications are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement that are subject to the requirements of this part.

        § 1468.4   Appeals.

#### § § 1468.4

        (a)  An entity which has submitted an ACEP-ALE application to be considered an eligible entity may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning their eligibility for participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR parts 11 and 614.

        (b)  An applicant or participant in the ACEP-WRE may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility for participation or receipt of payment utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR parts 11 and 614.

        (c)  NRCS determinations that are made pursuant to its rights or interests in an ACEP-funded easement after closing may only be appealed to the State conservationist as specified in the notice provided to the landowner or easement holder when NRCS exercises its rights under the easement. Such determinations are not subject to appeal under 7 CFR parts 11 or 614.

        § 1468.5   Scheme or device.

#### § § 1468.5

        (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions, or remedies that may apply, if it is determined by NRCS that anyone has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program payment otherwise due or paid during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded with interest, thereon, as determined appropriate by NRCS.

        (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving anyone of a program benefit, or for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which they would otherwise not be entitled.

        § 1468.6   Subordination, exchange, modification, and termination.

#### § § 1468.6

        (a) After an easement has been recorded, no subordination, modification, exchange, or termination will be made in any interest in land, or portion of such interest, except as approved by the NRCS. NRCS may approve such easement administration actions if NRCS determines, in accordance with the sequencing considerations under the National Environmental Policy Act, that—

        (1)(i) The subordination, modification, or exchange action results in no net loss of easement acres, and is in the public interest or will further the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program, as determined by the NRCS, or

        (ii) The termination action will address a compelling public need for which there is no practicable alternative even with avoidance and minimization, and will further the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program, as determined by the NRCS.

        (2) For modification or exchange actions—

        (i) There is no reasonable alternative that would avoid the easement area, or if the easement area cannot be avoided entirely, then the preferred alternative must minimize impacts to the original easement area and its conservation functions and values to the greatest extent practicable and any remaining adverse impacts must be mitigated, as determined by NRCS, at no cost to the government,

        (ii) The action is consistent with the original intent of the easement and is consistent with the purposes of the program, and

        (iii) The action results in equal or greater conservation functions and value and equal or greater economic value to the United States. A determination of equal or greater economic value to the United States will be made in accordance with an approved easement valuation methodology for agricultural land easements under subpart B or for wetland reserve easements under subpart C. In addition to the value of the easement itself, NRCS may consider other financial investments it has made in the acquisition, restoration, and management of the original easement to ensure that the easement administration action results in equal or greater economic value to the United States.

        (3) For subordination actions, the action—

        (i) Increases conservation functions and values or has a limited negative effect on conservation functions and values;

        (ii) Is at no cost to the Government; and

        (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(5) of this section, will only minimally affect the acreage subject to the interest in land.

        (4) For termination actions, the action—

        (i) Is in the interest of the Federal Government; and

        (ii) The United States will be fully compensated for the fair market value of the interest in land including any costs and damages related to the termination.

        (5) The easement administration action will not affect more than 10 percent of the original easement area unless NRCS determines that it is impracticable to achieve program purposes on the original easements area, in which case NRCS may authorize a greater percentage of the original easement area to be affected.

        (6) The landowner and, if applicable, the agricultural land easement holder agrees to such easement administration action prior to NRCS considering that such easement administration action may be approved.

        (b) Easement subordinations or modifications are preferred to easement exchanges that may involve lands that are not physically adjacent to the original easement area. Easement exchanges are limited to circumstances where there are no available lands adjacent to the original easement area that will result in equal or greater conservation and economic values to the United States.

        (c) Replacement of easement acres as part of an easement exchange must occur within the same State and within the same eight-digit watershed as determined by the hydrologic unit codes developed by the U.S. Geological Survey.

        (d) Where NRCS determines that recordation of an amended or new easement deed is necessary to affect an easement administration action under this section, NRCS may use the most recent version of the ACEP deed document or deed terms approved by NRCS. The amended or new easement deed must be duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of liens, and recordation of documents.

        (e) Modification or exchange of all or a portion of an interest in land enrolled in ACEP-ALE may not increase any payment to an easement holder.

        (f)(1) A termination action must meet criteria identified in this part and are limited to those circumstances where NRCS determines it is in the Federal Government's interest to terminate all or a portion of the interest in the land enrolled in the program, that the purposes of the program can no longer be achieved on the original easement area, or the terms of the easement are no longer enforceable and there are no acceptable replacement acres available.

        (2) NRCS will enter into a compensatory agreement with the proponent of the termination that identifies the costs for which the United States must be reimbursed, including but not limited to the value of the easement itself based upon current valuation methodologies, repayment of legal boundary survey costs, legal title work costs, associated easement purchase and restoration costs, legal filing fees, costs relating to the termination, and any damages determined appropriate by NRCS.

        (3) At least 90 days prior to taking any termination action, written notice of such termination action will be provided to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

        (g) Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable law, NRCS may approve modifications to an easement plan that do not affect provisions of the easement. Easement plans include any conservation plan, WRPO, wetland reserve easement restoration agreements, grazing management plan, habitat management plans, or other plans required as a condition of enrollment. Any easement plan modification must meet this part and must result in equal or greater conservation benefits on the enrolled land.

        § 1468.21   Application procedures.

#### § § 1468.21

        (a) To apply for enrollment an eligible entity must submit an entity application for an ALE-agreement and any associated individual parcel applications to NRCS. For buy-protect-sell transactions, additional information may be required at the time of application as identified by NRCS.

        (b) NRCS may conduct initial eligibility determinations for the fiscal year an application is submitted. As determined by NRCS, the entity eligibility requirements must be met for the fiscal year in which the ALE-agreement is executed, and the land and landowner must be eligible for the fiscal year the parcel is approved for funding through an ALE-agreement. NRCS eligibility determinations are based on the application materials provided by the eligible entity, onsite assessments, and the criteria in § 1468.20.

        § 1468.22   Establishing priorities, ranking considerations, and project selection.

#### § § 1468.22

        (a) NRCS will use national and State criteria to rank and select eligible parcels for funding. The national ranking criteria will comprise at least half of the ranking score. The State criteria will be developed by NRCS on a State-by-State basis, with input from the State technical committee. The weighting of ranking criteria, including adjustments to account for geographic differences, will be developed to maximize the benefit of the Federal investment under the program. Parcels are ranked and selected for funding at the State level.

        (b) The national ranking criteria are—

        (1) Percent of prime, unique, and other important farmland soils in the parcel to be protected;

        (2) Percent of cropland, rangeland, grassland, historic grassland, pastureland, or nonindustrial private forest land in the parcel to be protected;

        (3) Ratio of the total acres of land in the parcel to be protected to average farm size in the county according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture;

        (4) Decrease in the percentage of acreage of farm and ranch land in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;

        (5) Percent population growth in the county as documented by the United States Census;

        (6) Population density (population per square mile) as documented by the most recent United States Census;

        (7) Existence of a farm or ranch succession plan or similar plan established to address agricultural viability for future generations;

        (8) Proximity of the parcel to other protected land, such as military installations; land owned in fee title by the United States or an Indian Tribe, State or local government, or by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values; or land that is already subject to an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to nonagricultural use or protects grazing uses and related conservation values;

        (9) Proximity of the parcel to other agricultural operations and agricultural infrastructure;

        (10) Maximizing the protection of contiguous or proximal acres devoted to agricultural use;

        (11) Whether the land is currently enrolled in CRP in a contract that is set to expire within 1 year and is grassland that would benefit from protection under a long-term easement or is land under a CRP contract that is in transition to a covered farmer or rancher pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3835(f);

        (12) Decrease in the percentage of acreage of permanent grassland, pasture, and rangeland, other than cropland and woodland pasture, in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;

        (13) Percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement that is the eligible entity's own cash resources for payment of easement compensation to the landowner and comes from sources other than the landowner; and

        (14) Other criteria as determined by NRCS.

        (c) State or local criteria as determined by NRCS, with advice of the State technical committee, may only include—

        (1) The location of a parcel in an area zoned for agricultural use;

        (2) The eligible entity's performance in managing and enforcing easements. Performance must be measured by the efficiency by which easement transactions are completed or percentage of parcels that have been monitored annually and the percentage of monitoring results that have been reported annually;

        (3) Multifunctional benefits of farm and ranch land protection including—

        (i) Social, economic, historic, and archaeological benefits;

        (ii) Enhancing carbon sequestration;

        (iii) Improving climate change resiliency;

        (iv) At-risk species protection;

        (v) Reducing nutrient runoff and improving water quality;

        (vi) Other related conservation benefits.

        (4) Geographic regions where the enrollment of particular lands may help achieve national, State, and regional agricultural or conservation goals and objectives, or enhance existing government or private conservation projects;

        (5) Diversity of natural resources to be protected or improved;

        (6) Score in the land evaluation and site assessment system as identified in 7 CFR part 658 or equivalent measure for grassland enrollments, to serve as a measure of agricultural viability (access to markets and infrastructure);

        (7) Measures that will be used to maintain or increase agricultural viability, such as succession plans, agricultural land easement plans, or entity deed terms that specifically address long-term agricultural viability; and

        (8) Other criteria determined by NRCS that will account for geographic differences provided such criteria allow for the selection of parcels that will achieve ACEP-ALE purposes and continue to maximize the benefit of the Federal investment under the program.

        (d) If NRCS determines that the purchase of two or more agricultural land easements are comparable in achieving program goals, NRCS will not assign a higher priority to any one of these agricultural land easements solely on the basis of lesser cost to the program.

        (e) NRCS will rank all eligible parcels that have been submitted prior to an application cut-off date in accordance with the national and State ranking criteria before selecting parcels for funding.

        (f) Eligible parcels selected for funding by NRCS will be identified in an agreement executed by NRCS and an eligible entity, either as part of the ALE-agreement or through a supplemental arrangement as agreed to by the parties.

        (g) Pursuant to the terms of the ALE-agreement, eligible parcels may be selected for funding in a fiscal year subsequent to the fiscal year in which the parties entered into an ALE-agreement.

        § 1468.25   Agricultural land easement deeds.

#### § § 1468.25

        (a) Under ACEP-ALE, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity with which NRCS has entered into an ALE-agreement. The easement deed will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with ACEP-ALE goals and objectives for the term of the easement.

        (b) The term of an agricultural land easement must be in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent easement. In such cases where State law limits the term of a conservation easement, the easement term will be for the maximum duration allowed under State law.

        (c) The eligible entity may use its own terms and conditions in the agricultural land easement deed, but the agricultural land easement deed must provide for the effective administration, management, and enforcement of the agricultural land easement by the eligible entity or its successors and assigns and must address the deed requirements as specified by this part and by NRCS in the ALE-agreement.

        (d) All deeds, as further specified in the ALE-agreement, must address the following regulatory deed requirements:

        (1) Include a right of enforcement clause for NRCS. NRCS will specify the terms for the right of enforcement clause, including that such interest in the agricultural land easement:

        (i) May be used only if the terms and conditions of the easement are not enforced by the eligible entity;

        (ii) Extends to a right of inspection only if the holder of the easement fails to provide monitoring reports in a timely manner or NRCS has a reasonable and articulable belief that the terms and conditions of the easement have been violated;

        (iii) Remains in effect for the duration of the easement and any changes that affect NRCS's interest in the agricultural land easement must be reviewed and approved by NRCS under § 1468.6 of this part.

        (2) Specify that impervious surfaces will not exceed 2 percent of the ACEP-ALE easement area, excluding NRCS-approved conservation practices unless NRCS grants a waiver as follows:

        (i) The eligible entity may request a waiver of the 2-percent impervious surface limitation at the time an individual parcel is approved for funding,

        (ii) NRCS may waive the 2-percent impervious surface limitation on an individual easement basis, provided that no more than 10 percent of the easement area is covered by impervious surfaces,

        (iii) Before waiving the 2 percent limitation, NRCS will consider, at a minimum, population density; the ratio of open, prime, and other important farmland versus impervious surfaces on the easement area; the impact to water quality concerns in the area; the type of agricultural operation; parcel size; and the purposes for which the easement is being acquired,

        (iv) Eligible entities may submit an impervious surface limitation waiver process to NRCS for review and consideration. The eligible entities must apply any approved impervious surface limitation waiver processes on an individual easement basis, and

        (v) NRCS will not approve blanket waivers or entity blanket waiver processes of the impervious surface limitation. All ACEP-ALE easements must include language limiting the extent of impervious surfaces within the easement area.

        (3) Include an indemnification clause requiring the landowner to indemnify and hold harmless the United States from any liability arising from or related to the property enrolled in ACEP-ALE.

        (4) Include clauses requiring that any changes to the easement deed or easement area made after easement recordation_,_ including any amendment to the easement deed, any subordination of the terms of the easement or any modifications, exchanges, or terminations of some or all of the easement area, must be consistent with the purposes of the agricultural land easement and this part and must be approved by NRCS and the easement holder in accordance with § 1468.6 prior to recordation or else the action is null and void.

        (5) Prohibit commercial and industrial activities except those activities that NRCS has determined are consistent with the agricultural use of the land.

        (6) Limit the subdivision of the property subject to the agricultural land easement, except where State or local regulations explicitly require subdivision to construct residences for employees working on the property or where otherwise authorized by NRCS.

        (7) Prohibit subsurface mineral development unless the terms of the deed, as determined by NRCS, specify that any subsurface mineral development allowed by the eligible entity on the easement area must—

        (i) Be conducted in accordance with applicable State law;

        (ii) Have a limited and localized impact;

        (iii) Not harm the agricultural use and conservation values of the land subject to the easement;

        (iv) Not materially alter or affect the existing topography;

        (v) Comply with a subsurface mineral development plan that includes a plan for the remediation of impacts to the agricultural use or conservation values of the land subject to the easement and is approved by NRCS prior to the initiation of mineral development activity;

        (vi) Not be accomplished by any surface mining method;

        (vii) Be within the impervious surface limits of the easement under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

        (viii) Use practices and technologies that minimize the duration and intensity of impacts to the agricultural use and conservation values of the land subject to the easement; and

        (ix) Ensure that each area impacted by the subsurface mineral development are reclaimed and restored by the holder of the mineral rights at cessation of operation.

        (8) Include specific protections related to the purposes for which the agricultural land easement is being acquired, including provisions to protect historical or archaeological resources or grasslands of special environmental significance.

        (9) For parcels with highly erodible cropland, include terms that ensure compliance with the conservation plan that will be developed and managed in accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, and its associated regulations.

        (10) Include any additional provisions needed to address the attributes for which a parcel was ranked and selected for funding by NRCS, such as the purchase of the agricultural land easement, the development and maintenance of an agricultural land easement plan, or use of the minimum deed terms as described in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (11) Include terms, if required by the eligible entity, that identify an intent to keep the land subject to the agricultural land easement under ownership of a farmer or rancher.

        (12) Include other minimum deed terms specified by NRCS to ensure that ACEP-ALE purposes are met.

        (e) NRCS reserves the right to require additional specific language or require removal of language in the agricultural land easement deed to ensure the enforceability of the easement deed, protect the interests of the United States, or to otherwise ensure ALE purposes will be met.

        (f) For eligible entities that have not been certified, the deed document must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use as provided herein:

        (1) NRCS will make available for an eligible entity's use a standard set of minimum deed terms that satisfactorily address the deed requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and may be wholly incorporated along with the eligible entity's own deed terms into the agricultural land easement deed, or as an addendum that is attached and incorporated by reference into the deed. The standard minimum deed terms addendum will specify the terms that will prevail in the event of a conflict.

        (2) If an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms as published by NRCS, NRCS and the eligible entity will identify in the ALE-agreement the use of the standard minimum deed terms as a requirement and National Office review of individual deeds may not be required. NRCS may place priority on applications where an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms as published.

        (3) The eligible entity must submit all individual agricultural land easement deeds to NRCS at least 90 days before the planned easement closing date and be approved by NRCS in advance of use.

        (4) Eligible entities with multiple eligible parcels may submit an agricultural land easement deed template for review and approval. The deed templates must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use.

        (5) NRCS may conduct an additional review of the agricultural land easement deeds for individual parcels prior to the execution of the easement deed by the landowner and the eligible entity to ensure that they contain the same language as approved by the National Office and that the appropriate site-specific information has been included.

        (g) The eligible entity will acquire, hold, manage, monitor, and enforce the easement. The eligible entity may have the option to enter into an agreement with appropriately qualified governmental or private organizations that have no property rights or interests in the easement area to carry out easement monitoring, management, and enforcement responsibilities.

        (h) All agricultural land easement deeds acquired with ACEP-ALE funds must be recorded. The eligible entity will provide proof of recordation to NRCS within the timeframe specified in the ALE-agreement.

        (iii) Holds, manages, and monitors a minimum of 25 agricultural land conservation easements, of which a minimum of 10 of these easements are agricultural land easements under ACEP-ALE or its predecessor programs, and if the eligible entity is a nongovernmental organization, provides evidence that the eligible entity possesses a dedicated fund for the purposes of managing, monitoring, and enforcing each easement held by the eligible entity; and

        (7) Successfully met the responsibilities of the eligible entity under the applicable agreements with NRCS, as determined by NRCS, relating to agricultural land easements that the eligible entity has acquired under the program or any predecessor program;

        (b) NRCS will notify an eligible entity in writing whether they have been certified and the rationale for the agency's decision. When NRCS determines an eligible entity qualifies as certified—

        (1) NRCS may enter into an ALE-agreement with the certified entity that is for a period of a minimum of 5 fiscal years and not to exceed 7 fiscal years following the fiscal year the agreement is executed. NRCS will review and select parcel applications submitted for funding by certified entities as specified in § 1468.22. Funding for selected parcels is identified on an attachment to the ALE-agreement.

        (2) The terms of the ALE-agreement will include the regulatory deed requirements specified in § 1468.25 of this part that must be addressed in the deed to ensure that ACEP-ALE purposes will be met without requiring NRCS to pre-approve each easement transaction prior to closing.

        (i) Certified entities may purchase easements without NRCS approving the agricultural land easement deeds, baseline reports, titles, or appraisals before the purchase of the easement;

        (ii) Certified entities will prepare the agricultural land easement deeds, baseline reports, titles, and appraisals in accordance with NRCS requirements as identified in the ALE-agreement;

        (3) NRCS will conduct quality assurance reviews of a percentage of the closed agricultural land easement transactions and annual monitoring reports submitted by the certified entity; and

        (4) NRCS will provide the certified entity an opportunity to correct errors or remedy deficiencies identified in the NRCS quality assurance review. If the certified entity fails to remedy the identified items to NRCS's satisfaction, NRCS will consider whether to allow the certified entity to continue to purchase ALE-funded easements without prior NRCS approval, to decertify the entity in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or, require the certified entity to take administrative steps necessary to remedy the deficiencies.

        (c)(1) NRCS will conduct a quality assurance review of the certified entity a minimum of once every 3 fiscal years to ensure that the certified entities are meeting the certification criteria established in this section.

        (2) If NRCS determines that the certified entity no longer meets these criteria, the Chief will—

        (i) Provide the certified entity a specified period of time, at a minimum 180 days, in which to take such actions as may be necessary to correct the identified deficiencies, and

        (ii) If NRCS determines the certified entity does not meet the criteria established in this part after the 180 days, NRCS will send written notice of decertification. This notice will specify the actions that have not been completed to retain certification status, the actions the entity must take to regain certification status, the status of funds in the ALE-agreement; and the eligibility of the entity to apply for future ACEP-ALE funds. The entity may contest the notice of decertification in writing to NRCS within 20 calendar days of receipt of the notice of decertification. The entity's letter must provide specific reasons why the decision to decertify is in error.

        (3) The period of decertification may be up to 3 years, based upon the circumstances associated with the action.

        (4) The entity may submit a new request for certification to NRCS only after the decertification period has expired.

        § 1468.28   Violations and remedies.

#### § § 1468.28

        (a) In the event of a violation of the agricultural land easement terms, the agricultural land easement holder will notify the landowner and the violator, if different than the landowner, and NRCS. The landowner may be given reasonable notice and, where appropriate, an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation in accordance with the terms of the agricultural land easement.

        (b) In the event that the agricultural land easement holder, or its successors or assigns, fails to enforce any of the terms of the agricultural land easement as determined by NRCS, NRCS may exercise the United States' rights to enforce the terms of the agricultural land easement through any and all authorities available under Federal or State law.

        (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon and inspect the easement area if the annual monitoring report provided by the agricultural land easement holder documenting compliance with the agricultural land easement is insufficient or is not provided annually, the United States has a reasonable and articulable belief that the terms and conditions of the easement have been violated, or to remedy deficiencies or easement violations as it relates to the conservation plan in accordance with 7 CFR part 12. Prior to its inspection, NRCS will notify the agricultural land easement holder and the landowner and provide a reasonable opportunity for the agricultural land easement holder and the landowner to participate in the inspection.

        (d) In the event of an emergency, the entry onto the easement area may be made at the discretion of NRCS when the actions are deemed necessary to prevent, terminate, or mitigate a potential or unaddressed violation with notification to the landowner and the agricultural land easement holder provided at the earliest practicable time. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred by NRCS as a result of the landowner's failure to comply with the easement requirements as it relates to agricultural land easement violations.

        (e) The United States will be entitled to recover any and all costs from the eligible entity, or its successors or assigns, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action as it relates to the enforcement of the agricultural land easement.

        (f) In instances where an easement is terminated in whole or in part, the proponent of the termination action must pay to CCC an amount determined by NRCS.

        (g) If NRCS exercises its rights identified under an agricultural land easement NRCS will provide written notice to the agricultural land easement holder at their last-known address. The notice will set forth the nature of the noncompliance by the agricultural land easement holder, or its successors or assigns, and provide a 180-day period to cure. If the agricultural land easement holder fails to cure within the 180-day period, NRCS will take the action specified under the notice. NRCS reserves the right to decline to provide a period to cure if NRCS determines that imminent harm may result to the conservation values or other interest in land that it seeks to protect.

      Subpart C—Wetland Reserve Easements

        § 1468.30   Program requirements.

#### § § 1468.30

        (a)  (1) Under the ACEP-WRE, NRCS may purchase wetland reserve easements from eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands on eligible private or Tribal lands. A 30-year contract enrollment option is also available for acreage owned by Indian Tribes.

        (2) To participate in ACEP-WRE, a landowner must agree to the implementation of a WRPO, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, manage, and monitor the hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of eligible lands.

        (3) NRCS may provide financial assistance through an easement restoration agreement for the conservation practices and eligible activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values and associated habitats.

        (4) For ACEP-WRE enrollments, NRCS may implement such conservation practices and eligible activities through an agreement with the landowner, a contract with a vendor, an interagency agreement, or a cooperative agreement. The specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management actions authorized by NRCS, may be undertaken by the landowner, NRCS, or its designee.

        (5) The duration of a wetland reserve easement may be either perpetual, 30-years, or the maximum duration allowed by State law. The duration of a 30-year contract on acreage owned by Indian Tribes is 30 years.

        (b)  (1) No more than 25 percent of the total cropland in any county, as determined by the FSA, may be enrolled in CRP and ACEP-WRE, and no more than 15 percent of the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement under ACEP-WRE.

        (2) The limitations in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to areas devoted to windbreaks or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, or to cropland designated by NRCS with “subclass w” in the land capability classes IV through VIII because of severe use limitations due to factors related to excess water such as poor soil drainage, wetness, high water table, soil saturation, or inundation.

        (3) NRCS and the FSA will concur before a waiver of the 25-percent limit of paragraph (b)(1) of this section can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in ACEP-WRE. Such a waiver will only be approved if the waiver will not adversely affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 U.S.C. 3812.

        (c)  To be eligible to enroll in the ACEP-WRE, all landowners must be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions in 7 CFR part 12. Persons or legal entities must be in compliance with the Adjusted Gross Income Limitation provisions at 7 CFR part 1400 and:

        (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought;

        (2) Provide any documentation required by NRCS as necessary to determine eligibility; and

        (3) For easement applications, have been the landowner of such land for the 24-month period prior to the time of application unless it is determined by NRCS that:

        (i) The land was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous landowner or pursuant to the terms of an existing trust,

        (ii) The ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law, or

        (iii) The land was acquired under circumstances that give adequate assurances, as determined by NRCS, that such land was not acquired for the purposes of placing it in the program. Adequate assurances will include documentation that the change of ownership resulted from circumstances such as:

        (A) The prior landowner owned the land for 2 years or more and transferred ownership amongst members of the immediate family (father, mother, spouse, children, grandparents, or grandchildren),

        (B) A completion of a contract for deed entered into 24 months or more prior to the application date,

        (C) The new landowner had leased the land for agricultural purposes for 24 months or more prior to the application date, or

        (D) The easement area is a portion of a larger property where the majority portion was acquired for agriculture purposes.

        (4) Agree to provide such information to NRCS as the agency deems necessary to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes.

        (d)  When a parcel of land that has been accepted for enrollment into the ACEP-WRE is sold or transferred prior to NRCS purchase of the easement, NRCS will cancel the application or agreement to purchase and remove the acres from enrollment unless the new landowner meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and accepts the terms and conditions of enrollment. The new landowner must submit required documentation for NRCS review and execute any required agreements or contracts. The decision to approve and execute an enrollment transferred prior to closing is at NRCS's discretion.

        (e)  (1) Only private land or acreage owned by an Indian Tribe may be considered for enrollment into ACEP-WRE.

        (2) NRCS will determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration of such land and resultant wetland functions and values merit inclusion of such land in the program when considering the cost of acquiring the easement and the cost of the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, management, and monitoring.

        (3) Land will only be considered eligible for enrollment in the ACEP-WRE if NRCS determines that the enrollment of such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland function and values.

        (4) To be determined eligible, NRCS must also determine that such land is—

        (i) Farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on the wetlands, if such land is identified by NRCS as:

        (A) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland pastures, and agricultural lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop and retain wetland functions and values; or

        (B) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially restored; or

        (C) Farmed wetland and adjoining land enrolled in CRP that has the highest wetland functions and values and is likely to return to production after the land leaves CRP; or

        (D) A riparian area along a stream or other waterway that links, or after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands protected by the ACEP-WRE easement, another easement, or other device or circumstance that achieves the same objectives as an ACEP-WRE easement.

        (ii) Cropland or grassland that was used for agricultural production prior to flooding from the natural overflow of—

        (A) A closed basin lake, together with adjacent land that is functionally dependent upon it, if the State or other entity is willing to provide a 50-percent share of the cost of the easement; or

        (B) A pothole and adjacent land that is functionally dependent on it; and

        (C) The size of the parcel offered for enrollment is a minimum of 20 contiguous acres. Such land meets the requirement of likelihood of successful restoration only if the soils are hydric and the depth of water is 6.5 feet or less.

        (5) If land offered for enrollment is determined eligible under this section, then NRCS may also enroll land adjacent or contiguous to such eligible land together with the eligible land, if such land maximizes wildlife benefits and contributes significantly to wetland functions and values. Such adjacent or contiguous land may include buffer areas, created wetlands, noncropped natural wetlands, riparian areas that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(D) of this section, and restored wetlands, but not more than NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, determines is necessary to maximize wildlife benefits and contribute significantly to wetland functions and values. NRCS will not enroll as eligible adjacent or contiguous land any constructed wetlands that treat wastewater or contaminated runoff.

        (6) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must have sufficient access and be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management and monitoring of the area for program purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives as determined by NRCS.

        (f)  Land subject to an existing CRP contract may be enrolled in ACEP-WRE only if the land and landowner meet the requirements of this part and the enrollment is requested by the landowner and agreed to by NRCS. To enroll in ACEP-WRE, the CRP contract for the property must be terminated or otherwise modified subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by FSA and the landowner.

        (g)  The land specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section is not eligible for enrollment in the ACEP-WRE:

        (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commenced after December 23, 1985;

        (2) Land established to trees under the CRP, except in cases where the land meets all other WRE eligibility criteria, the established cover conforms to WRE restoration requirements and NRCS specifications, an active CRP contract will be terminated or otherwise modified upon purchase of the WRE easement, and any additional criteria NRCS uses to determine if enrollment of such lands would further the purposes of the program;

        (3) Lands owned by the United States other than held in trust for Indian Tribes;

        (4) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State or a unit of local government;

        (5) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection of wetland functions and values as would be provided by enrollment in ACEP-WRE;

        (6) Lands where the purposes of the program or implementation of restoration practices would be undermined due to onsite or offsite conditions, including, but not limited to—

        (i) Risk of hazardous materials or petroleum products either onsite or offsite;

        (ii) Permitted or existing rights of way, either onsite or offsite, for infrastructure development;

        (iii) Adjacent land uses, such as airports, that would either impede complete restoration or prevent wetland functions and values from being fully restored; or

        (7) Land which NRCS determines to have unacceptable exceptions to clear title or legal access that is encumbered, nontransferable, restricted, or otherwise insufficient.

        § 1468.31   Application procedures.

#### § § 1468.31

        (a)  To apply for enrollment, a landowner must submit an application to NRCS.

        (b)  By filing an application, the landowner consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values and for other activities, such as the ranking and development of the preliminary WRPO, that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to evaluate applications. The landowner is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.

        (c)  In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in ACEP-WRE, the landowner or someone other than the landowner may offer to contribute financially to the cost of the acquisition or restoration of the wetland reserve easement to leverage Federal funds. This offer must be made in writing to NRCS.

        § 1468.32   Establishing priorities, ranking consideration, and project selection.

#### § § 1468.32

        (a) When evaluating easements or 30-year contract applications from landowners, NRCS, with advice from the State technical committee, may consider:

        (1) The conservation benefits of obtaining an easement or other interest in the land, including but not limited to—

        (i) Habitat that will be restored for the benefit of migratory birds and wetland-dependent wildlife, including diversity of wildlife that will be benefitted or life-cycle needs that will be addressed;

        (ii) Extent and use of habitat that will be restored for threatened, endangered, or other at-risk species or number of different at-risk species benefitted;

        (iii) Protection or restoration of native vegetative communities;

        (iv) Habitat diversity and complexity to be restored;

        (v) Proximity and connectivity to other protected habitats;

        (vi) Extent of beneficial adjacent land uses;

        (vii) Proximity to impaired water bodies;

        (viii) Extent of wetland losses within a geographic area, including wetlands generally or specific wetland types;

        (ix) Capacity of the wetland to improve water quality;

        (x) Hydrology restoration potential, which must comprise at least 50 percent of the points for conservation benefits.

        (2) The cost effectiveness of each easement;

        (3) Whether the landowner or another person or entity is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds;

        (4) The extent to which the purposes of this part would be achieved on the land;

        (5) The productivity of the land;

        (6) The on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities;

        (7) Such other factors as NRCS determines are necessary to carry out the purposes of the program.

        (b) To the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, NRCS will give priority to—

        (1) Obtaining permanent easements over shorter term easements; and

        (2) Acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wetland-dependent wildlife or improving water quality, in coordination with FWS at the local level, as may be appropriate.

        (c) NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, may place higher priority on—

        (1) Certain land types or geographic regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve State and regional goals and objectives; and

        (2) Land that is currently enrolled in CRP in a contract that is set to expire within 1 year from the date of application or land under a CRP contract that is in transition to a covered farmer or rancher pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3835(f), and such land and is farmed wetland and adjoining land that has the highest wetland functions and values and is likely to return to production after the land leaves CRP.

        (d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part regarding priority ranking, NRCS may enroll eligible lands at any time to encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise to achieve program objectives. NRCS may, at any time, exclude enrollment of otherwise eligible lands if the participation of the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling or ineligible to participate.

        § 1468.33   Enrollment process.

#### § § 1468.33

        (a)  Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program.

        (b)  The notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS or the United States to enroll the proposed project in ACEP-WRE, nor does it bind the landowner to continue with enrollment in the program. The notice informs the landowner of NRCS's intent to continue the enrollment process on their land.

        (c) —(1)  For applications requesting enrollment through a wetland reserve easement, NRCS will present an agreement to purchase to the landowner which will describe the easement area, the easement compensation amount, the easement terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The easement compensation amount will be based upon the lowest of the fair market value of the land, the geographic area rate cap, or the landowner offer, as provided in § 1468.34 of this part. The landowner accepts enrollment in the ACEP-WRE by signing the agreement to purchase. NRCS will continue with easement acquisition activities after the property has been enrolled.

        (2)  For applications requesting enrollment of acreage owned by an Indian Tribe through the 30-year contract option, NRCS will present an agreement to enter 30-year contract to the Tribal landowner which will describe the contract area, the contract compensation amount, the contract terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The Tribal landowner accepts enrollment in the ACEP-WRE by signing the agreement to enter _30-year contract._ NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the 30-year contract has been executed.

        (d)  (1) The agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract is the enrollment document that establishes the terms of enrollment consistent with the terms and conditions of this part and identifies the—

        (i) Scope of the agreement between NRCS and the landowner,

        (ii) Basis for NRCS to obligate funds,

        (iii) Nature and method through which NRCS will provide ACEP-WRE technical and financial assistance to the landowner, and

        (iv) Withholding of the landowner's share of the restoration cost from the easement payment for applicable 30-year or nonpermanent easement or 30-year contract enrollments.

        (2) The agreement to purchase between NRCS and the landowner under the easement option also constitutes the agreement for—

        (i) Granting an easement on the enrolled land and sufficient access to the enrolled land as set forth under § 1468.37,

        (ii) Implementing a WRPO which provides for the restoration, protection, and management of the wetland functions and values,

        (iii) Recording the easement in accordance with applicable State law, and

        (iv) Ensuring the title to the easement is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed acceptable by NRCS and in accordance with Department of Justice Title Standards.

        (3) The terms of the easement identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section includes the landowner's agreement to the implementation of a WRPO identified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. In particular, the easement deed identifies that NRCS has the right to enter the easement area to undertake on its own or through an agreement with the landowner or other third party, any activities to restore, protect, enhance, manage, maintain, and monitor the wetland and other natural values of the easement area.

        (4) At the time NRCS enters into an agreement to purchase, NRCS agrees, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, to acquire and provide for restoration of the land enrolled into the program.

        (e)  Prior to execution of the easement deed or 30-year contract by the United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability to clear title, insufficient access, sale of the land, risk of contamination from hazardous materials or petroleum products, or other reasons.

        (f)  The offer of enrollment to the landowner will be void if not executed by the landowner within the time specified.

        § 1468.34   Compensation for easements and 30-year contracts.

#### § § 1468.34

        (a)  (1) Compensation for an easement or 30-year contract under this part will be made in cash in such amount as is agreed to and specified in the agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract and finalized in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract.

        (2) Payments for 30-year easements, nonpermanent easements as limited by State law, or 30-year contracts will be not more than 75 percent of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement as determined by the methods listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (3) NRCS will pay as compensation the lowest of the values from paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section:

        (i) The fair market value of the land using the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices or based on an area-wide market analysis or survey,

        (ii) The geographic area rate cap determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, or

        (iii) A written offer made by the landowner.

        (4) Each fiscal year NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, will establish one or more geographic area rate caps within a State. NRCS will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include soil types, types of crops capable of being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.

        (b)  (1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement payment may be less than the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement.

        (2)(i) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 10 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the agreement to purchase or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.

        (ii) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at more than $500,000, NRCS may provide compensation in at least 5, but not more than 10 annual payments. NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the NRCS Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the agreement to purchase or 30-year contract, entered into between NRCS and the landowner.

        (c)  For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse the landowner for fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as authorized and determined by NRCS.

        (d)  If easement or 30-year contract compensation values are calculated on a per-acre basis, NRCS will identify an estimated amount in its agreement to purchase and the final easement or 30-year contract payment will be made based on final determination of value and acreage and specified in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract.

        § 1468.35   Wetland Reserve Enhancement Partnerships.

#### § § 1468.35

        (a) The purpose of the Wetland Reserve Enhancement Partnership (WREP) option is to target and leverage resources to address high priority wetland protection, restoration, and enhancement objectives through agreements with States (including a political subdivision or agency of a State), nongovernmental organizations, or Indian Tribes.

        (b) NRCS will establish priorities for funding, required level of partner contribution of resources, ranking criteria, and other criteria. NRCS will prioritize proposals that address wetland restoration needs of national or regional importance, including special project or area-wide proposals.

        (c) NRCS will make the information regarding WREP available to the public and potential partners.

        (d) NRCS will evaluate proposals and make final funding selections based upon the priorities identified in the public notice of funding availability.

        (e) NRCS will enter into WREP agreements with partners who have projects selected for funding.

The amount and terms and conditions of the financial assistance will be subject to the restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on the costs of establishing or installing conservation practices or eligible activities specified in the WRPO:

        (1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, NRCS will offer to pay at least 75 percent but not more than 100 percent of such costs; and

        (2) On enrolled land subject to a 30-year or nonpermanent easement or 30-year contract, NRCS will offer to pay at least 50 percent but not more than 75 percent of such costs. The landowner's share of the WRPO implementation costs may be withheld from the easement or 30-year contract payment.

        (b) Payments may be made only upon a determination by NRCS that an eligible conservation practice or component of the conservation practice has been implemented in compliance with appropriate NRCS standards and specifications; or an eligible activity has been implemented in compliance with the appropriate requirements detailed in the WRPO.

        (c) Payments may be made for repair or replacement of an eligible conservation practice or activity, if NRCS determines that the conservation practice or eligible activity is still needed and that the disrepair or failure of the original conservation practice or eligible activity was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.

        (d) A participant may seek additional assistance from other public or private organizations as long as the conservation practices or eligible activities funded are approved by NRCS and implemented in compliance with this part.

#### § § 1468.38

        (a) The WRPO will be developed and updated as determined by NRCS in consultation with the State technical committee and consideration of available site-specific technical input from FWS at the local level and others as appropriate.

        (b) The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land will be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, managed, and monitored to accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO, and any revisions thereto, will be developed to ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the onsite alterations and the offsite watershed conditions that adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife, water quality, and wetland functions and values.

        (c) The WRPO will identify the conservation practices and eligible activities needed to restore the functions and values on the enrolled land. NRCS may review, revise, and supplement the WRPO as needed throughout the duration of the enrollment to ensure that program goals are fully and effectively achieved. Revisions to the WRPO may result in the addition of conservation practices or eligible activities needed to enhance, maintain, manage, repair, replace or otherwise to protect the functions and values of the easement or 30-year contract area.

        (d) As required by the terms of the easement deed as described in § 1468.37(a)(2)(ii) or 30-year contract as described in § 1468.37(b)(2)(ii), NRCS may, in its sole discretion, authorize the landowner to conduct compatible uses as defined in this part on the easement or contract area. Compatible use authorizations are time-limited and may be modified or rescinded at any time by NRCS. In evaluating and authorizing compatible uses of the easement or contract area, NRCS will—

        (1) Consider whether the authorized use will facilitate the practical administration and management of the land subject to the easement or contract; and

        (2) Ensure that the authorized use furthers the functions and values for which the easement or 30-year contract was enrolled.

        § 1468.39   Violations and remedies.

#### § § 1468.39

        (a)  (1) In the event of a violation of the easement involving the landowner, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as NRCS determines is necessary to correct the violation at the landowner's expense.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement or 30-year area at any time to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed necessary to protect important wetland functions and values or other rights of the United States under the easement. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the landowner's failure to comply with easement obligations.

        (3) If there is failure to comply with easement obligations, the easement will remain in effect, and NRCS may, in addition to any other remedy available to the United States, retain any payment otherwise required to be paid under this part and require the refund of any payment previously made under this part.

        (b)  (1) If NRCS determines that a landowner is in violation of the terms of a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as NRCS determines is necessary to correct the violation. If the violation continues, NRCS may terminate the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement.

        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the NRCS that the landowner has—

        (i) Submitted false information,

        (ii) Filed a false claim, or

        (iii) Engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part.

        (3) If NRCS terminates a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, the landowner will forfeit all rights for future payments under the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, and must refund all or part, as determined by NRCS, of the payments received, plus interest.

        § 1469.21   Contract requirements.

#### § § 1469.21

        (a) To receive payments, each participant must enter into a conservation stewardship contract and comply with its provisions. Among other provisions, the participant agrees to maintain at least the level of stewardship identified in the benchmark inventory for the portion of land being enrolled for the entire contract period, as appropriate, and implement and maintain any new practices or activities required in the contract.

        (b) Program participants will only receive payments from one conservation stewardship contract.

        (c) CSP participants must address the following requirements or additional resource concerns to the minimum level of treatment by the end of their conservation stewardship contract:

        (1) Tier I contract requirement: additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the part of the agricultural operation enrolled in CSP.

        (2) Tier II contract requirements:

        (i) Address an additional locally significant resource concern, as described in section III of the NRCS FOTG over the entire agricultural operation. Applicants may satisfy this requirement by demonstrating that the locally significant resource concern is not applicable to their operation or that they have already addressed it in accordance with NRCS'; quality criteria; and

        (ii) Additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the entire agricultural operation, where applicable.

        (3) Tier III contract requirement: additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the entire agricultural operation, where applicable.

        (d)  (1) Upon agreement by NRCS and the participant, a conservation stewardship contract may include provisions that lead to a higher tier of participation during the contract period. Such a transition does not require a contract modification if that transition is laid out in the schedule of contract activities. In the event that such a transition begins with Tier I, only the land area in the agricultural operation that meets the requirements for enrollment in Tier I can be enrolled in the contract until the transition occurs. Upon transition from Tier I to a higher tier of participation, the entire agricultural operation must be incorporated into the contract. All requirements applicable to the higher tier of participation would then apply. NRCS will calculate all stewardship, existing practice, new practice payments, and enhancement payments using the applicable enrolled acreage at the time of the payment.

        (2) A contract which transitions to higher tier(s) of participation must include:

        (i) A schedule for the activities associated with the transition(s);

        (ii) A date certain by which time the transition(s) must occur; and,

        (iii) A specification that the CSP payment will be based on the current Tier of participation, which may change over the life of the contract.

        (3) A contract which transitions to a higher tier will be modified to receive the higher payments once the required level of treatment has been achieved and field verified by NRCS.

        (4) A contract which includes a transition from Tier I to Tier II or III may be adjusted in length up to 10 years beginning from the original contract date.

        (e) A conservation stewardship contract must:

        (1) Incorporate by reference the conservation stewardship plan;

        (2) Be for 5 years for Tier I, and 5 to 10 years for Tier II or Tier III;

        (3) Incorporate all provisions as required by law or statute, including participant requirements to—

        (i) Implement and maintain the practices as identified and scheduled in the conservation stewardship plan, including those needed to be eligible for the specified tier of participation and comply with any additional sign-up requirements,

        (ii) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch that tend to defeat the purposes of the contract,

        (iii) Comply with the terms of the contract, or documents incorporated by reference into the contract. NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as determined by the State Conservationist, to correct any violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If a violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the conservation stewardship contract, and

        (iv) Supply records and information as required by CCC to determine compliance with the contract and requirements of CSP;

        (4) Specify the requirements for operation and maintenance of the applied conservation practices;

        (5) Specify the schedule of payments under the life of the contract, including how those payments—

        (i) Relate to the schedule for implementing additional conservation measures as described in the conservation stewardship plan,

        (ii) Relate to the actual implementation of additional conservation measures as described in the conservation stewardship plan, and

        (iii) May be adjusted by NRCS if the participant's management decisions change the appropriate set or schedule of conservation measures on the operation; and,

        (6) Incorporate any other provisions determined necessary or appropriate by NRCS, or included as a requirement for the sign-up.

        (f) Practices scheduled in contracts must be applied and maintained within the timelines specified in the contract.

        (g) Contracts expire on September 30 in the last year of the contract.

        (h) Participants must:

        (1) Implement the conservation stewardship contract approved by NRCS;

        (2) Make available to NRCS, appropriate records showing the timely implementation of the contract;

        (3) Comply with the regulations of this part; and

        (4) Not engage in any activity that interferes with the purposes of the program, as determined by NRCS.

        (i) NRCS will determine the payments under the contract as described in § 1469.23.

        (j) For contracts encompassing the entire agricultural operation, the geographic boundaries of the acreage enrolled in the contract must include all fields and facilities under the participant's direct control, as determined by NRCS.

        § 1469.22   Conservation practice operation and maintenance.

#### § § 1469.22

        (a) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of the conservation practice(s) applied under the contract.

        (b) The participant must operate and maintain any new conservation practice(s) for which a payment was received to ensure that the new practice or enhancement achieves its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation treatment, as identified in the contract or conservation stewardship plan, as determined by NRCS.

        (c) Conservation practices that are installed before the execution of a contract, but are needed in the contract to obtain the intended environmental benefits, must be operated and maintained as specified in the contract whether or not an existing practice payment is made.

        (d) NRCS may periodically inspect the conservation practices during the practice lifespan as specified in the contract to ensure that operation and maintenance are being carried out, and that the practice is fulfilling its intended objectives. When NRCS finds that a participant is not operating and maintaining practices installed through the CSP in an appropriate manner, NRCS will initiate contract violation procedures as specified in § 1469.25. If an existing practice is part of a system that meets the quality criteria, but does not technically meet NRCS minimum practice standards, the practice must be modified or updated to meet the standard according the FOTG as specified in § 1469.25(a) of this part.

        § 1469.23   Program payments.

#### § § 1469.23

        (a)  (1) The conservation stewardship plan, as applicable, divides the land area to be enrolled in the CSP into land use categories, such as irrigated and non-irrigated cropland, irrigated and non-irrigated pasture, pastured cropland and range land, among other categories.

        (2) NRCS will determine an appropriate stewardship payment rate for each land use category using the following methodology:

        (i) NRCS will initially calculate the average 2001 rates using the Agriculture Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA) Land Value Survey, the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) land rental data, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental rates.

        (ii) Where typical rental rates for a given land use vary widely within a State or between adjacent States, NRCS will adjust the county-level rates to ensure local and regional consistency and equity.

        (iii) The State Conservationists can also contribute additional local data, with advice from the State Technical Committee.

        (iv) The final stewardship payment rate will be the adjusted regional rates described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section multiplied by a reduction factor of 0.25 for Tier I, 0.50 for Tier II, and 0.75 for Tier III.

        (v) Pastured cropland will receive the same stewardship payment as cropland.

        (3) NRCS will compute the stewardship component of the CSP payment as the product of: the number of acres in each land use category (not including “other” or land not in the applicant's control); the corresponding stewardship payment rate for the applicable acreage; and a tier-specific percentage. The tier-specific percentage is 5 percent for Tier I payments, 10 percent for Tier II payments, and 15 percent for Tier III payments.

        (4) Other incidental parcels as defined in § 1469.5(d)(1)(iv) may be given a stewardship rate as though they were the land use to which they are contiguous if they are serving a conservation purpose, such as wildlife habitat. Payment is limited to not more than ten percent of the contract acres. Minimum treatment requirements for the contract tier apply.

        (5) Other land, as defined in § 1469.5(d)(1)(v), is not included in the stewardship payment computation.

        (6) NRCS will publish the stewardship payment rates at the announcement of each program sign-up.

        (b)  (1) The Chief will determine and announce which practices will be eligible for existing practice payments in accordance with § 1469.8(a).

        (2) With exceptions including, but not limited to, paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section, NRCS may pay the participant a percentage of the average 2001 county cost of maintaining a land management, and structural practice that is documented in the benchmark condition inventory as existing upon enrollment in CSP. The Chief may offer alternative payment methods such as paying a percentage of the stewardship payment as long as the payment will not exceed 75 percent (or, in the case of a beginning farmer or rancher, 90 percent) of the average 2001 county costs of installing the practice in the 2001 crop year. NRCS will post the rates for payment at the time of the sign-up notices on the NRCS website and in USDA Service Centers.

        (3) NRCS will not pay for maintenance of equipment.

        (4) NRCS will not pay an existing practice component of CSP payments for any practice that is required to meet conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.

        (5) Existing practice payments are not intended to pay for routine maintenance activities related to production practices or practices considered typical in farm and ranch operations for a specific location.

        (6) Existing practice payments will be made only on practices that meet or exceed the practice standards described in the FOTG.

        (7) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.

        (c)  (1) The Chief will determine and announce which practices will be eligible for new practice payments in accordance with § 1469.8(a).

        (2) If the conservation stewardship contract requires the implementation of a new structural or land management practice, NRCS may pay a percentage of the cost of installing the new practice. NRCS will provide the list of approved practices and the percentage cost-share rate for each practice at the time of each CSP sign-up notice.

        (3) Participants may contribute to their share of the cost of installing a new practice through in-kind sources, such as personal labor, use of personal equipment, or donated materials. Contributions for a participant's share of the practice may also be provided from non-Federal sources, as determined by the Chief.

        (4) Cost-share payments may be provided by other programs; except that payments may not be provided through CSP and another program for the same practice on the same land area.

        (5) If additional practices are installed or implemented to advance a contract from one tier of participation to a higher tier, the practice must be certified as meeting FOTG practice standards by NRCS.

        (6) In no instance will the total financial contributions for installing a practice from all public and private entity sources exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of installing the practice.

        (7) NRCS will not pay a new practice payment for any practice that is required to meet the conservation compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.

        (8) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.

        (d)  (1) The Chief will establish a list of conservation practices and activities that are eligible for enhancement payments for a given sign-up. State Conservationists, with advice from the State Technical Committees, will tailor the list to meet the needs of the selected watersheds and submit to the Chief for concurrence.

        (2) NRCS may pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a conservation stewardship plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of NRCS that the plan's activities will increase conservation performance including activities related to energy management as a result of additional effort by the participant and result in:

        (i) The improvement of a resource concern by implementing or maintaining multiple conservation practices or measures that exceed the minimum eligibility requirements for the contract's Tier of participation as outlined in the sign-up notice and as described in § 1469.5(e) and the contract requirements in § 1469.21; or

        (ii) An improvement in a local resource concern based on local priorities and in addition to the national significant resource concerns, as determined by NRCS.

        (3) NRCS may also pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a participant:

        (i) Participates in an on-farm conservation research, demonstration, or pilot project as outlined in the sign-up notice; or

        (ii) Cooperates with other producers to implement watershed or regional resource conservation plans that involve at least 75 percent of the producers in the targeted area; or

        (iii) Carries out assessment and evaluation activities relating to practices included in the conservation stewardship plan as outlined in the sign-up notice.

        (4) NRCS will not pay the enhancement component of a CSP payment for any practice that is required to meet the conservation compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.

        (5)  (i) State Conservationists, with advice from the State Technical Committees, will develop proposed enhancement payment amounts for each practice and activity.

        (ii) An enhancement payment will be made to encourage a producer to perform or continue a management practice or activity, resource assessment and evaluation project, or field-test a research, demonstration, or pilot project that produces enhanced environmental performance and benefits or produces information and data to improve a resource concern or update the NRCS technical guides. Enhancement payments will be:

        (A) For activities where NRCS can demonstrate the economic value of the environmental benefits, based on a given activity's expected environmental benefit value. The payment may not exceed the activity's expected economic value; or

        (B) For activities where NRCS cannot demonstrate the economic value of the environmental benefits, a rate that will not exceed a producer's cost to implement a given activity.

        (iii) NRCS will post the list of approved enhancement activities and payment amounts for each activity concurrent with the CSP sign-up notice.

        (6) The Chief may set a not-to-exceed limit or variable payment rate for the enhancement payment in any given sign-up notice.

        (7) Enhancements above the minimum criteria for the resource concern that are included in the benchmark inventory may be included in the first CSP payment.

        (e) Contracts will be limited as follows:

        (1) $20,000 per year for a Tier I conservation stewardship contract,

        (2) $35,000 per year for a Tier II conservation stewardship contract, or

        (3) $45,000 per year for a Tier III conservation stewardship contract.

        (4) Stewardship components of CSP payments cannot exceed $5,000 per year for Tier I, $10,500 per year for Tier II, or $13,500 per year for Tier III.

        (5) The new practice payment will not exceed 50 percent of the average county costs of installing the practice (or a similar practice, if new) in the 2001 crop year with the exception of beginning and limited resource producers, in which case the new practice payment may be up to 65 percent.

        (f) The new practice and enhancement components of the conservation stewardship contract payment may increase once the participant applies and agrees to maintain additional conservation practices and activities as described in the conservation stewardship plan.

        (g) The Chief of NRCS may limit the stewardship, practice, and enhancement components of CSP payments in order to focus funding toward targeted activities and conservation benefits the Chief identifies in the sign-up notice and any subsequent addenda.

        (h) In the event that annual funding is insufficient to fund existing contract commitments, the existing contracts will be pro-rated in that contract year.

        (i) NRCS may not make any payments to participants for:

        (1) Practices within their conservation stewardship plan that are required to meet conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12;

        (2) Practices that are included in maintenance agreements (with financial reimbursements for maintenance) that existed prior to the conservation stewardship contract approval;

        (3) Construction or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment facilities or associated waste transport or transfer devices for animal feeding operations;

        (4) The purchase or maintenance of equipment;

        (5) A non-land based structure that is not integral to a land based practice, as determined by the Chief; or

        (6) New practices that were applied with cost-share assistance through other USDA cost-share programs.

        § 1469.24   Contract modifications and transfers of land.

#### § § 1469.24

        (a) Contracts may be modified:

        (1) At the request of the participant, if the modification is consistent with the purposes of the conservation security program, or;

        (2) As required by the State Conservationist due to changes to the type, size, management, or other aspect of the agricultural operation that would interfere with achieving the purposes of the program.

        (b) Participants may request a modification to their contract to change their tier of participation under a conservation stewardship contract once the measures determined necessary by NRCS to meet the next tier level have been established.

        (c) Contract transfers are permitted when there is agreement among all parties to the contract and the contract area remains intact.

        (1) NRCS must be notified within 60 days of the transfer of interest and the transferee's acceptance of the contract terms and conditions, or the contract will be terminated.

        (2) The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be eligible and must assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation and maintenance of those conservation practices and activities already undertaken and to be undertaken as a condition of the contract.

        § 1469.25   Contract violations and termination.

#### § § 1469.25

        (a) If the NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a contract, or documents incorporated by reference into the contract, NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as determined by the State Conservationist, to correct the violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If the violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the conservation stewardship contract.

        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has: submitted false information; filed a false claim; engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or taken actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.

        (c) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, the participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the contract, and must refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest, and liquidated damages as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter. The State Conservationist may require only partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation practice can function independently, is not affected by the violation or other conservation practices that would have been installed under the contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.

        (d) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, or the participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual payments have been made, the participant will forfeit all rights for further payments under the contract, and must pay such liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist has the option to waive the liquidated damages, depending upon the circumstances of the case.

        (e) When making any contract termination decisions, the State Conservationist may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance with the contract including natural disasters or events.

        (f) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract, without penalty or repayment, if the State Conservationist determines that the contract terms and conditions have been fully complied with before termination of the contract.

        (g) In carrying out this section, the State Conservationist may consult with the local conservation district.

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 3839aa-21-3839aa-25.

**Source:** Source: 84 FR 60891, Nov. 12, 2019, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 1470.1   Applicability.

#### § § 1470.1

        (a) This part sets forth the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) as administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), for enrollment during fiscal year (FY) 2019 and thereafter. Contracts entered into prior to FY 2019 will use the regulations and policies in effect prior to December 20, 2018.

        (b) The purpose of CSP is to encourage producers to address priority resource concerns and improve and conserve the quality and condition of natural resources in a comprehensive manner by—

        (1) Undertaking additional conservation activities; and

        (2) Improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities.

        (c) CSP is applicable in any of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

        (d) NRCS provides financial and technical assistance to eligible producers.

        § 1470.2   Administration.

#### § § 1470.2

        (a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the general supervision and direction of the Chief, NRCS.

        (b) No delegation in the administration of this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part. The Chief may modify or waive a nonstatutory, discretionary provision of this part if the Chief determines the application of that provision to a particular limited situation is inappropriate and inconsistent with the purposes of the program.

        (c) To achieve the conservation goals of CSP, NRCS will—

        (1) Make the program available nationwide to eligible applicants on a continuous application basis with one or more ranking periods to determine enrollments. One of the ranking periods will occur in the first quarter of each fiscal year to the extent practicable.

        (2) Establish a science-based stewardship threshold for each priority resource concern at the level of management required to conserve and improve the quality and condition of a natural resource. To the extent practicable, NRCS will use scientifically developed assessment tools and guides including, but not limited to, soil erosion prediction tools, wildlife habitat assessment tools, rangeland health assessments, and soil health assessments, to establish the stewardship threshold and measure the level of improvement once the participant applies additional conservation activities to meet or exceed a resource concern.

        (3) To the maximum extent feasible, manage CSP to enhance soil health.

        (d) To support locally led conservation, NRCS will solicit input from State technical committees, Tribal Conservation Advisory Councils, and local working groups to develop State-level technical, outreach, and program materials, including:

        (1) Establishment of ranking pools appropriate for the conduct of CSP within the State to ensure program availability and better distribution of the funds. Ranking pools may be based on watersheds, geographic areas, or other appropriate regions within a State and may consider high-priority regional and State-level priority resource concern areas;

        (2) Identification of not less than five priority resource concerns in particular geographic areas or other appropriate regions within a State;

        (3) Identification of resource-conserving crops that will be part of resource-conserving crop rotations; and

        (4) Identification of combinations of grazing conservation activities that will be part of an advanced grazing management system.

        (e) NRCS may enter into agreements with Federal, State, and local agencies, conservation districts, Indian Tribes, private entities, and individuals to assist NRCS with program implementation including, but not limited to, planning activities, outreach, and providing other forms of technical assistance.

> [84 FR 60891, Nov. 12, 2019, as amended at 85 FR 64002, Oct. 9, 2020]

        § 1470.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1470.3

        The following definitions will apply to this part and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:

        means the use of a combination of grazing conservation activities, as determined by NRCS, which may include management-intensive rotational grazing, that provide for—

        (1) Improved soil health and carbon sequestration;

        (2) Drought resilience;

        (3) Wildlife habitat;

        (4) Wildfire mitigation;

        (5) Control of invasive plants; and

        (6) Water quality improvement.

        means all eligible land, as determined by NRCS, whether contiguous or noncontiguous that is—

        (1) Under the effective control of a producer at the time of enrollment in the program; and

        (2) Operated by the producer with equipment, labor, management, and production or cultivation practices that are substantially separate from other agricultural operations.

        means a producer who has requested in writing to participate in CSP.

        means a person or legal entity who—

        (1) Has not operated a farm, ranch, or nonindustrial private forest land (NIPF); or who has operated a farm, ranch, or NIPF for not more than 10 consecutive years. The requirement in this paragraph (1) applies to all members of a legal entity who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch.

        (2) In the case of a contract with an individual, individually, or with the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires that the individual provide substantial day- to-day labor and management of the farm or ranch, consistent with the practices in the county or State where the farm is located.

        (3) In the case of a contract with a legal entity or joint operation, all members must materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch.

#### § § 1470.24

        (a)  Subject to the availability of funds, NRCS will provide, as appropriate, annual payments under the program to compensate a participant for installing and adopting additional conservation activities, and for improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities across the entire agricultural operation in a manner that increases or extends the conservation benefits in place at the time NRCS accepts the contract offer. A split-rate annual payment structure is used to provide separate payments for additional and existing conservation activities in order to place emphasis on implementing additional conservation.

        (1) NRCS will make equal annual payments for the existing activity portion of the payment, specific to the operation, based on the land uses and NRCS assessment of existing stewardship. NRCS will make payments for the additional conservation activities based on the complexity and extent of the individual activities completed by the participant during the previous fiscal year. Additional activities implemented may vary from year to year, so the total annual payment may fluctuate;

        (2) In order to receive an annual payment for a land use, participants must schedule, install, and adopt at least one additional conservation activity on the land use type;

        (3) At least one additional conservation activity must be implemented within the first 12 months of the contract. NRCS may extend this timeframe if NRCS determines that the participant is unable to complete the conservation activity for reasons beyond their control;

        (4) NRCS will base the annual payment rates, to the maximum extent practicable, on the following factors:

        (i) Costs incurred by the participant associated with planning, design, materials, installation, labor, management, maintenance, or training;

        (ii) Income foregone by the participant;

        (iii) Expected conservation benefits;

        (iv) The extent to which priority resource concerns will be addressed through the installation and adoption of conservation activities on the agricultural operation;

        (v) The level of stewardship in place at the time of application and maintained over the term of the contract;

        (vi) The degree to which the conservation activities will be integrated across the entire agricultural operation for all State identified priority resource concerns over the term of the contract; and

        (vii) Such other factors as determined by the Chief; and

        (5) Participants will receive payments for cover crop activities at not less than 125 percent of the annual payment amount, as determined by NRCS.

        (b)  Subject to the availability of funds, NRCS will provide a supplemental payment to a participant receiving annual payments, who also agrees to adopt or improve a resource-conserving crop rotation or adopt advanced grazing management, as defined by NRCS, to achieve beneficial crop or grazing rotations as appropriate for the eligible land of the participant.

        (1) NRCS will determine whether a resource-conserving crop rotation or advanced grazing management is eligible for supplemental payments based on whether the resource-conserving crop rotation or advanced grazing management is designed to provide natural resource conservation and production benefits;

        (2) A participant must adopt or improve the resource-conserving crop rotation or adopt advanced grazing management during the term of the contract to be eligible to receive a supplemental payment;

        (3) Supplemental payments will be based, to the maximum extent practicable, on the factors from paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and

        (4) Supplemental payments will be not less than 150 percent of the annual payment amount, as determined by NRCS.

        (c)  Participants choosing to develop a comprehensive conservation plan through their conservation stewardship contract will receive a one-time payment for this activity. NRCS will determine the payment based on the number of priority resource concerns addressed in the comprehensive conservation plan and the number of types of land uses included in the plan. Participants will not be eligible to receive payment for plans developed prior to their enrollment in a conservation stewardship contract.

        (d)  NRCS may make a minimum contract payment to a participant in any fiscal year in which the contract's payment amount total is less than a rate determined equitable by the Chief based upon the effort required by a participant to comply with the terms of the contract.

        (e)  NRCS will make payments as soon as practicable after October 1 of each fiscal year for activities carried out in the previous fiscal year. For newly enrolled contracts, NRCS will make payments as soon as practicable after October 1 following the fiscal year of enrollment.

        (f)  NRCS will not provide a CSP payment to a participant for—

        (1) New conservation activities applied with financial assistance through other USDA conservation programs;

        (2) The design, construction, or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment facilities, or associated waste transport or transfer devices for animal feeding operations;

        (3) Conservation activities for which there is no cost incurred or income foregone by the participant; or

        (4) New conservation activities initiated or implemented prior to contract approval, unless NRCS granted a waiver prior to the participant starting the activity.

        (g)  A person or legal entity may not receive, directly or indirectly, payments that, in the aggregate, exceed $200,000 under all CSP contracts entered into during fiscal years 2019 through 2023, excluding funding arrangements with Indian Tribes, regardless of the number of contracts entered into under the CSP by the person or legal entity.

        (h)  Each conservation stewardship contract will be limited to $200,000 over the term of the contract period, except that conservation stewardship contracts with any joint operation will be limited to $400,000 over the term of the contract period.

        (i)  Contracts with Indian Tribes are not subject to payment or contract limitations but payment limitations in paragraph (f) of this section apply to individual Tribal member(s). Indian Tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs will certify in writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive more than the payment limitation. Certification provided at the time of enrollment will cover the entire contract period. The Tribal entity must also provide, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations.

        (j)  To be eligible to receive a CSP payment, all applicants must provide a tax identification number. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, applicants who participate as a legal entity or joint operation must provide a list of all members of the legal entity or joint operation and associated embedded entities, along with the members' Social Security numbers and percentage interest in the legal entity or joint operation. NRCS attributes payments directly to legal entity members for the purpose of complying with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (k)  American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment. Any participant that uses a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax identification number will use that identifier for all CSP contracts in which they participate.

        § 1470.25   Contract modifications and transfers of land.

#### § § 1470.25

        (a) NRCS may modify a conservation stewardship contract, if—

        (1) The participant agrees to the modification; and

        (2) NRCS determines the modification is in the public interest.

        (b) NRCS may allow modification to a conservation stewardship contract to accommodate certain changes in the agricultural operation, including—

        (1) Removing contract acres the participant will enroll in CRP, protect with a wetland reserve easement through the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), or enroll in other Federal or State programs that offer greater natural resource protection through an easement, long-term contract, land use restrictions, or similar authority as determined by NRCS. NRCS may reduce payments for such modified contracts to reflect the modified acreage and performance. Participants will not be subject to liquidated damages or refund of payments received for enrolling land in these programs.

        (2) Accommodating other limited changes, in response to a participant's request made prior to implementing the change, that would take land out of production or convert an area under contract to a different land use. These situations apply only to land for which the participant has and will retain effective control, and not for situations of involuntary loss of land.

        (3) Allowing a participant to substitute a conservation activity as long as the level of conservation performance agreed to at the time of enrollment remains the same or is improved with implementation of the substitute activity.

        (i) Adjustments to existing activities may occur consistent with conservation performance requirements from § 1470.23.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (4) Prior to approval, NRCS must determine that any modification under this section is authorized by the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 3838d-3838g.

        (c) A contract modification under this section will not increase the scheduled annual payments under the program, except to make minor adjustments to a conservation activity, as determined by NRCS; implement an appeal determination; correct an administrative error as approved by NRCS; or to adjust payment limitations. Contracts transferred from an individual or entity to a joint operation will retain the original contract limit outlined in § 1470.24(h).

        (d) Within the time specified in the contract, a participant must provide NRCS with written notice regarding any voluntary or involuntary loss of control of any acreage under the CSP contract, which includes changes in a participant's ownership structure or corporate form. Failure to provide timely notice may result in termination of the entire contract.

        (e) Unless NRCS approves a transfer of contract rights under this paragraph (e), a participant losing control of any acreage may constitute a violation of the CSP contract and NRCS may terminate the contract and require a participant to refund all or a portion of any financial assistance provided. NRCS may approve a transfer of the contract if—

        (1) NRCS receives written notice that identifies the new producer who will take control of the acreage, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;

        (2) The new producer meets program eligibility requirements within a reasonable time frame, as specified in the CSP contract;

        (3) The new producer agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities for the acreage under the contract; and

        (4) NRCS determines that the purposes of the program will continue to be met despite the original participant's losing control of all or a portion of the land under contract.

        (f) Until NRCS approves the transfer of contract rights, the new producer is not a participant in the program and may not receive payment for conservation activities commenced prior to approval of the contract transfer.

        (g) NRCS may not approve a contract transfer and may terminate the contract in its entirety if NRCS determines that the loss of control of the land was voluntary, the new producer is not eligible or willing to assume responsibilities under the contract, or the purposes of the program cannot be met.

        (h) In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, NRCS may, as identified in the CSP contract—

        (i) Terminate the contract;

        (ii) Make any payments due under this part pursuant to guidance under applicable provisions of 7 CFR parts 707 and 1400 (including payment to successor(s)); or

        (iii) Take any further action that the Chief determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

        § 1470.26   Contract renewal.

#### § § 1470.26

        (a) During the first half of the fifth year of the initial contract period, NRCS may allow a participant to apply and compete for the opportunity under §  1470.20 to renew the contract to receive payments for an additional 5-year period, subject to the availability of funds, if the participant meets criteria from paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) To be considered for contract renewal, the participant must—

        (1) Be in compliance with the terms of their existing contract as determined by NRCS;

        (2) Add any newly acquired eligible land that is part of the agricultural operation that NRCS determines must be included in the renewal contract;

        (3) Agree to adopt and continue to integrate new or improved conservation activities across the entire agricultural operation, demonstrating continued improvement during the additional 5-year period, as determined by NRCS; and

        (4) By the end of the renewal contract period, agree to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold of at least two additional priority resource concerns on the agricultural operation; or to adopt or improve conservation activities, as determined by NRCS, to achieve higher levels of conservation performance with respect to not less than two existing priority resource concerns that are specified by the Chief in the initial contract.

        (c) NRCS will determine a participant ineligible for a new CSP contract on an agricultural operation for 2 years following expiration of their prior contract if the participant does not enter a renewal contract on the agricultural operation at the end of the prior contract period.

        § 1470.27   Contract violations and termination.

#### § § 1470.27

        (a) NRCS may terminate a contract:

        (1) Without the consent of the participant where NRCS determines that the participant—

        (i) Violated the contract; or

        (ii) Is unable to comply with the terms of the contract as the result of conditions beyond their control.

        (2) With the consent of the participant if NRCS determines that the termination is in the public interest. NRCS will not assess liquidated damages for contracts terminated under this basis.

        (b) When NRCS terminates a contract in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS may allow a participant to retain payments already received based on—

        (1) The level of effort the participant has made to comply with the contract. NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation activity has achieved the expected conservation performance improvement, is not adversely affected by any contract violation or the absence of other conservation activities that would have been installed under the contract, and has met the associated operation and maintenance requirement of the activity; or

        (2) Hardship situations where circumstances beyond the participant's control prevented the participant from complying with the contract. Any hardship affecting the participant's ability to comply with the contract must not have existed at the time the contract was executed by the participant. Participants may submit a written request to NRCS, along with additional supporting documentation, for NRCS to consider granting a waiver of any requested repayment and/or assessment of liquidated damages.

        (c) If NRCS determines that a participant is out of compliance with the contract terms or incorporated documents, NRCS will notify the participant to explain what the participant must do to regain compliance and the consequences for not correcting the violation. NRCS will give the participant reasonable time to complete all necessary corrective actions, not to exceed one year. NRCS may authorize additional time for the participant to complete the corrective actions if, during the initial period, the participant was unable to complete the corrective actions due to circumstances beyond their control. If a participant's contract continues in violation, NRCS may:

        (1) Terminate the contract in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or

        (2) Where NRCS determines the violation does not warrant termination, NRCS may require the participant to:

        (i) Refund all or a portion of the payments provided; or

        (ii) Agree to such adjustments to the contact terms as determined appropriate by NRCS.

        (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, NRCS will terminate a contract, effective immediately, upon a determination by NRCS that the participant:

        (1) Has submitted false information or filed a false claim;

        (2) Engaged in any act, scheme, or device for which NRCS found the participant ineligible for payments as provided in § 1470.36; or

        (3) Incurred a contract violation that the participant cannot correct in a timeframe established by NRCS.

        (e) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit all rights to future payments under the contract, pay liquidated damages, and refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest, except as otherwise noted in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 1470.28   Grassland conservation initiative contracts.

#### § § 1470.28

        (a) The purpose of the grassland conservation initiative (GCI) is to assist producers in protecting grazing uses, conserving and improving soil, water, and wildlife resources, and achieving related conservation values by conserving eligible land through grassland conservation contracts.

        (b) The GCI is applicable on eligible cropland for which base acres have been maintained by the FSA under section 1112(d)(3) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9012(d)(3)).

        § 1470.36   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 1470.36

        (a) If NRCS determines that an applicant intentionally misrepresented any fact affecting a CSP determination, the application will be determined ineligible immediately.

        (b) A participant who is determined to have erroneously represented any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part will not be entitled to contract payments and must refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 7 CFR part 1403.

        (c) A participant will refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with 7 CFR part 1403, received by such participant with respect to all CSP contracts if they are determined to have—

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation;

        (3) Adopted any scheme or device for the purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which such person would otherwise be entitled under the program; or

        (a) NRCS will not prohibit a participant under this part from participating in, and receiving compensation from, an environmental services market if one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with CSP purposes, as determined by NRCS. CSP participation may create environmental benefits that qualify for environmental credits under an environmental credit-trading program. NRCS will not prohibit a participant under this part from participating in, or receiving compensation from, an environmental credit-trading program, and NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits. However, in addition, any requirements or standards of an environmental market program in which a CSP participant simultaneously enrolls to receive environmental credits must be compatible with the purposes and requirements of the CSP contract and with this part. NRCS retains the authority to ensure that CSP purposes are met and that one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with CSP purposes.

        (b) The participant must meet all operation and maintenance requirements for CSP-funded activities, consistent with §§ 1470.21 and 1470.23. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect the land and conservation activities under a CSP contract, NRCS recommends that CSP participants request assistance with the development of a compatibility assessment prior to entering into any credit agreement. The CSP contract may be modified in accordance with policies outlined in § 1470.25 provided the modifications meet CSP purposes and is in compliance with this part.

        (c) CSP participants may not use CSP funds to implement conservation practices and activities that the participant is required to establish because of a court order.

  SUBCHAPTER C—EXPORT PROGRAMS

## Subchapter C

    PART 1484—PROGRAMS TO HELP DEVELOP FOREIGN MARKETS FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES

### Part 1484

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5623, 5662-5663.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 1484.10   General purpose and scope.

#### § § 1484.10

        (a) This part sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Foreign Market Development (FMD) Cooperator program.

        (b)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards” in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

        (2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this subpart, applies to the Cooperator program.

        (3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the Cooperator program, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the Cooperator program.

        (c) Under the Cooperator program, CCC enters into agreements with eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and promotion activities that are intended to create, maintain, or expand foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC generally gives priority to organizations that are nationwide in membership and scope and have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. Agreements involve the promotion of agricultural commodities on a generic basis. CCC does not provide brand promotion assistance to Cooperators under this program. Agreements may not involve activities targeted directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals. Activities must contribute to the creation, maintenance, or growth of demand for U.S. agricultural commodities and must generally address long-term foreign import constraints and export growth opportunities by focusing on matters such as reducing infrastructural or historical market impediments, improving processing capabilities, modifying codes and standards, and identifying new markets or new applications or uses for the agricultural commodity in the foreign market.

        (d) The Cooperator program generally operates on a reimbursement basis.

        (e) CCC policy is to ensure that benefits generated by Cooperator agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from program activities. CCC also endeavors to enter into Cooperator agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The Cooperator program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) on behalf of CCC.

        (f) The paperwork and recordkeeping requirements imposed by this part have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has assigned control number 0551-0026 for this information collection.

        § 1484.11   Definitions.

#### § § 1484.11

        For purposes of this part the following definitions apply:

        means a specific foreign market development effort undertaken by a Cooperator to address a constraint or opportunity.

        means expenses or costs of administering, directing, and controlling an organization that is a Cooperator. Generally, this would include expenses or costs such as those related to:

        (1) Maintaining a physical office (including, but not limited to: Rent, office equipment, office supplies, office décor, office furniture, computer hardware and software, maintenance, extermination, parking, and business cards);

        (2) Personnel (including, but not limited to: Salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, individual insurance, and training);

        (3) Communications (including, but not limited to: Phone expenses, internet, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, email, mobile email devices, postage, courier services, television, radio, and walkie talkies);

        (4) Management of an organization or unit of an organization (including, but not limited to: Planning, supervision, supervisory travel, teambuilding, recruiting, and hiring);

        (5) Utilities (including, but not limited to: Sewer, water, and energy); and

        (6) Professional services (including, but not limited to: Accounting expenses, financial services, and investigatory services).

        means any partnership, association, company, corporation, trust, or any other such party in which the Cooperator has an investment, other than a mutual fund.

        means a document entered into between CCC and a Cooperator setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under the Cooperator program, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.

        means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its FMD application for a program year has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement. This letter requires a countersignature by the Cooperator before it becomes effective.

        means the FAS employee representing USDA interests in the foreign country in which promotional activities are conducted.

        means a condition in a particular country or region that needs to be addressed in order to develop, expand, or maintain exports of a specific eligible commodity.

        means activities that are designed to directly influence consumers by changing attitudes or purchasing behaviors towards eligible commodities and that involve activities targeted directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals.

        means a nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization that has entered into a foreign market development agreement with CCC.

        means the Foreign Market Development _Cooperator program_.

        means the funds,  money, personnel, materials, services, facilities, or supplies, provided by an FMD Cooperator, State agency, or entities in the FMD Cooperator's industry (“U.S. industry”) in support of an approved activity as well as funds provided by the FMD Cooperator, U.S. industry, or State agency in support of related promotion activities in the markets covered by the FMD Cooperator's agreement.

        means a commercial document, also known as a credit memorandum, issued by the Cooperator to a commercial entity that owes the Cooperator a certain sum. A credit memo is used when the Cooperator owes the commercial entity a sum less than the amount the entity owes the Cooperator. The credit memo reflects an offset of the amount the Cooperator owes the entity against the amount the entity owes to the Cooperator.

        means activities involving the erection or construction of a structure or facility or the installation of equipment.

        means any agricultural commodity or product thereof, excluding tobacco, that is comprised of at least 50 percent by weight, exclusive of added water, of agricultural commodities grown or raised in the United States.

        means a foreign entity that a Cooperator works with, in accordance with this part, to promote the export of an eligible commodity under the Cooperator program.

        means a promotion that does not involve the exclusive or predominant use of a single company name, logo, or brand name, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, but rather promotes an eligible commodity generally. A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand ( a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market an agricultural commodity in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the Cooperator must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme ( a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.

        means a country or region targeted by an activity.

        means a document from the Cooperator by which the Cooperator proposes to CCC changes to the activities and/or funding levels in an approved agreement and/or approval letter.

        means the funds made available to a Cooperator under an agreement and authorized for expenditure in accordance with this part.

        means documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These notices are currently made available electronically through the FAS website. These notices have no legal effect. They are intended to alert Cooperators of various aspects of CCC's current administration of the FMD program. For example, CCC issues notices to alert Cooperators of applicable Federal pay scale rates and lists of economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries.

        means, unless otherwise agreed to in writing between CCC and a Cooperator, a 12-month period during which a Cooperator can undertake activities consistent with this part and its agreement and approval letter with CCC. This is also known as a project period, which in multiple year awards will be divided into budget periods.

        means expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares, and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.

        means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to promote the interests of an entire agricultural sector rather than to result in specific sales by any of its members.

        means a holistic marketing plan that outlines an applicant's proposed foreign market development activities and requested funding under each of the FAS market development programs.

        means an online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants may apply to the Cooperator program and other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at  FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to the FMD program and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).

        means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.

        § 1484.12   Participation eligibility.

#### § § 1484.12

        (a) To participate in the Cooperator program, an entity must be a nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization that promotes the exports of one or more U.S. agricultural commodities, does not have a business interest in or receive remuneration from specific sales of agricultural commodities, and contributes at least 50 percent of the value of resources reimbursed by CCC for activities conducted under the agreement.

        (b) CCC may require that an agreement include a contribution level greater than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In requiring a higher contribution level, CCC will take into account such factors as past Cooperator contribution level, previous Cooperator program funding levels, the length of time an entity participates in the program, and the entity's ability to increase its contribution level.

        (c) CCC will enter into agreements only for the promotion of eligible commodities.

        (a)  CCC will periodically announce through a NOFO that it is accepting applications for participation in the Cooperator program for a specified program year. This announcement will be posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system but are not required to do so.

        (b)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the Cooperator program and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:

        (1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

        (2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and

        (3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.

        (c)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the Cooperator program and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive Cooperator program funding.

        § 1484.21   Application review and formation of agreements.

#### § § 1484.21

        (a)  CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, approve those applications that it considers to present the best opportunity for creating, maintaining, or expanding export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC may weigh which organizations have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.

        (b)  CCC follows results-oriented management principles and considers the following criteria when assessing the likelihood of success of the applications it receives, determining which applications to recommend for approval, and developing preliminary recommended funding levels:

        (1) Strategic planning (25%);

        (2) Program implementation (25%); and

        (3) Program results and evaluation (50%).

        § 1484.22   Allocation factors.

#### § § 1484.22

        CCC determines final funding levels after allocating available funds to approved applications on the basis of criteria that will be fully described in each program year's Cooperator program announcement. Generally, extensions will not be allowable.

      Subpart C—Program Operations

        § 1484.30   Approval decision.

#### § § 1484.30

        CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send an agreement, an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The agreement and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a Cooperator's program, including the required level of Cooperator contribution and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and approval letter must so indicate by having its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or designee sign the agreement and approval letter and submit them to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the agreement and approval letter are signed by both parties. The agreement, the approval letter, and this part shall establish the terms and conditions of a Cooperator agreement between CCC and the approved applicant. CCC will provide each Cooperator with IDs and passwords for the UES, as necessary. Cooperators shall protect these IDs and passwords in accordance with USDA's information technology policies. Cooperators shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information or a person who is not authorized gains such information.

        § 1484.31   Signature cards.

#### § § 1484.31

        The Cooperator shall designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The Cooperator shall submit the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the Cooperator's CEO to CCC prior to the start of the program year. The Cooperator shall immediately notify CCC of any changes in signatories ( removal or addition of individuals, name changes, etc.), and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.

        § 1484.32   Employment practices.

#### § § 1484.32

        (e) A Cooperator shall also maintain adequate documentation related to the proper disposition of all personal property having a useful life of over one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Cooperator and for which the Cooperator is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with project funds.

        (f) A Cooperator shall maintain its records of expenditures and contribution in a manner that allows it to provide information by program year, country or region, activity number, and cost category (as applicable). Such records shall include copies of:

        (1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);

        (2) Receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a minimum level that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all Cooperators via a program notice issued on the FAS website. Receipts for all actual meal and incidental expenses (M&IE) reimbursements must be maintained, regardless of the amount;

        (3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of each expenditure made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;

        (4) Reimbursement claims;

        (C) If neither of the foregoing is available, a statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what goods and services it provided; or

        (D) If none of the foregoing are available, a memo to the files of the Cooperator's estimate of what contribution was made by the U.S. industry or State agency, item by item, and the method used to assign a value to each.

        (ii) Documentation supporting contribution must include the date(s), purpose, and location(s) of each activity for which cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution; who conducted the activity; the participating groups or individuals; and the method of computing the claimed contribution. Cooperators must retain and make available for compliance reviews and audits documentation related to claimed contribution.

        (g) Upon request, a Cooperator shall provide to CCC copies of the documents that support the Cooperator's reimbursement claims. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by adequate documentation.

        § 1484.34   Ethical conduct.

#### § § 1484.34

        (a) A Cooperator shall conduct its business in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country(s) in which each activity is carried out and in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. A Cooperator shall conduct its business in the United States in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

        (b) Neither a Cooperator nor its affiliates shall make export sales of eligible commodities covered under the terms of an agreement. Neither a Cooperator nor its affiliates shall charge a fee for facilitating an export sale. A Cooperator may collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the Cooperator's organization.

        (c) The Cooperator shall not use program activities or project funds to promote private self-interests or conduct private business, except as members of trade teams.

        (d) A Cooperator shall not limit participation in its FMD activities to members of its organization. Cooperators shall ensure that their FMD-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors.

        (e) A Cooperator shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in activities such as trade teams or trade fairs based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by CCC, a Cooperator shall submit such selection criteria to CCC for approval.

        (f) All Cooperators should endeavor to ensure fair and accurate fact-based advertising. Deceptive or misleading promotions may result in cancellation or termination of an agreement and recovery of CCC funds related to such promotions from the Cooperator.

        (g) The Cooperator must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of program activities to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and the Cooperator's U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to CCC.

        § 1484.35   Contracting procedures.

#### § § 1484.35

        (a) Cooperators have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all contracts and assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on contracts entered into by the Cooperator. Neither CCC nor any other agency of the United States Government nor any official or employee of CCC, FAS, USDA, or the United States Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to Cooperator contracts with third parties.

        (b) Cooperators are responsible for ensuring to the greatest extent possible that the terms, conditions, and costs of contracts constitute the most economical and effective use of project funds.

        (c) All fees for professional and technical services paid in any part with project funds must be covered by written contracts.

        (d) A Cooperator shall:

        (1) Ensure that no employee, officer, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, or agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated in this paragraph (d)(1) participates in the review, selection, award, or administration of a contract in which such entities or their affiliates have a financial or other interest;

        (2) Conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement;

        (3) Base each solicitation for professional or technical services on a clear and accurate description of and requirements related to the services to be procured;

        (4) Perform and document some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices for procurements in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold in 2 CFR 200.88; and

        (5) Document the decision-making process.

        § 1484.36   Property.

#### § § 1484.36

        (a) A Cooperator shall maintain an inventory of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more that was acquired in furtherance of program activities. The inventory shall list and number each item and include the date of purchase or acquisition, cost of purchase, replacement value, serial number, make, model, and electrical requirements, as applicable.

        (b) The Cooperator shall insure all real property and equipment that was acquired, in whole or in part, with project funds at a level minimally equal to the equivalent insurance coverage for property owned by the Cooperator. The Cooperator shall safeguard such property and equipment against theft, damage, and unauthorized use. The Cooperator shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of such property and equipment to the insurance company.

        (c) Personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Cooperator, and for which the Cooperator is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with project funds, that is unusable, unserviceable, or no longer needed for project purposes shall be disposed of in one of the following ways. The Cooperator may:

        (1) Exchange or sell the property, provided that it applies any exchange allowance, insurance proceeds, or sales proceeds toward the purchase of other property needed in the project;

        (2) With CCC approval, transfer the property to other Cooperators for their activities, or to a foreign subrecipient; or

        (3) Upon Attaché/Counselor approval, donate the property to a local charity, or convey the property to the Attaché/Counselor, along with an itemized inventory list and any documents of title.

        (d) The Cooperator is responsible for reimbursing CCC for the value of any uninsured property at the time of the loss or theft of the property.

        § 1484.37   Federal Travel Regulations.

#### § § 1484.37

        Except as otherwise provided in this part, travel funded by the Cooperator program shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and FMD-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The Cooperator shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.

        § 1484.38   Program income.

#### § § 1484.38

        Program income is gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with FMD funds, shall be used by the FMD Cooperator in furtherance of its approved FMD activities in the program year during which the FMD funds are available for obligation by the FMD Cooperator, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this subpart. Interest earned on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for approved activities. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to FAS. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as contribution.

        § 1484.39   Changes to activities and funding.

#### § § 1484.39

        (a)  (1) A Cooperator may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the Cooperator shall submit a notification to CCC.

        (2) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description, the proposed budget, and a justification for the transfer of funds.

        (3) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the Cooperator via the UES system whether the requested budget is approved.

        (b)  (1) A Cooperator desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.

        (2) A Cooperator may make significant adjustments below the threshold in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 calendar days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.

        (3) Notifications shall describe the activity and any changes to the activity, the existing funding level, or the proposed funding level and shall include a justification for the transfer of funds, if applicable.

      Subpart D—Contribution and Reimbursements

        § 1484.50   Contribution rules.

#### § § 1484.50

Where the Cooperator uses its own funds to pay for administrative costs, such costs may be counted in calculating the amount of contribution the Cooperator contributes to its FMD program. The contribution amount will be reflected in the award budget.

        (b) In calculating the amount of contribution that it will make and the contribution that a U.S. industry or a State or local agency will make, a Cooperator program applicant may include the costs (or such prorated costs) listed under paragraph (c) of this section if:

        (1) Expenditures are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the Cooperator's overall foreign market development program;

        (2) Expenditures are not included as cost share for any other Federal award;

        § 1484.52   Reimbursement rules.

#### § § 1484.52

        (a) A Cooperator may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

        (1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and

        (2) The Cooperator has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

        (b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and § 1484.53, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

        (6) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, non-travel expenditures, including participation fees, booth construction, transportation of related materials, rental of space and equipment, and duplication of related printed materials, associated with retail and trade exhibits and shows, whether held outside or inside the United States. However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

        (i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

        (ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

        (7) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail or trade exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, project funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those Cooperators located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(7), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the Cooperator in writing;

        (8) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States, including space rental, equipment rental, and duplication of seminar materials;

        (ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the target audience purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;

        (12) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to U.S. citizen employees or U.S. citizen contractors stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, subject to the limitation that CCC shall not reimburse that portion of:

Generally, CCC will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employee's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee works. However, if the local FSN salary plan is inappropriate, a Cooperator may request a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen in accordance with the annual program announcement;

        (15) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process revels that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

        (16) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;

        (17) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;

        (18) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved FMD-funded overseas offices;

        (19) Fees for professional and consultant services;

        (20) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail or trade exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are: A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, and an international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

        (i) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim;

        (ii) In very limited circumstances, the Cooperator may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate ( a premium class rate other than the first-class rate). Such circumstances are:

        (A) Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the Cooperator receives written documentation to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;

        (B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; or

        (C) An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time and ending with the scheduled arrival time, including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days ( weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel; and

        (iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses;

        (21) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate, or rental cars while in travel status;

        (22) Subject to § 1484.37 and paragraph (b)(7) of this section, other allowable expenditures while in travel status;

        (23) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the Cooperator's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office;

        (24) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as furniture, equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, draperies, blinds, floor coverings, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones, wireless email devices, and personal digital assistants);

        (25) Premiums for health or accident insurance or other benefits for foreign national employees that the employer is required by law to pay, provided that such benefits are granted under established written policies;

        (26) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third party participants for Cooperator program activities, or such insurance premiums for Cooperator program-funded travel of non-Cooperator personnel, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the Cooperator's policy and sound business practice;

        (27) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;

        (28) Independent evaluations and audits, if not otherwise required by CCC, to ensure compliance with program requirements;

        (29) Legal fees to obtain advice on the host country's labor laws;

        (30) Employment agency fees;

        (31) STRE incurred outside of the United States, and STRE incurred in conjunction with an approved activity taking place within the United States with prior written approval from CCC. Cooperators are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and receptions. Cooperators may exceed Embassy guidelines only when they have received written authorization from the FAS Attaché/Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. Cooperators must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. For STRE incurred in the United States, the Cooperator should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;

        (32) Travel costs for dependents as allowed in 2 CFR part 200 ( for travel of duration of six months or more with prior approval of CCC);

        (33) Evacuation payments (safe haven) and shipment and storage of household goods and motor vehicles for relocations lasting at least 12 months;

        (34) Approved demonstration projects;

        (35) Purchase of trade and business periodicals containing material related to market development activities for use by overseas staffs;

        (36) Training expenses in the United States for FSNs;

        (37) Language training for U.S. citizen employees at the foreign post of assignment;

        (38) Forward year financial obligations required by local law or custom, such as severance pay, attributable to employment of foreign nationals, or forfeiture of rent or deposits, attributable to the closure of an office;

        (39) Rental or lease expenditures for storage space for program-related materials;

        (40) Shipment of samples or other program materials;

        (41) That portion of airtime for wireless phones that is devoted to program activities and monthly service fees prorated at the proportion of program-related airtime to total airtime;

        (42) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;

        (43) An audit of a Cooperator as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, if the Cooperator program is the Cooperator's largest source of Federal funding;

        (44) The translation of written materials as necessary to carry out approved activities;

        (45) Business cards that target a foreign audience;

        (46) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that: Contain a message related to exporting or international trade, include a discernible “link” to the FAS/Washington homepage or an FAS overseas homepage, and have been specifically approved by FAS. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for websites that include any sort of “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access;

        (47) Expenditures related to copyright, trademark, or patent registration, including attorney fees;

        (48) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending technical barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities;

        (49) Membership fees in professional, industry-related organizations; and

        (50) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a Cooperator is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience ( a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the Cooperator's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Cooperator, whether for the Cooperator's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.

        (26) Refreshments, or related equipment, for office staff;

        (27) Insurance on household goods and personal effects, including privately-owned automobiles, whether overseas or stored in the United States, belonging to U.S. citizen employees;

        (2) The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and

        (3) All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.

        (d) A Cooperator shall not use project funds for any activity, or any expenses incurred by the Cooperator prior to the date specified in the approval letter or after the date the agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.

        § 1484.54   Reimbursement procedures.

#### § § 1484.54

        (a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Cooperator may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing FMD activities, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Cooperator will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.

        (b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the FMD Cooperator's U.S. office to CCC. CCC will make all payments to Cooperators in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

        (c) Cooperators will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursement or advance at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

        (d) CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the end of an FMD Cooperator's program year.

        (e) If CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, the FMD Cooperator shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The FMD Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (f) If a Cooperator receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment which is later disallowed, the Cooperator shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (g) FMD funds may be expended by FMD Cooperators only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the agreement and approval letter. If a Cooperator discovers that FMD funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The FMD Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (h) The FMD Cooperator shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and its U.S. office shall report such actions in writing to the appropriate FAS Division Director.

        § 1484.55   Advances.

#### § § 1484.55

        (a)  In general, CCC operates the Cooperator program on a reimbursable basis.

        (b)  Upon request, CCC may make two types of advance payments to a Cooperator. The first is a revolving fund operating advance provided by CCC only to Cooperators with foreign offices supported with project funds. The second is a special advance payment used to pay an impending large cost item. CCC will provide this type of advance expense payment in lieu of direct payments by CCC to vendors or other third parties. All Cooperators, with or without project fund-supported foreign offices, are eligible to request special advance payments. CCC will not make any special advance payment to a Cooperator where a special advance is outstanding from a prior program year. When approving a request for an advance, CCC may require the Cooperator to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the Cooperator program. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, the Cooperator's history of performance in the Cooperator program, the Cooperator's perceived financial stability and resources, and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Cooperator's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.

        (c)  A Cooperator shall deposit and maintain in an insured account in the United States all funds advanced by CCC. The account shall be interest-bearing, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Cooperator on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Cooperator for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.

        (d)  A Cooperator shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of the 90 calendar days, the Cooperator must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

      Subpart E—Reporting, Evaluation, and Compliance

        § 1484.70   Reports.

#### § § 1484.70

        (a) Cooperators are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for the required financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Cooperator.

        (b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.329(c)(2), a Cooperator's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Cooperator's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Cooperator must provide an explanation in the report.

        (2) A Cooperator must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Cooperator's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Cooperator must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.

        (c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.

        (d) Not later than 45 calendar days after the completion of travel (other than local travel), a Cooperator shall submit a trip report. The report must be submitted to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor(s) and must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.

        (e) Not later than 90 calendar days after the end of its program year, a Cooperator shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved FMD program.

        (f) If requested by FAS, a Cooperator must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.

        (g) If a Cooperator requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.

        § 1484.71   Disclosure of program information.

#### § § 1484.71

        (a) Documents submitted to CCC by Cooperators are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, and, specifically, 7 CFR 1.12.

        (b) Upon request, a Cooperator shall provide to any person a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information that is developed and produced under the terms of its agreement. The Cooperator may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials.

        (c) Any research conducted by a Cooperator pursuant to an agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.

        § 1484.72   Evaluation.

#### § § 1484.72

        (a) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306, 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the Cooperator program. Evaluation of the Cooperator program's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by each Cooperator of the constraints and opportunities facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, a schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, a plan for achievement, and reports of activity results at regular intervals. The overall goal of Cooperators' programming is to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the absence of FMD funding. A Cooperator that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Cooperator's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.

        (b) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a Cooperator's program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of program effectiveness.

        (c) When required by CCC, a Cooperator shall complete a program evaluation.  A program evaluation is a review of the Cooperator's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the Cooperator and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the Cooperator's strategy in meeting specified goals. The actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the Cooperator and CCC and specified in the Cooperator's approval letter. A Cooperator may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy this requirement, although CCC reserves the right to have direct input and control over the design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the independent evaluator. In addition to the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, a program evaluation shall contain:

        (1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;

        (2) The activities covered by the evaluation;

        (3) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and opportunities and the goals specified in the approved agreement;

        (4) A description of the evaluation methodology;

        (5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the ratio of additional export sales in relation to Cooperator program funding received;

        (6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and

        (7) Recommendations for future programs.

        (d) A Cooperator shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.

        (e) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by CCC, a Cooperator shall complete and submit program success stories. CCC will announce to all Cooperators the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.

        § 1484.73   Failure to make required contribution.

#### § § 1484.73

        A Cooperator's required contribution will be specified in the Cooperator's approval letter. If a Cooperator fails to contribute the amount specified in its approval letter, the Cooperator shall pay to CCC in U.S. dollars the difference between the amount it has contributed, and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the Cooperator's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the Cooperator may either return to CCC the necessary amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A Cooperator shall remit such payment within six months after the end of its program year. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        § 1484.74   Compliance reviews and notices.

#### § § 1484.74

        (a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of a Cooperator's activities under this program to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Cooperators shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.

        (b) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.

        (c) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Cooperator. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Cooperator is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Cooperator. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Cooperator program, CCC may require the Cooperator to contract for an independent audit.

        (d) In addition, CCC may notify a Cooperator in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Cooperator in the written notice. The Cooperator shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Cooperator notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Cooperator intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Cooperator is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.

        (e) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Cooperator is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.

        § 1484.75   Cooperator response to compliance report.

#### § § 1484.75

        (a) A Cooperator shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Cooperator does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

        (b) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Cooperator owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Cooperator in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Cooperator a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.

        § 1484.76   Cooperator appeals of CCC determinations.

#### § § 1484.76

        (a) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Cooperator may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Cooperator may also request a hearing.

        (b) If the Cooperator requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.

        (c) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.

        § 1484.77   Submissions.

#### § § 1484.77

        For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this part shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by CCC.

        § 1484.78   Amendments.

#### § § 1484.78

        An agreement may be amended in writing with the consent of CCC and the Cooperator. All requests for program amendments must be submitted to CCC in writing and contain a justification for why the amendment is necessary. All amendment requests must be reviewed and approved by CCC before an amendment can be issued.

        § 1484.79   Subrecipients.

#### § § 1484.79

        (a) A Cooperator may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Cooperator for this purpose. The Cooperator must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.332 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Cooperator must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.

        (b) A Cooperator must include the following requirements in a subaward:

        (1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.

        (2) The subrecipient must pay to the Cooperator the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

        (3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

        (c) A Cooperator must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.

        § 1484.80   Audit requirements.

#### § § 1484.80

        (a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Cooperators and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.

        (b) A Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Cooperator or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy this requirement:

        (1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Cooperator or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or

        (ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Cooperator or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or

        (2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

        (c) A Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.

        (d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Cooperator or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.

        (e) When a Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.

        (f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Cooperators or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Cooperators and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).

        § 1484.81   Suspension and termination of agreements.

#### § § 1484.81

        (a) An agreement or subaward may be suspended or terminated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340. FAS may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:

        (1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340 for termination or suspension by FAS has been satisfied; or

        (2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable.

        (b) If an agreement is terminated, the Cooperator:

        (1) Is responsible for using or returning any CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed, as agreed to by FAS; and

        (2) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.344 and 200.345.

> [85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68882, Dec. 6, 2021]

        § 1484.82   Noncompliance with an agreement.

#### § § 1484.82

        (a) If a Cooperator fails to comply with any term in its agreement, approval letter, or this part, CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the Cooperator, following the procedures set forth in this part. CCC may also initiate a claim against a Cooperator if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the Cooperator. If any Cooperator has engaged in fraud with respect to the Cooperator program, or has otherwise violated program requirements under this part, CCC may:

        (1) Hold such Cooperator liable for any and all losses to CCC resulting from such fraud or violation;

        (2) Require a refund of any assistance provided to such Cooperator plus interest as determined by FAS; and

        (3) Collect liquidated damages from such Cooperator in an amount determined appropriate by FAS.

        (b) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy that is available under any other provision of law.

    PART 1485—GRANT AGREEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOREIGN MARKETS FOR U.S. AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES

### Part 1485

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5623, 5662-5663

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A [Reserved]

      Subpart B—Market Access Program

        § 1485.10   General purpose and scope.

#### § § 1485.10

        (a) This subpart sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Market Access Program (MAP).

        (b)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

        (2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this subpart, applies to the Market Access Program (MAP) Program.

        (3) In addition to the provisions of this subpart, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the MAP, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the MAP.

        (c) Under the MAP, CCC may provide grants to eligible U.S. entities to conduct certain marketing and promotion activities aimed at developing, maintaining, or expanding commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. MAP Participants may receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities. While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable activities may also take place in the United States. CCC expects all activities that occur in the United States for which MAP reimbursement is sought to develop, maintain, or expand the commercial export market for the relevant U.S. agricultural commodity in accordance with the MAP Participant's approved MAP program.

        (d) The MAP generally operates on a reimbursement basis.

        (e) CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from program activities. CCC also endeavors to enter into MAP agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The MAP is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of CCC.

        § 1485.11   Definitions.

#### § § 1485.11

        For purposes of this subpart the following definitions apply:

        means a specific foreign market development effort undertaken by a MAP Participant.

        means expenses or costs of administering, directing, and controlling an organization that is a MAP Participant. Generally, this would include expenses or costs such as those related to:

        means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its MAP application for a program year has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement. This letter requires a countersignature by the MAP Participant before it becomes effective.

        means the FAS employee representing USDA interests in the foreign country in which promotional activities are conducted.

        means a small-sized U.S. for-profit entity or a U.S. agricultural cooperative that owns the brand(s) of the eligible commodity to be promoted or has the exclusive rights to use such brand(s) and that is participating in the MAP brand promotion program of another MAP Participant. This definition does not include any U.S. agricultural cooperatives that are MAP Participants that apply for MAP funds to implement their own brand programs.

        means an activity that involves the exclusive or predominant use of a single U.S. company name, or the logo or brand name of a single U.S. company, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, or any activity undertaken by a MAP Participant in the brand program.

        means activities involving the erection or construction of a structure or facility or the installation of equipment.

        means any agricultural commodity or product thereof, excluding tobacco, that is comprised of at least 50 percent by weight, exclusive of added water, of agricultural commodities grown or raised in the United States.

        means an activity that is not a brand promotion but, rather, promotes an eligible commodity generally. A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand ( a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market a commodity or product in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity or product from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the MAP Participant must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme ( a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.

        is the acronym for the Market Access Program.

        means an entity that has entered into an agreement with CCC.

        means a country or region targeted by an activity.

        means a representative part of a larger whole promoted commodity or group of promoted commodities. _Product samples_ include all forms of a promoted commodity ( fresh or processed), independent of the ultimate utilization of the sample. Product samples might be used in support of international marketing activities including, but not limited to: Displays, food process testing, cooking demonstrations, or trade and consumer tastings.

        means documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These notices are currently made available electronically through the FAS website. These notices have no legal effect. They are intended to alert MAP Participants of various aspects of CCC's current administration of the MAP program. For example, CCC issues notices to alert Participants of applicable Federal pay scale rates and lists of economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries.

        means, unless otherwise agreed to in writing between CCC and a MAP Participant, a 12-month period during which a MAP Participant can undertake activities consistent with this subpart and its agreement and approval letter with CCC. This is also known as a project period, which in multiple year awards will be divided into budget periods.

        means an eligible commodity the sale of which is the intended result of a promotional activity under the MAP.

        (STRE) means expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares, and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.

        means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to result in specific sales.

        means a U.S. commercial entity that meets the small business size standards published at 13 CFR part 121, Small Business Size Regulations.

        means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to promote the interests of an entire agricultural sector rather than to result in specific sales by any of its members.

        means a holistic marketing plan that outlines an applicant's proposed foreign market development activities and requested funding under each of the FAS market development programs.

        means an online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants may currently apply to the MAP and other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at  FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to MAP and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).

        means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.

        means an organized or incorporated firm, association, or other entity that is located and doing business for profit in the United States and is engaged in the export or sale of an eligible commodity.

        § 1485.12   Participation eligibility.

        (1) A nonprofit U.S agricultural trade organization;

        (2) A nonprofit SRTG;

        (3) A U.S. agricultural cooperative; or

        (4) A State agency.

        (b) CCC will enter into an agreement only for the promotion of an eligible commodity.

        (c) FAS may set forth specific eligibility information, including any factors or priorities that will affect the eligibility of an applicant or application for selection, in the full text of the applicable NOFO posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities.

        § 1485.13   Application process.

#### § § 1485.13

        (a)  CCC will periodically announce through a NOFO that it is accepting applications for participation in the MAP for a specified program year. This announcement will be posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system but are not required to do so. Applicants may apply to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program that provides MAP funds to brand participants for branded promotion. An applicant that is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.

        (b)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the MAP program and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:

        (1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

        (3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.

        (c)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the MAP program and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive MAP funding.

        § 1485.14   Application review and formation of agreements.

#### § § 1485.14

        (a)  (1) CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, approve those applications that it considers to present the best opportunity for developing, maintaining, or expanding export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal.

        (2) When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC may weigh which organizations have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. CCC may require that an applicant participate in the MAP through another MAP Participant or applicant. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.

        (b)  CCC follows results-oriented management principles and considers the following criteria when assessing the likelihood of success of the applications it receives, determining which applications to recommend for approval, and developing preliminary recommended funding levels:

        (1) Strategic planning (25%);

        (2) Program implementation (25%); and

        (3) Program results and evaluation (50%).

        (c)  CCC determines final funding levels after allocating available funds to approved applications on the basis of criteria that will be fully described in each program year's MAP announcement. Generally, extensions will not be allowable.

        (d) —(1)  CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

        (2)  CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send an agreement, an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The agreement and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a MAP Participant's program, including any requirements with respect to contribution, cost share and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and the approval letter must so indicate by having its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or designee sign the agreement and the approval letter and submit these to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the agreement and the approval letter are signed by both parties. The agreement, approval letter, and this subpart shall establish the terms and conditions of a MAP agreement between CCC and the approved applicant.

        (e)  The MAP Participant shall designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The MAP Participant shall submit the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the MAP Participant's CEO to CCC prior to the start of the program year. The Participant shall immediately notify CCC of any changes in signatories ( removal or addition of individuals, name changes, etc.), and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.

        (f)  CCC will provide each MAP Participant with IDs and passwords for the UES system, as necessary. MAP Participants shall protect these IDs and passwords in accordance with USDA's information technology policies. MAP Participants shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information or a person who is not authorized gains such information.

        (g)  A MAP Participant through which small-sized U.S. for-profit entities and/or U.S. agricultural cooperatives are participating in the MAP program shall obtain annual certifications from all such entities that they are small-sized U.S. entities or U.S. agricultural cooperatives as defined in these regulations. The Participant shall retain these certifications in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of this subpart.

        (h) —(1)  (i) A MAP Participant may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the MAP Participant shall submit a notification to CCC.

        (ii) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description, the proposed budget, and a justification for the transfer of funds.

        (iii) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the MAP Participant via the UES system whether the requested budget is approved.

        (2)  (i) A MAP Participant desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.

        (ii) A MAP Participant may make significant adjustments below that threshold to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 calendar days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.

        (iii) Notifications shall describe the activity and any changes to the activity, the existing funding level, or the proposed funding level and shall include a justification for the transfer of funds, if applicable.

        § 1485.15   Operational procedures for brand programs.

#### § § 1485.15

        (a) Where CCC approves an application by a MAP Participant to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the MAP Participant shall establish brand program operational procedures. The MAP Participant annually shall submit to CCC for approval its proposed brand program operational procedures for such program year. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for brand program operation procedures. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, a brand program application, application procedures, application review criteria, brand participant eligibility requirements, a participation agreement, reimbursement requirements, compliance requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, employment practices, financial management requirements, contracting procedures, and evaluation requirements.

        (b) The MAP Participant shall not enter into any participation agreements with brand participants nor shall it implement any MAP brand activities for the applicable program year unless and until CCC has communicated in writing its approval of the proposed operational procedures to the MAP Participant.

        (c) Participation agreements between MAP Participants and brand participants. Where CCC approves a MAP Participant's application to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the MAP Participant shall enter into participation agreements with brand participants. These agreements must:

        (1) Specify a time period for such brand promotion and require that all brand promotion expenditures be made within the MAP Participant's approved program year;

        (2) Make no allowance for extension or renewal;

        (3) Limit reimbursable expenditures to those made in countries and for activities approved in the brand participant's activity plan;

        (4) Specify the percentage of promotion expenditures that will be reimbursed, reimbursement procedures, and documentation requirements;

        (5) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it either owns the brand of the product it will promote or has exclusive rights to promote the brand in each of the countries in which promotion activities will occur;

        (6) Require: That all product labels, promotional material, and advertising will identify the origin of the eligible commodity as “American,” “Product of the United States of America,” “Product of the U.S.,” “Product of the U.S.A.,” “Product of America,” “Grown in the United States of America,” “Grown in the U.S.,” “Grown in the U.S.A.,” “Grown in America,” “Made in the United States of America,” “Made in the U.S.,” “Made in the U.S.A.,” “Made in America,” or product of, grown in, or made in any state or territory of the United States of America spelled out in its entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of   inch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter “o.” The use of these terms as a descriptor or in the name of the product ( Texas style chili, Bob's American Pizza) does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases “product of,” “grown in,” or “made in” are encouraged, but not required. A MAP Participant that wishes to use an origin statement that varies from those set out in this subsection must submit the proposed statement to CCC for review and must receive approval to use the statement before its use in an activity. A MAP Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a case by case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to CCC that this labeling requirement would hinder a MAP Participant's promotional efforts. CCC will determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the labeling requirement. In addition, CCC may temporarily waive this requirement where CCC has determined that such labeling will likely harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be announced to MAP Participants via a program notice issued on FAS' website;

        (7) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it is either a small-sized entity as defined in this subpart or a U.S. agricultural cooperative;

        (8) Require that the brand participant submit to the MAP Participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contribution or cost share to program activities; and

        (9) Require the brand participant to maintain all original records and documents relating to program activities for five calendar years following the end of the applicable program year and make such records and documents available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

        § 1485.17   Reimbursement rules.

#### § § 1485.17

        (a) A MAP Participant may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

        (1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and

        (2) The Participant has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

        (b) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, for either brand or generic promotion activities, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

        (1) Production and placement of advertising, including in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters, which may include advertising the availability of price discounts, except that advertising associated with a coupon or price discount for the MAP-promoted product is not reimbursable. If advertising is related to both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such advertising will not be reimbursed in whole or in part ( expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement). Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, and podcasting;

        (2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and other similar point of sale materials;

        (5) Temporary displays and rental of space for temporary displays;

        (6) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States, including space rental, equipment rental, and duplication of seminar materials;

        (7) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, non-travel expenditures, including participation fees, booth construction, transportation of related materials, rental of space and equipment, and duplication of related printed materials, associated with retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows, whether held outside or inside the United States. However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

        (i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

        (ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

        (8) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures (with airfare limited to the full fare economy rate), including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for no more than two representatives of a single brand participant (or MAP Participant directly running its own brand program) to exhibit their company's (or cooperative's) products at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States.

        (9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the MAP Participant;

        (10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, in-store promotions, food service promotions, and trade seminars;

        (11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts, and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to MAP Participants via a program notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:

        (i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and

        (ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the consumer, or other target audience, purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;

        (12) The design and production of packaging, labeling, or origin identification to be used during the program year in which the expenditure is made, if such packaging, labeling, or origin identification is necessary to meet the importing requirements of a foreign country;

        (13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part ( expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement);

        (14) An audit of a MAP Participant as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F if the MAP is the MAP Participant's largest source of Federal funding;

        (15) The translation of written materials as necessary to carry out approved activities;

        (16) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that clearly target a foreign audience;

        (17) International travel expenditures (with airfare limited to the full fare economy rate), including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), incurred for a foreign trade mission conducted outside the United States that is an activity under an approved branded program and that has met the following conditions:

        (i) Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the MAP Participant's UES;

        (ii) The trade mission included representatives, as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, from a minimum of five different companies (or cooperatives), and no more than two representatives from each participating company (or cooperative);

        (iii) The appropriate FAS overseas office supported the trade mission by dedicating meaningful funding or other resources (such as facilities or staff time) to the activity; and

        (iv)(A) The MAP Participant with the approved brand program produced an itinerary or agenda for the trade mission that demonstrated that company (or cooperative) representatives would be engaged for a minimum of 6 hours per day (except for the first and last days of the mission) in trade mission activities that include, at a minimum, each of the following:

        () A product showcase where the FAS overseas office approved an invitation list of qualified buyers;

        () Pre-arranged one-on-one business meetings; and

        () Evaluation and feedback sessions with FAS staff and trade mission sponsors.

        (B) Reimbursement is conditional on the MAP Participant having notified in writing the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel;

        (18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, MAP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those MAP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(18), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the MAP Participant in writing; and

        (19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a MAP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience ( a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the MAP Participant's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.

        (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, but for generic promotion activities only, CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

        (1) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:

        (i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or

        (ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel.

        (2) Approved Supergrade salaries for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas;

        (3) Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas, subject to the following limitations:

        (i) Where there is a local U.S. Embassy Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan, except for approved Supergrades; or

        (ii) Where an FSN salary plan does not exist, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds locally prevailing levels, which the MAP Participant shall document by a salary survey or other means, except for approved Supergrades;

        (4) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;

        (5) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;

        (6) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved MAP-funded overseas offices;

        (7) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

        (8)(i) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

        (A) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

        (B) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country.

        (ii) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.

        (iii) In very limited circumstances, the MAP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate ( a premium class rate other than the first class rate). Such circumstances are:

        (A) Regularly scheduled flights between the origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the MAP Participant receives written documentation to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;

        (B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; or

        (C) An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time and ending with the scheduled arrival time, including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days ( weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel;

        (iv) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses;

        (9) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;

        (10) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);

        (11) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office;

        (12) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for, capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as furniture, equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, draperies, blinds, floor coverings, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones, wireless email devices, and personal digital assistants);

        (13) Such premiums for health or accident insurance and other benefits for foreign national employees that the employer is required by law to pay, provided that such benefits are granted under established written policies;

        (14) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for MAP activities or for MAP-funded travel of third-party participants, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice;

        (15) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;

        (16) Independent evaluations and audits, if not otherwise required by CCC, to ensure compliance with program requirements;

        (17) Legal fees to obtain advice on the host country's labor laws;

        (18) Employment agency fees;

        (19) STRE incurred outside of the United States, and STRE incurred in conjunction with an approved activity taking place within the United States with prior written approval from CCC. MAP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and receptions. MAP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines only when they have received written authorization from the FAS Attaché/Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. MAP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. For STRE incurred in the United States, the MAP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;

        (20) Evacuation payments (safe haven) and shipment and storage of household goods and motor vehicles for relocations lasting at least 12 months;

        (21) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council;

        (22) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;

        (23) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for international retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:

        (i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

        (ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;

        (24) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States;

        (25) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for one home office MAP Participant employee, one MAP Participant board member, or a state department of agriculture employee paid by the MAP Participant, when such individual accompanies foreign trade missions or technical teams while traveling in the United States where the following conditions are met:

        (i) Such trade missions or technical team visits are identified in the MAP Participant's UES;

        (ii) Such trade missions or technical team visits have been approved by CCC; and

        (iii) The MAP-sponsored traveler submits a follow-up trip report to CCC that includes the following:

        (A) Purpose for the individual's participation;

        (C) Itinerary and/or agenda for the trip; and

        (D) Feedback from sponsors and trade mission/technical team members on the success of the trip.

        (30) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that: Contain a message related to exporting or international trade, include a discernible “link” to the FAS/Washington homepage or an FAS overseas homepage, and have been specifically approved by FAS. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for websites that include any sort of “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access;

        (31) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending technical barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities;

        (8) Rental, lease, or purchase of warehouse space, except for storage space for program-related material;

        (9) Coupon redemption or price discounts of the promoted commodity;

        (10) Refundable deposits or advances;

        (13) The purchase, lease (except for use in authorized travel status), or repair of motor vehicles;

        (14) Travel of applicants for employment interviews;

        (15) Unused non-refundable airline tickets or associated penalty fees, except where travel was restricted by U.S. Government action or advisory;

        (16) Independent evaluations or audits, including evaluations or audits of the activities of a subcontractor, if CCC determines that such a review is needed in order to confirm past or to ensure future agreement or regulatory compliance;

        (17) Any arrangement that has the effect of reducing the selling price of an agricultural commodity;

        (18) Goods, services, and salaries of personnel provided by a third party;

        (19) Membership fees in clubs and social organizations;

        (20) Indemnity and fidelity bonds, except as otherwise allowed in 2 CFR part 200;

        (21) Fees for participating in U.S. Government sponsored activities, other than trade fairs, shows, and exhibits;

        (23) Seasonal greeting cards;

        (24) Office parking fees;

        (25) Subscriptions to publications that are not of a technical, economic, or marketing nature or that are not relevant to the approved activities of the MAP Participant;

        (26) U.S. office(s) administrative expenses, including communication costs, except as noted in paragraph (c)(21) of this section and except that usage costs for communications devices incurred while on reimbursable international or domestic travel for approved MAP brand or generic promotion activities are reimbursable as eligible travel expenditures as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);

        (27) Any expenditure on an activity that includes any derogatory reference or comparison to other U.S. agricultural commodities;

        (28) Payment of U.S. and foreign employees' or contractors' share of personal taxes, except where a foreign country's laws require the MAP Participant to pay such employees' or contractors' share;

        (29) Any expenditure made for an activity prior to CCC's approval of that activity;

        (30) Contributions to a contingency reserve or any similar provision made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of their happening;

        (31) Credit card fees;

        (32) Entertainment,  amusements, diversions, cover charges, personal gifts, or tickets to theatrical or sporting events;

        (33) Refreshments, or related equipment, for office staff; and

        (34) Expenditures associated with a MAP Participant's creation or review of their fraud prevention program, contracting procedures, or brand program operational procedures.

        (e) Paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section shall apply to the approval of Supergrades.

        (1) With respect to individuals who are not U.S. citizens and who are hired by MAP Participants either as employees or contractors acting as employees, CCC will not ordinarily reimburse any portion of such individual's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee or contractor works. However, a MAP Participant may seek a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor who will be employed as a country director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that employee or contractor as a Supergrade.

        (2) To request approval of a Supergrade, the MAP Participant shall provide CCC with a detailed description of both the duties and responsibilities of the position and the qualifications and background of the employee or contractor concerned. The Participant shall also justify why the comparable FSN salary level is insufficient.

        (3) Where a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a country director, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade I” salary level, equivalent to a single grade increase over the existing top grade of the FSN salary plan. The Supergrade I and its step increases are calculated by increasing each of the steps in the top FSN grade by the percentage difference between the second highest and the highest grade in the FSN salary plan. Where the non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/or offices in more than one country, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade II” salary level, which is calculated relative to a Supergrade I in the same way the latter is calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.

        (4) A U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another foreign country or countries shall not be considered a non-U.S. citizen.

        (f) For a brand promotion activity, CCC will reimburse no more than 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures made on that activity.

        (g) CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a MAP Participant's program year provided:

        (1) The activity was approved by CCC prior to the end of the program year;

        (2) The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and

        (3) All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.

        (h) A MAP Participant shall not use MAP funds for any activity, or any expenses incurred by the MAP Participant prior to the date specified in the approval letter or after the date the agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.

        (i) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, MAP-funded travel shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and MAP-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The MAP Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country(ies) in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.

        (j) CCC may determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.

        § 1485.18   Reimbursement procedures.

#### § § 1485.18

        (a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Participant may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing MAP activities, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Participant will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.

        (b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the MAP Participant's U.S. office to CCC. CCC will make all payments to Participants in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

        (c) Participants will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursement or advance at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

        (d) CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the end of a MAP Participant's program year.

        (e) If CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, the MAP Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (f) If a MAP Participant receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment which is later disallowed, the MAP Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (g) MAP funds may be expended by MAP Participants only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the agreement and approval letter. If a MAP Participant discovers that MAP funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (h) The MAP Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and its U.S. office shall report such actions in writing to the appropriate FAS Division Director.

        § 1485.19   Advances.

#### § § 1485.19

        (a)  In general, CCC operates the MAP on a reimbursable basis.

        (b)  A MAP Participant may request an advance of MAP funds from CCC for generic promotion activities, provided the MAP Participant meets the criteria for advance payments in 2 CFR part 200. CCC will not approve any request for an advance submitted after the end of a MAP Participant's program year. At any given time, total payments advanced shall not exceed 40 percent of a MAP Participant's total approved generic activity budget for the program year. CCC will not advance funds to a MAP Participant for brand promotion activities. When approving a request for an advance, CCC may require the MAP Participant to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the MAP. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, the Participant's history of performance in the MAP, the Participant's perceived financial stability and resources, and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Participant's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.

        (c)  A MAP Participant shall deposit and maintain all funds advanced by CCC in an insured account in the United States. The account shall be interest-bearing, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the MAP Participant on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the MAP Participant for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on MAP advances shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.

        (d)  A MAP Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved generic promotion activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of the 90 calendar days, the MAP Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        § 1485.20   Employment practices.

#### § § 1485.20

        (a) A MAP Participant shall enter into written contracts with all overseas employees who are paid in whole or in part with MAP funds and shall ensure that all terms, conditions, and related formalities of such contracts conform to governing local law.

        (b) A MAP Participant shall, in its overseas offices, conform its office hours, work week, and holidays to local law and to the custom generally observed by U.S. commercial entities in the local business community.

        (c) A MAP Participant may pay salaries or fees in any currency (U.S. or foreign) in conformance with contract specifications. Participants should consult local laws regarding currency restrictions.

        § 1485.21   Financial management.

#### § § 1485.21

        (a) A MAP Participant shall implement and maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles and complies with the standards in 2 CFR part 200.

        (b) A MAP Participant shall institute internal controls and provide written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities to ensure their compliance with these regulations.

        (c) A MAP Participant shall retain all records concerning a MAP program transaction for a period of five years after completion of the transaction and permit authorized officials of the U.S. Government to have full and complete access, for such five-year period, to such records. These records shall include all documents related to employment of any employees whose salaries are reimbursed in whole or in part with MAP funds, whether such employees are based in the United States or overseas, such as employment applications, contracts, position descriptions, leave records, salary changes, and all records pertaining to contractors.

        (d) A MAP Participant shall also maintain adequate documentation related to the proper disposition of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Participant and for which the Participant is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with MAP funds.

        (e) A MAP Participant shall maintain its records of expenditures, contributions, and cost share in a manner that allows it to provide information by program year, activity plan, country or region (as applicable), activity number, and cost category. Such records shall include copies of:

        (1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);

        (2) Receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a minimum level that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all MAP Participants via a program notice issued on the FAS website. Receipts for all actual M&IE reimbursements must be maintained, regardless of the amount;

        (3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;

        (4) Reimbursement claims;

        (5) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the MAP Participant's MAP accounts;

        (6) Documentation, with accompanying English translation, supporting each reimbursement claim, including evidence to support the financial transactions, such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, contracts, purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, and credit memos; and

        (7)(i) Each MAP Participant must keep records documenting all claimed contributions and cost share, to include:

        (A) Copies of invoices or receipts for expenses paid by the U.S. industry or State agency and not reimbursed by the MAP Participant for the joint activity, or

        (B) If invoices are not available, an itemized statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what costs it incurred pursuant to the joint activity, or

        (C) If neither of the foregoing is available, a statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what goods and services it provided, or

        (D) If none of the foregoing are available, a memo to the files of the MAP Participant's estimate of what contribution or cost share was made by the U.S. industry or State agency, item by item, and the method used to assign a value to each.

        (ii) The documentation required in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution or cost share, who conducted the activity, the participating groups or individuals, and the method of computing the claimed contribution or cost share. MAP Participants must retain and make available for compliance reviews and audits documentation related to claimed contribution or cost share.

        (f) Upon request, a MAP Participant shall provide documents supporting reimbursement claims to CCC. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by adequate documentation.

        § 1485.22   Reports.

#### § § 1485.22

        (a) Participants are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for the required financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Participant.

        (b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.329(c)(2), a Participant's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Participant's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Participant must provide an explanation in the report.

        (2) A Participant must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Participant's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Participant must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.

        (c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.

        (d) Not later than 45 calendar days after the completion of travel (other than local travel), a MAP Participant shall submit a trip report. The report must be submitted to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor(s) and must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.

        (e) Not later than 90 calendar days after the end of its program year, a MAP Participant shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved MAP program.

        (f) If requested by FAS, a Participant must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.

        (g) If a Participant requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.

        § 1485.23   Evaluation.

#### § § 1485.23

        (a)(1) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the MAP. Evaluation of the MAP's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by Participants of the constraints and opportunities facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for achievement, and assessment of results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP and of individual Participants' programming is to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A MAP Participant that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Participant's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.

        (2) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a MAP Participant's program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of program effectiveness.

        (b) When required by CCC, a MAP Participant shall complete a program evaluation.  A program evaluation is a review of the MAP Participant's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the MAP Participant and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the MAP Participant's strategy in meeting specified goals.  The actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the MAP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter. A MAP Participant may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy this requirement, although CCC reserves the right to have direct input and control over the design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the independent evaluator. A MAP Participant shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation. In addition to the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, a program evaluation shall contain:

        (1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;

        (2) The scope of the evaluation;

        (3) A concise statement of the market constraint(s)/opportunity(ies) and the goals specified in the approved strategic plan;

        (4) A description of the evaluation methodology;

        (5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the ratio of additional export sales in relation to the MAP Participant's program funding received;

        (6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and

        (7) Recommendations for future programs.

        (c) MAP Participants conducting a branded program must also complete a brand promotion evaluation. A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the activity achieved the goals specified in the approved MAP program. This evaluation shall be completed and submitted to CCC no later than 6 months following the end of the Participant's program year.

        (d) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by CCC, a MAP Participant shall complete and submit program success stories. CCC will announce to all MAP Participants the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.

> [85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]

        § 1485.24   Compliance reviews and notices.

#### § § 1485.24

        (a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of the Participant's activities under this program to ensure compliance with this subpart, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.

        (b) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.

        (c) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Participant. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the program, CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.

        (d) In addition, CCC may notify a Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Participant notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this subpart, the amount owed to CCC by the Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.

        (e) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Participant is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.

        (f) For a Participant response to compliance report:

        (1) A Participant shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Participant does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

        (2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to debt settlement policies and procedures, 7 CFR part 1403.

        (g) For Participant appeals of CCC determinations:

        (1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Participant may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.

        (2) If the Participant requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.

        (3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.

        § 1485.25   Failure to make required contribution or cost share.

#### § § 1485.25

        A MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share will be specified in the approval letter. If the MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share is specified as a dollar amount and the MAP Participant does not make the required contribution or cost share, the MAP Participant shall pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the MAP Participant may either return to CCC the necessary amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to increase its actual contribution or cost share percentage to the required level or pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution or cost share percentage to the required level. A MAP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the end of its program year. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        § 1485.26   Submissions.

#### § § 1485.26

        For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this subpart shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by CCC.

        § 1485.27   Disclosure of program information.

#### § § 1485.27

        (a) Documents submitted to CCC by MAP Participants are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, and specifically 7 CFR 1.12.

        (b) Upon request, a Participant shall provide to any person a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials.

        (c) Any research conducted by a MAP Participant pursuant to an agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.

        § 1485.28   Ethical conduct.

#### § § 1485.28

        (a) A MAP Participant shall conduct its business in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country(s) in which an activity is carried out and in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. A MAP Participant shall conduct its business in the United States in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

        (b) Except for a U.S. agricultural cooperative or a U.S. for-profit entity, neither a MAP Participant nor its affiliates shall make export sales of eligible commodities covered under the terms of the applicable MAP agreement. Nor shall such entities charge a fee for facilitating an export sale. A MAP Participant may, however, collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the MAP Participant's organization.

        (c) A MAP Participant shall not limit participation in its MAP activities to members of its organization. Participants shall ensure that their MAP-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors. The MAP Participant shall publicize its program and make participation possible for commercial entities throughout the relevant commodity sector or, in the case of SRTGs, throughout the corresponding region. This includes providing to such commercial entities, upon request, a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its MAP agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials. This paragraph does not apply to U.S. agricultural cooperatives when implementing their own brand program.

        (d) A MAP Participant shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in generic MAP activities such as trade teams, sales teams, and trade fairs based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by CCC, a MAP Participant shall submit such selection criteria to CCC for approval.

        (e) All MAP Participants should endeavor to ensure fair and accurate fact-based advertising. Deceptive or misleading promotions may result in cancellation or termination of a MAP Participant's agreement and the recovery of CCC funds related to such promotions from the Participant.

        (f) The MAP Participant must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of its MAP program to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and its U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to CCC.

        § 1485.29   Subawarding procedures.

#### § § 1485.29

        (a) MAP Participants have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all contracts and assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on contracts entered into by the MAP Participant. Neither CCC nor any other agency of the U.S. Government nor any official or employee of CCC, FAS, USDA, or the U.S. Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to MAP Participant contracts with third parties.

        (b) A MAP Participant shall comply with the procurement standards set forth below and in 2 CFR part 200 when procuring goods and services and when engaging in construction to implement agreements.

        (c) Each MAP Participant shall establish open, fair, and competitive contracting procedures for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with MAP funds.

        (d) Each MAP Participant shall submit to CCC, for CCC approval, written contracting guidelines for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with MAP funds. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of contracting guidelines. CCC's approval of such contracting guidelines will remain in place until CCC retracts its approval in writing, or until new guidelines are approved that supersede them. Once approved by CCC, these contracting guidelines shall govern all of a Participant's MAP-funded contracting involving contracts with an annual minimum value that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all MAP Participants via a program notice issued on the FAS website. The guidelines shall indicate the method for evaluating proposals received for all contract competitions, the method for monitoring and evaluating performance under contracts, and the method for initiating corrective action for unsatisfactory performance under contracts. The MAP Participant may modify and resubmit these guidelines for re-approval at any time. In addition to the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, these guidelines shall include, at a minimum, the following:

        (1) Procedures for developing and publicizing requests for proposals, invitations for bids, and similar documents that solicit third party offers to provide goods or services. Solicitations for professional and technical services shall be based on clear and accurate descriptions of and requirements related to the services to be procured. Such procedures must include a conflict of interest provision that states that no employee, officer, board member, or agent thereof of the MAP Participant will participate in the review, selection, award, or administration of a contract if a real or apparent conflict of interest would arise. Such a conflict would arise when an employee, official, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, or agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of these parties or their affiliates has a financial or other interest in the contract. Procedures shall provide that officers, employees, board members, and agents thereof shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors. Procedures shall also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, board members, or agents thereof;

        (2) Procedures for reviewing proposals, bids, or other offers to provide goods and services. Separate procedures shall be developed for various situations, including, but not limited to: solicitations for highly technical services; solicitations for services that are not common in a specific market; sole source contracts; solicitations that yield receipt of three or more bids; or solicitations that yield receipt of fewer than three bids;

        (3) Requirements to conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, and/or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement. MAP Participants' written contracting guidelines may detail special situations where the prohibitions in this subparagraph do not apply, such as in situations involving highly specialized technical services or situations where the services are not commonly offered in a specific market;

        (4) Requirements to perform and document in the procurement files some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices in connection with every procurement action that is governed by the contracting guidelines;

        (5) Requirements to conduct an appropriate form of competition every 3 years on all multi-year contracts that are governed by the contracting guidelines. However, contracts for market representation are not required to be re-competed after the initial reward. Instead, the performance of market representation must be evaluated and documented by the MAP Participant annually to ensure that the terms of the contract are being met in a satisfactory manner; and

        (6) Requirements for written contracts with each provider of goods, services, or construction work. Such contracts shall require such providers to maintain adequate records to account for funds provided to them by the MAP Participant.

        (e) A MAP Participant may undertake MAP promotional activities directly or through a domestic or foreign subrecipient. However, the MAP Participant shall remain responsible and accountable to CCC for all MAP promotional activities and related expenditures undertaken by such subrecipient and shall be responsible for reimbursing CCC for any funds that CCC determines should be refunded to CCC in relation to such subrecipient's promotional activities and expenditures.

        § 1485.30   Property standards.

#### § § 1485.30

        (a) A Participant shall maintain an inventory of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more that was acquired in furtherance of program activities. The inventory shall list and number each item and include the date of purchase or acquisition, cost of purchase, replacement value, serial number, make, model, and electrical requirements, as applicable.

        (b) The Participant shall insure all real property and equipment that was acquired, in whole or in part, with MAP funds at a level minimally equal to the equivalent insurance coverage for property owned by the Participant. The Participant shall safeguard such property and equipment against theft, damage, and unauthorized use. The Participant shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of such property and equipment to the insurance company.

        (c) Personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Participant, and for which the Participant is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with MAP funds, that is unusable, unserviceable, or no longer needed for project purposes shall be disposed of in one of the following ways. The Participant may:

        (1) Exchange or sell the property, provided that it applies any exchange allowance, insurance proceeds, or sales proceeds toward the purchase of other property needed in the project;

        (2) With CCC approval, transfer the property to other Participants for their activities, or to a foreign entity; or

        (3) Upon Attaché/Counselor approval, donate the property to a local charity, or convey the property to the Attaché/Counselor, along with an itemized inventory list and any documents of title.

        (d) The Participant is responsible for reimbursing CCC for the value of any uninsured property at the time of the loss or theft of the property.

        § 1485.31   Anti-fraud requirements.

#### § § 1485.31

        (a)  (1) All MAP Participants annually shall submit to CCC for approval a detailed fraud prevention program. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of fraud prevention programs. MAP Participants should review their fraud prevention programs annually. The fraud prevention program shall, at a minimum, include an annual review of physical controls and weaknesses, a standard process for investigating and remediation of suspected fraud cases, and training in risk management and fraud detection for all current and future employees. The MAP Participant shall not conduct or permit any MAP promotion activities to occur unless and until CCC has communicated in writing approval of the MAP Participant's fraud prevention program.

        (2) The MAP Participant, within five business days of receiving an allegation or information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of misrepresentation or fraud that could give rise to a claim by CCC, shall report such allegation or information in writing to such USDA personnel as specified in the Participant's agreement and/or approval letter. The MAP Participant shall cooperate fully in any USDA investigation of such allegation or occurrence of misrepresentation or fraud and shall comply with any directives given by CCC or USDA to the MAP Participant for the prompt investigation of such allegation or occurrence.

        (b)  (1) The MAP Participant may charge a fee to brand participants to cover the cost of the fraud prevention program.

        (2) The MAP Participant shall repay to CCC funds paid to a brand participant through the MAP Participant on claims that the MAP Participant or CCC subsequently determines are unauthorized or otherwise non-reimbursable expenses within 30 calendar days of the MAP Participant's determination or CCC's disallowance. The MAP Participant shall repay CCC by submitting a check to CCC or by offsetting the MAP Participant's next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. A MAP Participant operating a brand program in strict accordance with an approved fraud prevention program, however, will not be liable to reimburse CCC for MAP funds paid on such claims if the claims were based on misrepresentations or fraud of the brand participant, its employees, or agents, unless CCC determines that the MAP Participant was grossly negligent in the operation of the brand program regarding such claims. CCC shall communicate any such determination to the MAP Participant in writing.

        § 1485.32   Program income.

#### § § 1485.32

        Program income is gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with MAP funds, shall be used by the MAP Participant in furtherance of its approved MAP activities in the program year during which the MAP funds are available for obligation by the MAP Participant, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this subpart. Interest earned on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for approved activities. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to FAS. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as contribution or cost share.

        § 1485.33   Amendments.

#### § § 1485.33

        An agreement may be amended in writing with the consent of CCC and the MAP Participant. All requests for program amendments must be submitted to CCC in writing and contain a justification for why the amendment is necessary. All amendment requests must be reviewed and approved by CCC before an amendment can be issued.

        § 1485.34   Subrecipients.

#### § § 1485.34

        (a) A Participant may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Participant for this purpose. The Participant must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.332 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Participant must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.

        (b) A Participant must include the following requirements in a subaward:

        (1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.

        (2) The subrecipient must pay to the Participant the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

        (3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

        (c) A Participant must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.

        § 1485.35   Audit requirements.

#### § § 1485.35

        (a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Participants and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.

        (b) A Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Participant or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy this requirement:

        (1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Participant or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or

        (ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Participant or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or

        (2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

        (c) A Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.

        (d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Participant or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.

        (e) When a Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipiet that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.

        (f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Participants or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Participants and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).

        § 1485.36   Suspension and termination of agreements.

#### § § 1485.36

        (a) An agreement or subaward may be suspended or terminated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340. FAS may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:

        (1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340 for termination or suspension by FAS has been satisfied; or

        (2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable.

        (b) If an agreement is terminated, the Participant:

        (1) Is responsible for using or returning any CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed, as agreed to by FAS; and

        (2) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.344 and 200.345.

> [85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]

        § 1485.37   Noncompliance with an agreement.

#### § § 1485.37

        (a) If a MAP Participant fails to comply with any term in its agreement or approval letter, CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the MAP Participant, following the procedures set forth in this subpart. CCC may also initiate a claim against a MAP Participant if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the MAP Participant. If any MAP Participant has engaged in fraud with respect to the MAP, or has otherwise violated program requirements under this subpart, CCC may:

        (1) Hold such MAP Participant liable for any and all losses to CCC resulting from such fraud or violation;

        (2) Require a refund of any assistance provided to such MAP Participant plus interest as determined by FAS; and

        (3) Collect liquidated damages from such MAP Participant in an amount determined appropriate by FAS.

        (b) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy that is available under any other provision of law.

        § 1485.38   Paperwork reduction requirements.

#### § § 1485.38

        The paperwork and recordkeeping requirements imposed by this subpart have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has assigned control number 0551-0026 for this information collection.

    PART 1486—EMERGING MARKETS PROGRAM

### Part 1486

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 5623, 5662-5663.

**Source:** Source: 84 FR 69986, Dec. 20, 2019, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 1486.100   General purpose and scope.

#### § § 1486.100

        (a) The E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Markets Program (EMP) is established to develop, maintain, or expand markets for exports of United States agricultural commodities and to promote cooperation and exchange of information between agricultural institutions and agribusinesses in the United States and emerging markets. While the program is primarily intended to support the export market development efforts of the private sector, the program's resources may also be used to assist public agricultural organizations.

        (b) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the EMP.

        (c)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

        (2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to the EMP.

        (3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, IV, also apply to the EMP, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the EMP.

        (d) Under the EMP, CCC provides grants to eligible U.S. private or government entities who demonstrate a role or interest in the export of U.S. agricultural commodities to conduct assessments of food and rural business system needs of emerging markets, make recommendations on measures necessary to enhance the effectiveness of such systems, including potential reductions in trade barriers, and identify and carry out specific opportunities and projects to enhance the effectiveness of such systems. The EMP may only be used to support exports of U.S. agricultural commodities through generic activities.

        (e) Only initiatives that support the export of U.S. agricultural commodities are eligible for assistance under the program. The program's resources may not be used to support the export of another country's products to the United States or another country, or to promote the development of a foreign economy as a primary objective.

        (f) The EMP generally operates on a reimbursement basis. The program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of CCC.

        (g) EMP recipients are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

        § 1486.101   Definitions.

#### § § 1486.101

        For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

        means components of a project that carries out one or more statutorily-authorized activities,  activities that assess the food and rural business system needs of emerging markets; promote information exchange with such markets; and/or carry out recommendations, projects, and opportunities in emerging markets to enhance the effectiveness of such systems.

        means a legally binding grant entered into between CCC and an EMP applicant setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under the EMP, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.

        means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its EMP proposal has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement.

        means the FAS employee representing United States Department of Agriculture interests in a foreign country.

        means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). In terms of the EMP program, cost share is the funds provided by the Recipient, the U.S. industry, or a State agency in support of an approved activity.

        means generally any country, foreign territory, customs union, or other economic market that CCC determines is taking steps toward a market-oriented economy through its food, agriculture, or rural business sectors of the economy and has the potential to provide a viable and significant market for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC has determined that any country that is not designated as a high-income country by the World Bank is an eligible emerging market under this program. The World Bank periodically redefines the income limits for its country classification. Consequently, the list of “emerging market” countries may change over time. CCC will provide guidance on country eligibility in each program announcement.

        mean an activity that does not involve or promote the exclusive or predominant use of an individual company name, logo, or brand name, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, but rather promotes a U.S. agricultural commodity generally.

        means an approach or undertaking made up of one or more activities that, taken together, carries out one or more statutorily-authorized activities under the EMP ( activities that assess the food and rural business system needs of emerging markets and develop recommendations on measures necessary to enhance the effectiveness of such systems; promote information exchange with such markets; or identify and carry out specific recommendations, opportunities, or projects to enhance the effectiveness of such systems).

        means the funds made available to a Recipient by CCC under an agreement and authorized for expenditure in accordance with this part.

        means an application for funding.

        means a U.S. entity receiving financial assistance from CCC to carry out a project under the EMP.

        is the acronym for State Regional Trade Group. An STRG is a non-profit association of state-funded agricultural promotion agencies.

        is the acronym for sales and trade relations expenditures. Expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.

        means an online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants may apply to the EMP and other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at  FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to EMP and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).

        means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.

        § 1486.102   Regional projects.

#### § § 1486.102

        Projects that focus on regions, such as the Caribbean Basin, rather than individual countries are eligible for consideration provided such projects target qualifying emerging markets in the specified region. CCC may also consider activities that target qualified emerging markets in a specific region but are conducted in a non-emerging market because of its importance as a central location and ease of access to that region.

      Subpart B—Eligibility, Applications, and Funding

        § 1486.200   Participation eligibility.

#### § § 1486.200

        (a) To participate in the EMP, U.S. private or government entities must demonstrate a role or interest in the exports of U.S. agricultural commodities. Government organizations consist of Federal, state, and local agencies. Private entities include non-profit trade associations, universities, agricultural cooperatives, SRTGs, consulting businesses, research institutions, and profit-making entities. Foreign organizations, whether government or private, may participate as subrecipients in activities carried out by U.S. entities, but are not eligible for direct funding assistance from the program.

        (b) Proposals from research and consulting entities will be considered for funding assistance only with evidence of substantial participation in and financial support to the proposed project by U.S. industry. Such support is most credibly demonstrated through actual monetary contributions to the cost of the project.

        (c) For-profit entities shall not use program funds to conduct private business, promote private self-interests, or promote their own products or services beyond specific uses approved in a given project. For-profit entities shall not use program funds to supplement the costs of normal day-to-day operations.

        § 1486.201   Eligible commodities.

#### § § 1486.201

        Any agricultural commodity or product thereof, excluding tobacco, that is comprised of at least 50 percent by weight, exclusive of added water, of agricultural commodities grown or raised in the United States is eligible for funding. Projects that seek support for multiple commodities are also eligible.

        § 1486.202   Application process.

#### § § 1486.202

        (a)  CCC will periodically announce that it is accepting applications for participation in the EMP. All relevant information, including application deadlines and proposal content, will be noted in the announcement, and proposals must be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system but are not required to do so. CCC may request any additional information it deems necessary from any applicant in order to properly evaluate any proposal.

        (b)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the EMP and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:

        (1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

        (2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and

        (3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.

        (c)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the EMP and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive EMP funding.

        § 1486.203   Application review and formation of agreements.

#### § § 1486.203

        (a)  Proposals received in accordance with the announcement and this part will undergo a multi-phase review by CCC to determine eligibility for the program, the qualifications, quality, and appropriateness of proposed projects, and the reasonableness of proposed project budgets.

        (b)  CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. All proposals that meet the eligibility and completeness criteria described in the NOFO and receive a passing score will be recommended for funding to the FAS Administrator. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. Demonstration of substantial U.S. industry participation in or financial or other support of a proposal will be a positive factor in the consideration of proposals. The degree of commitment to a proposed project, represented by the amount and type of cost share, is used in determining which proposals will be approved. Proposals in which the private sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost share will be given priority consideration. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.

        (c)  CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the announcement and this part. All decisions regarding the disposition of an application are final.

        § 1486.204   Funding limits.

#### § § 1486.204

        (a) The EMP is a relatively small program intended to develop, maintain, or expand access to qualified emerging markets. Its funds are intended for focused projects with specific activities, rather than expansive concept papers that contain only broad ideas. Large, overly expensive projects ( in excess of $500,000) will not be funded.

        (b) CCC will not reimburse 100 percent of the cost of any project undertaken by the private sector. The program is intended to provide appropriate assistance to projects that have significant financial contributions from other sources, especially U.S. private industry.

        (c) Proposals for projects exceeding one year in duration may be considered, but proposals for projects that last longer than five years will not be considered. If approved, funding for multi-year projects may be provided one year at a time, with commitments beyond the first-year subject to interim evaluations intended to assess the progress of the project toward meeting its intended objectives.

        (d) Funding for continuing and substantially similar projects is generally limited to three calendar years, although FAS will entertain requests to extend an agreement's expiration date up to a maximum of five calendar years. After that time, the project is assumed to have proven its viability and, if necessary, should be continued by the Recipient with its own or with alternative sources of funding. Recipients must submit in writing a valid justification for why an extension is necessary no later than 60 days before the end of the period of performance. If warranted, extensions generally will be granted in one-year increments. Recipients must wait for written approval from FAS before proceeding with the project.

      Subpart C—Program Operations

        § 1486.300   Applicant notification.

#### § § 1486.300

        (a) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final decision on its application. CCC will send an agreement and an approval letter to each approved applicant. An applicant that accepts the terms and conditions contained in the agreement must so indicate by having the appropriate authorizing official sign the agreement and return it to CCC. The applicant may not begin to implement approved activities until the applicant's authorizing official and CCC have signed the agreement. The applicant is authorized to begin implementation of the project as of the date specified in the approval letter, unless otherwise indicated.

        (b) The approval letter and agreement will outline the activities and budgets that are approved and will specify the terms and conditions applicable to the project, including the levels of EMP funding and cost-share requirements.

        § 1486.301   Amendments.

#### § § 1486.301

        (a) Recipients may request to modify approved projects if circumstances change in such a way that they would likely affect the progress and ultimate success of a project. Such modification must be made through a written amendment to the agreement. All requests for project modifications must be made in writing to CCC and must include:

        (1) A justification as to why changes to the project as originally designed are needed;

        (2) An explanation of the necessary adjustments in approach or strategy; and

        (3) A description of necessary changes in the project's time line(s) and/or budget ( shifting of budgetary resources from one-line item to another in order to accommodate the changes).

        (b) All requests for project modifications must be reviewed and approved by CCC. Upon approval, CCC will issue an amendment to the agreement, which must be signed by CCC and the Recipient.

        § 1486.302   Subrecipients.

#### § § 1486.302

        (a) A Recipient may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Recipient for this purpose. The Recipient must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.331 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Recipient must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.

        (b) A Recipient must include the following requirements in a subaward:

        (1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.

        (2) The subrecipient must pay to the Recipient the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

        (3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

        (c) A Recipient must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.

        (d) Recipients have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all subawards they may enter into with one or more subrecipients in order to carry out an approved project and shall assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on subawards entered into by the Recipient. Neither CCC nor any other agency of the United States Government nor any official or employee of CCC, FAS, USDA, or the United States Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to Recipient subawards with third parties.

        (e) Recipients are responsible for ensuring to the greatest extent possible that the terms, conditions, and costs of subawards constitute the most economical and effective use of project funds.

        (f) All fees for professional and technical services paid to subrecipients in any part with project funds must be covered by written subawards.

        (g) A Recipient shall:

        (1) Ensure that all expenditures for goods and services in excess of $25 reimbursed by CCC are documented by a purchase order or invoice;

        (2) Ensure that no employee, officer, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, or agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, participates in the review, selection, award or administration of a subaward in which such entities or their affiliates have a financial or other interest;

        (3) Conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned shall be excluded from competition for such procurement;

        (4) Conduct all awarding of grants and agreements in an openly competitive manner, except under the following conditions:

        (i) Non-monetary awards of property or services;

        (ii) Awards of less than $75,000;

        (iii) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award;

        (iv) Awards that cannot be delayed due to an emergency or a substantial danger to health or safety;

        (v) Awards when it is impracticable to secure competition; or

        (vi) Awards to fund unique and innovative unsolicited applications;

        (5) Base each solicitation for professional or technical services on a clear and accurate description of and requirements related to the services to be procured;

        (6) Perform and document some form of fee, price, or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered fees or prices for procurements in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold defined at 2 CFR 200.88; and

        (7) Document the decision-making process.

      Subpart D—Cost Share and Reimbursements

        § 1486.400   Cost share.

#### § § 1486.400

        (a) The EMP is intended to complement, not supplant, the efforts of the U.S. private sector. Therefore, no private sector proposal will be considered without the element of cost share from the Recipient and/or U.S. partners.

        (b) There is no minimum or maximum required amount of cost share. The degree of commitment to a proposed project, represented by the amount and type of private funding, is used as one factor in determining which proposals will be approved. The type of cost share is also not specified, though some contributions are ineligible (see § 1486.402). Cost share may be actual cash invested or professional time of staff assigned to the project. Proposals in which the private sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost share will be given priority consideration.

        (c) Cost share is not required for proposals from Federal, state, or local government agencies. It is mandatory from all other eligible entities, even when they are party to a joint proposal with a government agency.

        (d) Contributions from foreign (non-U.S.) organizations may not be counted toward the cost share requirement but may be included in the total cost of the project.

        (e) An activity that is undertaken by an entity at the request of FAS may be exempted from the cost share requirement. This determination is made at the discretion of FAS.

        (f) A Recipient's cost share requirement will be specified in the agreement and approval letter. If a Recipient fails to contribute the total specified in the agreement, the difference between the amount contributed and the total amount required must be repaid to CCC in U.S. dollars within six months after the end of the period of performance of the agreement. If a Recipient is reimbursed by CCC for less than the amount of funds approved in the agreement, then the final required cost share shall equal, on a percentage basis, the original ratio of cost share to the authorized EMP funding level.

        § 1486.401   Eligible cost share.

#### § § 1486.401

        (a) In calculating the amount of cost share that it will make and the cost share U.S. entities or a State or local agency will make, a Recipient may include those costs (or such prorated costs) not proscribed under § 1486.402 if:

        (1) The expenditures are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the Recipient's overall EMP;

        (2) The expenditures are not included as cost share for any other Federal award;

        (3) The expenditures are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs; and

        (4) The cost share is made during the period covered by the agreement.

        (b) Cost share must be included in a project's line item budget.

        § 1486.402   Ineligible cost share.

#### § § 1486.402

        (a) The following are not eligible as cost share:

        (1) Normal operating expenses and other costs not directly related to the project;

        (2) Any portion of salary or compensation of an individual who is the target of an approved project activity;

        (3) The cost of insuring articles owned by private individuals;

        (4) The cost of product development, product modification, or product research;

        (5) Slotting fees or similar sales expenditures;

        (6) Funds, services, capital goods, or personnel provided by any U.S. Government agency;

        (7) The value of any services generated by a Recipient or a third party that involve no expenditure by the Recipient or third party,  free publicity;

        (8) The cost of developing any application/proposal for EMP funding;

        (9) Membership fees in clubs and social organizations; and

        (10) Any expenditure for an activity prior to CCC's approval of that activity.

        (b) CCC shall determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section may be included as an eligible cost share.

        § 1486.403   Reimbursement rules.

#### § § 1486.403

        (a) A Recipient may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

        (1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and

        (2) The Recipient has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

        (b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, as well as applicable cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

        (1) Salaries and benefits of the Recipient's existing personnel or any other participating entity that are directly assigned to EMP-funded projects. Salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Federal, state, and local government Recipients may not be reimbursed for salaries and benefits. Reimbursement of salaries and benefits for other Recipients is limited to:

        (i) The actual daily rate paid by the Recipient for the employee's salary or the daily rate of a GS-15, Step 10 U.S. Government employee in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding, whichever is less;

        (ii) The actual assigned time of the employee to the project; and

        (iii) Benefits at a maximum rate of 30 percent of the existing salary of the employee, prorated to the time assigned to the project, provided that such benefits are required and granted pursuant to the Recipient's established written policies.

        (2) Consulting fees for professional services, limited to the daily rate of a GS-15, Step 10 U.S. Government employee in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding. Reimbursement is authorized only for actual days worked and is not authorized for travel and rest days. Benefits are not reimbursable.

        (3) STRE for social events or receptions that are primarily attended by foreign officials and that are held at foreign venues and are part of an approved activity. Such expenses must conform to the American Embassy representational funding guidelines as the standard for judging the appropriateness of the STRE costs. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. Recipients must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. STRE incurred in the United States is not authorized for reimbursement but may be counted as a cost share to the project.

        (4) Travel expenses, subject to the following:

        (i) All expenses while in travel status must conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);

        (ii) Air travel must comply with the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1517) and is limited to the full-fare economy class rate;

        (iii) Per diem is limited to the allowable rate for each domestic or foreign locale (41 CFR part 301-11). Expenses in excess of the authorized per diem rates may be allowed in special or unusual circumstances (41 CFR part 301-11), but must be approved in advance; and

        (iv) The Recipient shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel by the Recipient or its consultants or other Recipients. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.

        (5) Direct administrative costs.

        (6) Indirect costs not identified as direct costs, but which are necessary for the implementation of a project. Indirect costs must be specified to be eligible for reimbursement. Indirect costs may be reimbursed up to a maximum of 10 percent of the EMP-funded portion of the project budget, excluding indirect costs, except that Recipients in FAS' Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, SRTGs, for-profit entities, and government Recipients may not be reimbursed for indirect costs.

        (7) Rental costs for equipment necessary to carry out approved projects. Equipment rentals must be returned by the Recipient to the supplier in accordance with the lease agreements, but in no case later than 90 calendar days from the completion date of the project.

        (8) Procuring samples of specific agricultural commodities that are appropriate and necessary to the success of a technical assistance activity.

        § 1486.404   Ineligible expenditures.

#### § § 1486.404

        (a) CCC will not reimburse expenditures made prior to approval of a Recipient's proposal, unreasonable expenditures, or any cost of:

        (1) Branded product promotions,  in-store promotions, restaurant advertising, labeling, etc.;

        (2) Administrative and operational expenses for trade shows;

        (3) Advertising;

        (4) Preparation and printing of magazines, brochures, flyers, posters, etc., except in connection with specific approved activities such as training;

        (5) Design, development, and maintenance of information technology projects;

        (6) Purchase of equipment,  office equipment or other fixed assets;

        (7) Subsidizing or otherwise providing funds for graduate programs at colleges and/or universities (salaries or fees for individual students who are directly assigned to specific project activities appropriate to their backgrounds may be covered on a pro-rated basis);

        (8) Subsidizing normal, day-to-day operating costs of an entity, except as allowed under § 1486.403(b)(6);

        (9) Honoraria for speakers;

        (10) Costs of product research or new product development;

        (11) Costs of developing technical assistance proposals submitted to the program;

        (12) Refundable deposits or advances;

        (13) STRE expenses within the United States;

        (14) All costs related to the shipping, over land and sea, of commodity samples;

        (15) Expenses, fines, settlements, judgments, or payments relating to legal suits, challenges, or disputes, including legal fees and costs associated with trade disputes, except as otherwise allowed in 2 CFR part 200;

        (16) Real estate costs other than allowable rental costs for office space whose use is assigned specifically to a project funded by the EMP; and

        (17) Any expenditure that has been or will be reimbursed by any other source.

        (b) CCC may determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.

        § 1486.405   Reimbursement procedures.

#### § § 1486.405

        (a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Recipient may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing an EMP project, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Recipient will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.

        (b) CCC will make all payments to the Recipients in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

        (c) Recipients will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursements or advances at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

        (d) Recipients may submit claims for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in implementing EMP projects, to the extent CCC has agreed to pay for such costs, limited initially to 85 percent of the total amount specified in the agreement. The Recipient may be reimbursed for the remaining 15 percent of the funds only after the final performance report containing the information required by the agreement is submitted to and approved by FAS.

        (e) Final claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 calendar days after the completion date of the project or following the expiration or termination date of the agreement, whichever is sooner, and are subject to FAS approval of the Recipient's final performance report. Recipients are required to use a prescribed system to submit their claims. This system will be clearly stated in the NOFO. Currently the CCC's internet-based UES system is being used to request reimbursement for eligible EMP program expenses.

        (f) Recipients shall maintain complete records of all program expenditures, identified by EMP agreement number, program year, country or region, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall be accompanied by documentation that supports the expenditure and shall be made available to CCC upon request. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by acceptable documentation.

        (g) In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is disallowed after payment already has been made, the Recipient shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment or disallowance the amount overpaid or disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC and referencing the applicable project, or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

        (h) The Recipient shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and FAS Division Director.

        § 1486.406   Advances.

#### § § 1486.406

        (a)  In general, CCC operates the EMP on a cost reimbursable basis.

        (b)  Upon request, CCC may make advance payments to a Recipient against an approved project budget. Up to 40 percent of the approved project budget may be provided as an advance, either at one time or in incremental payments. Advances should be limited to the minimum amounts needed and requested as close as is administratively feasible to the actual time of disbursement by the Recipient. Reimbursement claims will be used to offset advances. Recipients shall deposit and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Recipient on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Recipient for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.

        (c)  A Recipient shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of 90 calendar days, the Recipient must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

      Subpart E—Reporting, Evaluation, and Compliance

        § 1486.500   Reports.

#### § § 1486.500

        (a) Recipients are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for both annual financial and performance reports and final financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Recipient.

        (b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2), a Recipient's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Recipient's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Recipient must provide an explanation in the report.

        (2) A Recipient must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Recipient's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Recipient must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.

        (c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.

        (d) If requested by FAS, a Recipient must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.

        (e) If a Recipient requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.

        § 1486.501   Evaluation.

#### § § 1486.501

        Project evaluations may be carried out by CCC at its option with or without Recipients. CCC may also seek outside expertise to conduct or participate in evaluations.

        § 1486.502   Compliance reviews and notices.

#### § § 1486.502

        (a)  (1) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of Recipient's activities under the EMP to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Recipients shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.

        (2) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.

        (3) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Recipient. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Recipient is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Recipient and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Recipient. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the EMP, CCC may require the Recipient to contract for an independent audit.

        (4) In addition, CCC may notify a Recipient in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Recipient. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Recipient in the written notice. The Recipient shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Recipient notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Recipient intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Recipient is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.

        (5) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Recipient is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.

        (b)  (1) A Recipient shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Recipient does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

        (2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Recipient owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Recipient in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Recipient a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to the debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.

        (c)  (1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Recipient may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Recipient may also request a hearing.

        (2) If the Recipient requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Recipient bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.

        (3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Recipient must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.

        § 1486.503   Records retention.

#### § § 1486.503

        Each Recipient shall retain all records relating to the project for three calendar years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. All records related to the project, including records pertaining to contractors, shall be made available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

        § 1486.504   Program income.

#### § § 1486.504

        Program income means gross income earned by the Recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any such income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with EMP funds, shall be used by the Recipient in furtherance of its approved activities in the program period during which the EMP funds are available for obligation by the Recipient, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this part. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for projects approved for program funding. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to CCC. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as cost share.

        § 1486.505   Audit requirements.

#### § § 1486.505

        (a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Recipients and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.

        (b) A Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Recipient or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy the requirement in this paragraph (b):

        (1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or

        (ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or

        (2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

        (c) A Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.

        (d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Recipient or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.

        (e) When a Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.

        (f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Recipients or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Recipients and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).

      § 1487.1   General purpose and scope.

#### § § 1487.1

      (a) Under the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), an agency and instrumentality of the United States within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides grant funds to eligible organizations to implement activities that are intended to address existing or potential sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical barriers that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S. specialty crops that are currently available on a commercial basis. The TASC program is intended to benefit the represented industry rather than a specific company or brand.

      (b) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing CCC's operation of the TASC program.

      (c)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

      (2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to the TASC program.

      (3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the TASC program, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory provisions or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the TASC program.

      (d) The TASC program generally operates on a reimbursement basis. The program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), acting on behalf of CCC.

      § 1487.2   Definitions.

#### § § 1487.2

      For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

      means a legally binding grant entered into between CCC and a TASC applicant setting forth the terms and conditions to implement an approved project under the TASC program, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.

      means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its TASC proposal has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement.

      means the FAS employee representing United States Department of Agriculture interests in a foreign country.

      means any U.S. organization that demonstrates a role or interest in the exports of specialty crops, including, but not limited to: U.S. Government agencies, State government agencies, non-profit trade associations, universities, agricultural cooperatives, and private companies.

      means an entity that has entered into a TASC agreement with CCC.

      means most cultivated plants produced in the United States, or the products thereof, except wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco.

      means the online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants currently may apply to TASC and the other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at  FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to TASC and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).

      means each of the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the _United States_.

      § 1487.3   Program eligibility.

#### § § 1487.3

      (a) An eligible organization can submit an application under this part to become a Participant under the TASC Program. FAS will set forth specific eligibility information, including any factors or priorities that will affect the eligibility of an applicant or application for selection, in the full text of the applicable NOFO posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities.

      (b) In order to be eligible for funding under the TASC program, activities must address existing or potential sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical barriers to the export of U.S. specialty crops. Examples of expenses that CCC may agree to cover under the TASC program include but are not limited to expenses associated with: Initial pre-clearance programs, export protocol and work plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database development, reasonable logistical and administrative support, and travel and per diem expenses.

      (c) Eligible projects may take place in the United States or abroad.

      (d) Proposals from research and consulting entities will be considered for funding assistance only with evidence of substantial participation in and financial support to the proposed project by U.S. industry. Such support is most credibly demonstrated through actual monetary contributions to the cost of the project.

      (e) Foreign organizations, whether government or private, may participate as third parties in activities carried out by U.S. entities, but are not eligible for funding assistance from the program.

      § 1487.4   Limits on the scope of proposals.

#### § § 1487.4

      (a)  Proposals that request more than $500,000 of CCC funding in a given year will not be considered.

      (b)  Awards will generally be granted for a project period not exceeding five calendar years. However, FAS will entertain requests to extend agreements beyond five years when valid justifications are submitted. Participants must submit in writing a valid justification for why an extension is necessary no later than 60 days before the end of the period of performance. Extensions generally will be granted in one-year increments, if warranted. A Participant must wait for written approval from FAS before proceeding with the project.

      (c)  Proposals may target barriers in any eligible export market, including single countries or reasonable regional groupings of countries.

      (d)  Applicants may submit multiple proposals, but no Participant may have more than five approved projects underway at any given time.

      (e)  Participants shall not use program funds to supplement the costs of normal day-to-day operations or to promote their own products or services beyond specific uses approved in a given project.

      § 1487.5   Application process.

#### § § 1487.5

      (a)  CCC will periodically announce that it is accepting applications for participation in the TASC program. All relevant information, including application deadlines and proposal content, will be noted in the announcement, and proposals must be submitted in accordance with the terms and conditions, as well as other requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system, but are not required to use the UES system. CCC may request any additional information it deems necessary from any applicant in order to properly evaluate any proposal

      (b)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the TASC program and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:

      (1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

      (2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and

      (3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.

      (c)  In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the TASC program and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive TASC funding.

      § 1487.6   Application review and formation of agreements.

#### § § 1487.6

      (a)  Proposals received in accordance with the announcement and this part will undergo a multi-phase review by CCC to determine eligibility for the program, the qualifications, quality, and appropriateness of proposed projects, and the reasonableness of proposed project budgets.

      (b)  CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. Demonstration of substantial U.S. industry participation in or financial or other support of a proposal will be a positive factor in the consideration of proposals. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.

      (c)  CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the announcement and this part. All decisions regarding the disposition of an application are final.

      § 1487.7   Applicant notification.

#### § § 1487.7

      (a) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final decision on its application. CCC will send an agreement and an approval letter to each approved applicant. An applicant that accepts the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and approval letter must so indicate by having the appropriate authorizing official sign the agreement and submit it to CCC. The applicant may not begin to implement approved activities until the applicant's authorizing official and CCC have signed the agreement. The applicant is authorized to begin implementation of the project as of the date specified in the approval letter, unless otherwise indicated.

      (b) The approval letter and agreement will outline the activities and budgets that are approved and will specify the terms and conditions applicable to the project, including the levels of TASC funding and cost share requirements.

      § 1487.8   Reimbursements and advances.

#### § § 1487.8

      (a)  (1) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Participant may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing a TASC project, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Participant will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.

      (2) CCC will make all payments to the Participants in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

      (3) Participants will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursements or advances at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

      (4) Participants may submit claims for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in implementing TASC projects, to the extent CCC has agreed to pay for such costs, limited initially to 85 percent of the total amount specified in the agreement. The Participant may be reimbursed for the remaining 15 percent of the funds only after the final performance report containing the information required by the agreement is submitted to and approved by FAS.

      (5) Final claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 calendar days after the completion date of the project or following the expiration or termination date of the agreement, whichever is sooner, and are subject to FAS approval of the Participant's final performance report. Participants are required to use a prescribed system to submit their claims. This system will be clearly stated in the NOFO. Currently the CCC's internet-based UES system is being used to request reimbursement for eligible TASC program expenses.

      (6) Participants shall maintain complete records of all program expenditures, identified by TASC agreement number, program year, country or region, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall be accompanied by documentation that supports the expenditure and shall be made available to CCC upon request. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by acceptable documentation.

      (7) In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is disallowed after payment already has been made, the Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment or disallowance the amount overpaid or disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC and referencing the applicable project, or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

      (8) The Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and FAS Division Director.

      (b) —(1)  In general, CCC operates the TASC program on a cost reimbursable basis.

      (2)  Upon request, CCC may make advance payments to a Participant against an approved project budget. Participants may request an advance of up to 85 percent of the funding approved in any given program year. Advances should be limited to the minimum amounts needed and requested as close as is administratively feasible to the actual time of disbursement by the Participant. Reimbursement claims will be used to offset advances. Participants shall deposit and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Participant on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Participant for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.

      (3)  A Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of 90 calendar days, the Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

      § 1487.9   Reporting.

#### § § 1487.9

      (a) Participants are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for both annual financial and performance reports and final financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Participant.

      (b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2), a Participant's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Participant's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Participant must provide an explanation in the report.

      (2) A Participant must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Participant's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Participant must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.

      (c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.

      (d) If requested by FAS, a Participant must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.

      (e) If a Participant requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.

      § 1487.10   Notification of international travel.

#### § § 1487.10

      The Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel by the Participant or its consultants or other participants. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.

      § 1487.11   Evaluation.

#### § § 1487.11

      Project evaluations may be carried out by CCC at its option with or without Participants. CCC may also seek outside expertise to conduct or participate in evaluations.

      § 1487.12   Compliance reviews and notices

#### § § 1487.12

      (a)  (1) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of Participant's activities under the TASC program to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.

      (2) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.

      (3) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Participant. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the TASC program, CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.

      (4) In addition, CCC may notify a Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Participant notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.

      (5) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Participant is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.

      (b)  (1) A Participant shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Participant does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

      (2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to the debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.

      (c)  (1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Participant may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.

      (2) If the Participant requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.

      (3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.

      § 1487.13   Records retention.

#### § § 1487.13

      All records related to the project, including records pertaining to subawards, shall be made available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

      § 1487.14   Program income.

#### § § 1487.14

      Program income means gross income earned by the Participant that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any such income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with TASC funds, shall be used by the Participant in furtherance of its approved activities in the program period during which the TASC funds are available for obligation by the Participant, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this part. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for projects approved for program funding. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to CCC. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as cost share.

      § 1487.15   Subrecipients.

#### § § 1487.15

      (a) A Participant may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Participant for this purpose. The Participant must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.331 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Participant must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.

      (b) A Participant must include the following requirements in a subaward:

      (1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.

      (2) The subrecipient must pay to the Participant the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

      (3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

#### § § 1488.10

          (a) Commodities exported under a financing agreement must enter the destination country specified in the financing agreement.

          (b) For a financing agreement under which the financing period is in excess of 12 months, within 90 days, or such extension of time as may be granted in writing by the Assistant Sales Manager, following shipment from the United States of any agricultural commodity exported under the financing agreement, the exporter shall furnish to the office specified in § 1488.22, documentary evidence verifying entry of the commodity into the country of destination specified in the financing agreement. The documentary evidence must:

          (1) Identify the agricultural commodity (or permit identification through supplementary documents also furnished) as that exported under the financing agreement,

          (2) State the quantity and date of entry of the commodity into the destination country, and

          (3) Be signed by (i) a customs official of the destination country, or (ii) the importer, or (iii) a representative of an independent superintending or controlling firm.

          (c) When the commodity enters the country of destination in bond, a statement by the importer will be acceptable which:

          (1) Identifies the commodity as that exported under the financing agreement,

          (2) States the quantity of the commodity entered under bond and date of entry into the destination country, and

          (e) Failure to furnish, within the time specified, evidence of entry of the commodity into the country of destination shall constitute prima facie evidence of failure to enter or to cause the entry of the commodity into such country as required. In such case, the financing agreement may be terminated by the Assistant Sales Manager, and if full payment under the bank obligation or account receivable has not yet been received, the bank obligation and the account receivable shall at the option of CCC, become due and payable and liquidated damages shall be payable in accordance with § 1488.11. The remedy herein provided shall not be exclusive of other rights available to the Federal government if the commodity enters a country other than that specified in the financing agreement.

        Delivery Requirements

          § 1488.11   Liquidated damages.

#### § § 1488.11

          Failure of the exporter to export or cause to be exported, within the period provided therefor, any agricultural commodity financed, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, or failure of the exporter to enter or cause the entry of, such commodity into the country of destination, shall constitute a breach of the financing agreement which will result in serious and substantial damage to CCC and to its program. Since it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, the exporter shall pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable compensation and not as a penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of probable actual damages, as follows:

          (a) For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount financed;  That the aggregate of all amounts assessed under this § 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy.

          (a) U.S. banks and branch banks shall be liable without regard to risk (1) for payment of bank obligations issued by them or (2) for payment of bank obligations confirmed by them without regard to risk if a requirement for such confirmation is included in the financing agreement or (3) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

          (b) An obligation issued by a foreign bank must be confirmed and advised, as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, by a U.S. bank or a branch bank, or may be confirmed by an agency bank when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC.

          (c) A U.S. bank must confirm the full amount of an obligation issued by its foreign branch. CCC will hold the U.S. bank liable for payment without regard to risks.

          (d) If a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by its home office, or by another branch of its home office, it must confirm the full amount thereof. CCC will hold the branch bank liable for payment without regard to risks.

          (e) If CCC accepts an agency bank confirmation of a foreign bank obligation, it must be for the full amount thereof without regard to risks and will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the financing agreement. CCC will not accept an agency bank confirmation of an obligation issued by its home office, or by a branch of its home office.

          (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, if a U.S. bank or a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by a foreign bank, it must confirm at least 10 percent pro rata and must advise the remainder of the foreign bank obligation. The percentage of confirmation shall be the same for both the account receivable and the interest portions of the obligation. For the confirmed amount, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CCC will hold the U.S. bank or branch bank liable for commercial risks but not for non-commercial risks. For the advised amount, CCC will not hold the U.S. bank or branch bank liable for commercial or non-commercial risks. CCC will hold the foreign bank liable without regard to risks for all amounts not recovered from the U.S. or branch bank.

          (g) Under special circumstances, on application in writing, the Vice President, CCC, may reduce or waive requirements for 10 percent confirmation by a U.S. or branch bank, but a bank will not be relieved of any obligation it undertakes.

          (h) Any bank obligation which provides for a bank acceptance of a time draft by CCC (banker's acceptance) shall not be acceptable to CCC.

          (i) CCC will consent to cancellation or reduction of a bank obligation to the extent of any payment it receives from other sources or amounts otherwise payable under such bank obligation.

          (j) Collection of accounts receivable purchased under GSM-5 will be effected through the issuance by CCC of sight drafts against the bank obligations, but this method of collection shall not be exclusive of any other collection procedures or rights available to CCC.

#### § § 1488.13

          CCC will draw one draft for each payment due under bank obligations. If any portion of a CCC draft is dishonored, the U.S. bank or branch bank shall return the dishonored draft together with its statement of the reason for nonpayment. If a draft which is drawn under a partially confirmed bank obligation is dishonored, CCC will replace the draft with separate drafts for the confirmed and unconfirmed portions at the request of the confirming bank. Such replacement shall not alter the confirming bank's obligation for timely payment to CCC of the confirmed portion of the credit. For confirmed amounts, except as provided in § 1488.12(a), (c) and (d), a U.S. or branch bank may request refund from CCC of the amount paid if it certifies to CCC that it is unable to recover funds from the foreign bank due to a stipulated non-commercial risk which existed on the date payment was made to CCC under the draft. If CCC finds that inability to recover funds was due to such a non-commercial risk, the refund shall be promptly made together with interest at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount rate from and including the date payment was originally made to CCC but not include the date of refund by CCC. For unconfirmed amounts, remittance to CCC shall be considered final, and the U.S. bank or branch bank shall not thereafter have recourse to CCC.

The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable for which payment is assured by a bank obligation issued or confirmed for all risks according to § 1488.12(a)(ii) or pro rata confirmed by a U.S. bank shall be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable the payment of which is assured by a bank obligation issued or pro rata confirmed by a branch bank shall, when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest rates applicable to accounts receivable the payment of which is assured by an agency bank confirmation may, when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC, after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable.

#### § § 1488.15

          If, before expiration of the financing period, the exporter or the U.S. bank or the agency or branch bank accepts payment from or on behalf of the foreign importer of any part of the account receivable, it shall be remitted promptly to CCC.

#### § § 1488.16

          If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) submitted in accordance with § 1488.8, CCC will look to the obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any loss arising from breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or refund required by § 1488.15 and § 1488.18, together with interest thereon at the rate specified in the documents evidencing the account receivable, as well as for any liquidated damages provided for in § 1488.11.

#### § § 1488.18

For breach or violation of this warranty, CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC. Should the financing agreement be annulled, CCC will promptly consent to the reduction or cancellation or related bank obligations except for amounts outstanding under a financing agreement. Such amounts shall, on demand, be refunded to CCC by the exporter.

**Authority:** Authority: 15 U.S.C. 714c(f).

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 80094, Nov. 17, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

      § 1489.10   General purpose and scope.

#### § § 1489.10

      (a) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP), which subsumes the former Agricultural Trade Promotion Program (ATP). This program will provide assistance to eligible organizations that conduct market promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff barriers to trade, to promote U.S. agricultural commodities in certain foreign markets. Specific program requirements will be set forth in Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) announced through the  website.

      (b)(1) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations of general applicability issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), including the regulations set forth in chapter XXX of this title, may apply to the RAPP and RAPP Participants, to the extent that the regulations of general applicability in this paragraph (b)(1) do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The regulations include, but are not limited to:

      (i) 7 CFR part 1, subpart A.

      (ii) 7 CFR part 3.

      (iii) 7 CFR part 15, subpart A.

      (iv) 2 CFR part 417.

      (v) 2 CFR part 418.

      (vi) 2 CFR part 421.

      (vii) 48 CFR part 31.

      (2) In addition, relevant provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory provisions that are generally applicable to the CCC are also applicable to the RAPP and the regulations set forth in this part.

      (3) RAPP Participants must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and related civil rights regulations and policies.

      (4) Other laws and regulations that apply to the RAPP and RAPP Participants include, but are not limited to:

      (i) 2 CFR part 25.

      (ii) 2 CFR part 170.

      (iii) 2 CFR part 175.

      (iv) 2 CFR part 180.

      (v) 2 CFR part 200.

      (vi) 2 CFR part 400.

      (vii) 37 CFR 401.1.

      (viii) Executive Order 13224, as amended, “Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism.”

      (c) Under the RAPP, the CCC may provide multi-year grant assistance to eligible U.S. entities to conduct certain marketing and promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff trade barriers, aimed at developing, maintaining, or expanding commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. RAPP Participants may receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities. While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable activities may also take place in the United States. The CCC expects that all activities that occur in the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is sought will develop, maintain, or expand the commercial export market for the relevant eligible commodity in accordance with the RAPP Participant's approved RAPP program.

      (d) The RAPP generally operates on a reimbursement basis.

      (e) The CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by RAPP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue advantage. The CCC also endeavors to enter into RAPP agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The RAPP is administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of the CCC.

A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand ( a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market a commodity or product in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the RAPP Participant must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme ( a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.

      means the country or countries targeted by an activity.

      means a document from the RAPP Participant by which the RAPP Participant proposes to CCC changes to the activities and/or funding levels in an approved RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter.

      means the total time interval between the start of a RAPP award and the planned end date, which may include one or more funded portions, or budget periods. A RAPP award's period of performance will be defined by the dates contained in the program agreement.

      means a representative part of a larger whole promoted commodity or group of promoted commodities. _Product samples_ include all forms of a promoted commodity ( fresh or processed), independent of the ultimate utilization of the sample. Product samples must be used in support of international marketing activities including, but not limited to, displays, food process testing, cooking demonstrations, or trade and consumer tastings.

      means a document entered into between CCC and a RAPP Participant setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under RAPP, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.

      means an eligible commodity the sale of which is the intended result of a promotional activity.

      means the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program.

      means Regional Agricultural Promotion Program notices, which are documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These _RAPP notice_s are made available electronically on the FAS website. These notices have no legal effect. They are intended to alert RAPP Participants to various aspects of CCC's current administration of the RAPP program.

      or  means an entity that has entered into a RAPP program agreement with the CCC.

      means expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.

      means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to result in specific sales.

      means State Regional Trade Group. An _SRTG_ is a nonprofit association of State-funded agricultural promotion agencies.

      means a contractor, typically a consultant or other highly paid professional, that is hired on a short-term basis to assist in the performance of an activity.

      means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to promote the interests of an entire agricultural sector rather than to result in specific sales by any of its members.

      means a website maintained by FAS through which applicants may apply and are reimbursed for RAPP and other USDA market development programs. The website is currently accessible to persons with e-authentication certification at  FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to the RAPP and will announce such system in the applicable NOFO.

      means a standardized online internet application developed by USDA and available for use by entities to apply to USDA market development programs, including the RAPP.

      means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.

      means the United States Department of Agriculture.

      means a firm, association, or other entity organized or incorporated, located, and doing business for profit in the United States, and engaged in the export or sale of an eligible commodity.

#### § § 1489.13

      (a)  CCC will periodically issue a NOFO through the  website announcing that it is accepting applications for participation in the RAPP. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the NOFO and in this part. Applicants may apply to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program that provides RAPP funds to brand participants for brand promotion, as well as to conduct other market promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff trade barriers. An applicant that is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.

      (b)  CCC may request any information that it deems necessary to evaluate an application, including, but not limited to, performance measurement information. Applicants shall provide any requested information in the manner and according to the timeframe specified by CCC.

      (c)  CCC will consider proposals for demonstration projects, provided:

      (1) No more than one such demonstration project per constraint is undertaken within a market;

      (2) The constraint to be addressed in the target market is a lack of technical knowledge or expertise;

      (3) The demonstration project is a practical and cost-effective method of overcoming the constraint; and

      § 1489.14   Application review and formation of agreements.

#### § § 1489.14

      (a)  (1) CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate each eligible proposal against the factors described in the appropriate NOFO to identify those applications that it considers to best meet the criteria and objectives outlined in the NOFO. Based on its review and evaluation, CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to the appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating a proposal. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict-of-interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.

      (2) When considering applicant organizations, CCC may give priority to those organizations that have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted, as determined by CCC. CCC may require that an applicant participate in the RAPP through another RAPP Participant or applicant.

      (3) CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the NOFO.

      (4) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application.

      (b)  CCC will send a program agreement (or amendment to an existing program agreement), an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The program agreement or amendment and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a RAPP Participant's program, including any requirements with respect to contributions and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter must so indicate by having the appropriate personnel sign the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter and submit these to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter are signed by both parties.

      (c)  The RAPP Participant is encouraged to designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign program agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The RAPP Participant shall submit the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the RAPP Participant's Chief Executive Officer (or designee) to CCC. The Participant shall immediately notify CCC in writing of any changes in signatories and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.

      (d)  CCC will provide each RAPP Participant with IDs and passwords for the UES website, as necessary. RAPP Participants shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information, or when a person who is not authorized gains such information.

      (e)  A RAPP Participant through which U.S. for-profit entities are participating in the RAPP program shall obtain annual certifications from all such entities that certify their size, as defined in this part. The Participant shall retain these certifications in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of this part.

      (f) —(1)  (i) A RAPP Participant may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the RAPP Participant shall submit a notification to CCC.

      (ii) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description and the proposed budget.

      (iii) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the RAPP Participant via the UES website whether the requested budget is approved.

      (2)  (i) A RAPP Participant desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.

      (ii) A RAPP Participant may make significant adjustments below $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.

      (iii) Notifications shall describe the activity, changes to the activity, the existing funding level, the proposed funding level, and a justification for transfer of funds, if applicable.

      § 1489.15   Operational procedures for brand promotion programs.

#### § § 1489.15

      (a) Where CCC approves an application by a RAPP Participant to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the RAPP Participant shall establish brand program operational procedures. The RAPP Participant shall submit to CCC for approval its proposed brand program operational procedures. CCC will notify all RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of brand program operation procedures. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, a brand program application, application procedures, application review criteria, brand participant eligibility requirements, a participation agreement, reimbursement requirements, compliance requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, employment practices, financial management requirements, contracting procedures, and evaluation requirements. The RAPP Participant must submit to CCC for approval any proposed changes to already approved brand program operational procedures before implementing such proposed changes.

      (b) The RAPP Participant shall not enter into any participation agreements with brand participants, nor shall it implement any RAPP brand activities, unless and until CCC has communicated in writing its approval of the proposed operational procedures to the RAPP Participant.

      (c) Where CCC approves a RAPP Participant's application to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the RAPP Participant shall enter into participation agreements with brand participants. Brand participants' size may not exceed 300 percent of the applicable small business size standard as found in 13 CFR part 121. These agreements must:

      (1) Specify a time period for such brand promotion and require that all brand promotion expenditures be made within the RAPP Participant's approved budget period;

      (2) Make no allowance for extension or renewal;

      (3) Limit reimbursable expenditures to those made in countries and for activities approved in the brand participant's activity plan;

      (4) Specify the percentage of promotion expenditures that will be reimbursed, reimbursement procedures, and documentation requirements;

      (5) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it either owns the brand of the product it will promote or has exclusive rights to promote the brand in each of the countries in which promotion activities will occur;

      (6) Require that all product labels, promotional material, and advertising will identify the origin of the eligible commodity as “American”, “Product of the United States of America”, “Product of the U.S.”, “Product of the U.S.A.”, “Product of America”, “Grown in the United States of America”, “Grown in the U.S.”, “Grown in the U.S.A.”, “Grown in America”, “Made in the United States of America,” “Made in the U.S.”, “Made in the U.S.A.”, “Made in America”, or product of, grown in or made in any state or territory of the United States of America spelled out in its entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by the CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of   inch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter “o”. The use of the above terms as a descriptor or in the name of the product ( Cincinnati style chili, Gina's American Pizza) does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases “product of”, “grown in” or “made in” are encouraged, but not required. A RAPP Participant that wishes to use an origin statement that varies from those set out in this subsection must submit the proposed statement to CCC for review and must receive approval to use the statement before its use in an activity. A RAPP Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a case-by-case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to the CCC that the labeling requirement in this paragraph (c)(6) would hinder a RAPP Participant's promotional efforts. CCC will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the labeling requirement. In addition, the CCC may temporarily waive this requirement where the CCC has determined that such labeling will likely harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website;

      (7) Include a written certification by the brand participant that identifies its size on the date of its application for branded program funding, or that it is a U.S. agricultural cooperative;

      (8) Require that the brand participant submit to the RAPP Participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contributions to program activities; and

      (9) Require the brand participant to maintain all original records and documents relating to program activities for three calendar years following the end of the applicable budget period and make such records and documents available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

      § 1489.16   Contribution rules.

#### § § 1489.16

      (a) In RAPP generic promotion programs, a RAPP Participant shall contribute a total amount in goods, services, and/or cash equal to at least 10 percent of the value of resources provided by the CCC for all generic promotion activities undertaken by the RAPP Participant.

      (b) In RAPP brand promotion programs, a RAPP Participant conducting its own brand promotion or a brand participant that is participating in the RAPP brand promotion program of another RAPP Participant shall contribute at least 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures submitted in accordance with § 1489.17 made on each approved brand promotion.

      (c) A RAPP Participant must use its own funds and may not use RAPP program funds to pay any administrative costs of the RAPP Participant's U.S. office(s), including legal fees, except as set forth in this part.

      (xvii) Other administrative expenses ( supervisory travel from the U.S. to an overseas office); and

      (xviii) The cost of any activity expressly listed as reimbursable in this part.

      (3) The following are not eligible contributions:

      (iii) Any land costs other than allowable costs for office space;

      (iv) The cost of refreshments and related equipment provided to office staff;

      (v) The cost of insuring articles owned by private individuals;

      (x) Any expenditure for an activity prior to the CCC's approval of that activity.

      (4) The CCC shall determine, at the CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section may be included by the RAPP Participant as an eligible contribution.

      § 1489.17   Reimbursement rules.

#### § § 1489.17

      (a) A RAPP Participant may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

      (1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the accomplishment of an approved RAPP activity; and

      (2) The Participant has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

      (b) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, for either brand or generic promotion activities, the CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the costs of:

      (1) Production and placement of advertising, in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters, which may include advertising the availability of price discounts, except that advertising associated with a coupon or price discount for the RAPP-promoted product is not reimbursable. If advertising is related to both coupons or price discounts for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products as well as for RAPP-promoted products, then expenditures for such advertising will not be reimbursed in whole or in part ( expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement). Electronic media include, but are not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, social media, and podcasting.

      (2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and other similar point of sale materials.

      (3) Direct mail advertising.

      (6) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States.

      (7) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows, whether held outside or inside the United States, including participation fees, booth construction, transportation of related materials, rental of space and equipment, and duplication of related printed materials. However, with regard to non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States, such expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is: a food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and, an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from outside the U.S. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is available, and such list will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website.

      (8) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for no more than two representatives of a single brand participant (or RAPP Participant directly running its own brand program) to exhibit their company's (or cooperative's) products at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States. Representatives may include employees and board members of private companies, employees or members of cooperatives, or any broker, consultant, or marketing representative contracted by the company or cooperative to represent the company or cooperative in sales transactions. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route.

      (9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the RAPP Participant.

      (10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, in-store promotions, food service promotions, and trade seminars.

      (11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:

      (i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and

      (ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the consumer, or other target audience, purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item.

      (12) The design and production of packaging, labeling or origin identification, to be used during the budget period in which the expenditure is made, if such packaging, labeling or origin identification is necessary to meet the importing requirements of a foreign country.

      (13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products as well as for RAPP-promoted products, then expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part ( expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement).

      (i) Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the RAPP Participant's UES;

      (ii) The trade mission included representatives, as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, from a minimum of five different companies (or cooperatives), and no more than two representatives from each participating company (or cooperative);

      (iii) The appropriate FAS overseas office supported the trade mission by dedicating meaningful funding or other resources (such as facilities or staff time) to the activity; and

      (iv) The RAPP Participant with the approved brand program produced an itinerary or agenda for the trade mission that demonstrated that company (or cooperative) representatives would be engaged for a minimum of 6 hours per day (except for the first and last days of the mission) in trade mission activities that include, at a minimum, each of the following:

      (A) A product showcase where the FAS overseas office approved an invitation list of qualified buyers;

      (B) Pre-arranged one-on-one business meetings; and

      (C) Evaluation and feedback sessions with FAS staff and trade mission sponsors.

      (v) Reimbursement is conditional on the RAPP Participant having notified in writing the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel to that country or region. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route.

      (18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade and consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, RAPP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those RAPP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Upon written request, the CCC may temporarily waive this subsection, on a case-by-case basis, where:

      (i) The trade show is segregated into product pavilions; or

      (ii) A company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the RAPP Participant in writing.

      (19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a RAPP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience ( a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the RAPP Participant's domestic home office during a budget period, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same budget period are not reimbursable.

      (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, but for generic promotion activities only, the CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

      (1) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except the CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross salary of a GS-15, Step 10 for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate.

      (2) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas, and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, then international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: a food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and, an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the United States. The CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is available, and such list will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website.

      (i) The CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the RAPP Participant fails to notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel to that country or region, unless the CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notice. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the RAPP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date, and the RAPP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.

      (ii) In limited circumstances, the RAPP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate ( a premium class rate other than the first class rate) upon prior written approval by the CCC. Such circumstances are:

      (A) Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare, and the RAPP Participant receives written documentation from its travel agent to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;

      (B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; and

      (C) If an eligible traveler is an employee, contractor, or member of a RAPP participant organization, and the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days ( weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.

      (D) If an eligible traveler is the target of a market development activity ( a foreign buyer, foreign importer, member of the foreign media), then the RAPP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate when the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds five hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days ( weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.

      (iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances noted in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, the CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either  or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses.

      (iv) A stopover for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another.

      (v) All travel under this paragraph (c)(2) should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel. An eligible traveler that is the target of a market development activity is only eligible for a rest period when that traveler flies in economy class and meets the 14-hour test.

      (3) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status.

      (4) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200.

      (5) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for RAPP activities or for RAPP-funded travel of third-party participants, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the RAPP Participant's policy and sound business practice.

      (6) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market.

      (7) Legal fees incurred in resolving trade issues with foreign countries.

      (8) The sample purchase price, and the cost of transporting samples domestically in the United States to the port of export and then to the first foreign port or first point of entry, for samples of eligible commodities used to provide on-site technical assistance to the trade necessary to facilitate successful use of the relevant eligible commodity by importers. The target of such activity must be the trade, and not consumers, but any product resulting from the technical training can be used to determine consumer preferences.

      (9) STRE incurred outside of the United States and STRE incurred within the United States in conjunction with an approved activity where the STRE has a programmatic purpose and are authorized with prior written approval from the CCC. RAPP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions incurred outside of the United States as the basis for their calculating eligible expenses. RAPP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines by up to 25 percent without prior approval. RAPP Participants may only exceed 125 percent of Embassy guidelines when they have received written authorization from the FAS Agricultural Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed 125 percent of the guidelines will not be reimbursed. RAPP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines and this part. For STRE incurred in the United States, the RAPP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses.

      (10) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the RAPP, for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

      (11) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the RAPP, for any RAPP Participants not identified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section, will be considered, except for agricultural cooperatives. Reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed eight percent of the RAPP Participant's total RAPP budget. The level of such funding will be established by CCC in the approval letter.

      (12) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States.

      (13) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for international retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States upon prior written approval by CCC. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is: a food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the host country. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website.

      (14) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States.

      (15) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for up to two individuals, whether home office RAPP Participant employees, RAPP Participant board members, or State department of agriculture employees paid by the RAPP Participant, or a combination thereof, when such individuals accompany foreign trade missions or technical teams while traveling in the United States where the following conditions are met:

      (i) Such trade missions or technical team visits are identified in the RAPP Participant's UES;

      (ii) Such trade missions or technical team visits have been approved by CCC; and

      (iii) The RAPP-sponsored travelers submit a follow-up trip report to CCC that includes the following:

      (A) Purpose for the individuals' participation;

      (B) Any pre-arranged business meetings;

      (C) Itinerary and/or agenda for the trip; and

      (D) Feedback from sponsors and trade mission/technical team members on the success of the trip.

      (16) Approved demonstration projects.

      (17) Expenditures related to copyright, trademark, or patent registration, including attorney fees.

      (18) Rental or lease expenditures for storage space for program-related materials.

      (19) Business cards that target a foreign audience.

      (20)(i) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that:

      (A) Contain a message related to exporting or international trade;

      (B) Include a discernible “link” to the FAS website or an FAS overseas office website; and

      (C) Have been specifically approved by the appropriate FAS division. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable.

      (ii) Reimbursement claims for websites that include “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access.

      (21) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending non-tariff barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities. Examples of such expenditures include, but are not limited to: initial pre-clearance programs, educational training, policy advocacy, public relations efforts, foreign country audits of U.S. facilities, export protocol and work plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database development, and reasonable logistical and administrative support.

      (22) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, and fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the RAPP Participant's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office.

      (23) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for, capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones and wireless devices).

      (24) Compensation and allowances for housing and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:

      (i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or

      (ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel.

      (25) Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas, subject to the following limitations:

      (26) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change.

      (27) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law.

      (28) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved RAPP-funded overseas offices.

      (1) Forward year financial obligations, such as severance pay, attributable to employment of foreign nationals;

      (2) Expenses, fines, settlements, or judgments relating to legal suits, challenges or disputes, except as otherwise allowed in 2 CFR part 200 and this part;

      (8) Rental, lease or purchase of warehouse space, except for storage space for program-related material;

      (9) Coupon redemption or price discounts of the RAPP promoted commodity;

      (e) For a brand promotion activity, the CCC will reimburse no more than 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures made on that activity by a brand participant.

      (f) The CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a RAPP Participant's period of performance, provided:

      (1) The activity was completed prior to the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement; and

      (2) All expenditures for the activity were made within 6 months following the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement.

      (i) The CCC may determine, at the CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.

      § 1489.18   Reimbursement procedures.

#### § § 1489.18

      (a) Participants are required to use the CCC's UES system to request reimbursement for eligible expenditures under RAPP.

      (b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the RAPP Participant's U.S. office to the CCC through the UES system.

      (c) [Reserved]

      (d) The CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement.

      (e) If the CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, then the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment within 30 calendar days of the date that they discover, or are made aware, of any overpayment. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.

      (f) If a RAPP Participant receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment that is later disallowed, the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC within 30 days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.

      (g) RAPP funds may be expended by RAPP Participants only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the program agreement and approval letter. If a RAPP Participant discovers that RAPP funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify the CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars.

      (h) The RAPP Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to CCC.

      § 1489.19   Advances.

#### § § 1489.19

      (a)  In general, the CCC operates the RAPP on a reimbursable basis.

      (b)  A RAPP Participant may request an advance of RAPP funds from the CCC for generic promotion activities, provided the RAPP Participant meets the criteria for advance payments in 2 CFR part 200. The CCC will not approve any request for an advance submitted after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement. At any given time, total payments advanced shall not exceed 40 percent of a RAPP Participant's approved generic activity budget for the budget period. The CCC will not advance funds to a RAPP Participant for brand promotion activities. When approving a request for an advance, the CCC may require the RAPP Participant to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered by the CCC to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the RAPP. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, the Participant's history of performance in RAPP; the Participant's perceived financial stability and resources; and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Participant's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.

      (c)  A RAPP Participant shall deposit and maintain in an insured bank account in the United States all funds advanced by the CCC. The account shall be interest-bearing unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the RAPP Participant on funds advanced by the CCC is not program income. The RAPP Participant shall remit any interest earned on the advanced funds to the appropriate entity as set forth in 2 CFR part 200.

      (d)  A RAPP Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved generic promotion activities within 90 calendar days after the date the advance was approved in the UES. By the end of the 90 calendar days, the RAPP Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance or submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.

      § 1489.20   Financial management.

#### § § 1489.20

      (a) A RAPP Participant shall implement and maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles. A RAPP Participant's financial management system shall comply with the standards in 2 CFR part 200.

      (b) A RAPP Participant shall institute internal controls and provide written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities to ensure their compliance with this part.

      (c) A RAPP Participant shall retain all records concerning a RAPP program transaction for a period of three years after completion of the program transaction and permit the CCC to have full and complete access to such records during the transaction period and for such three-year period after completion of the program transaction. These records shall include all records pertaining to contractors.

      (d) A RAPP Participant shall maintain its records of expenditures and contributions in a manner that allows it to provide information by activity plan, country, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall include:

      (1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);

      (2) Original receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a set amount that CCC will determine and announce in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The CCC may, from time to time, set a different minimum amount. In that case, the CCC will announce the new amount in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website;

      (3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;

      (4) Copies of reimbursement claims;

      (5) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the RAPP Participant's CCC resources accounts;

      (6) Documentation with accompanying English translation supporting each reimbursement claim, including original evidence to support the financial transactions such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, contracts or purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, and credit memos; and

      (7) Documentation supporting contributions. These must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution; who conducted the activity; the participating groups or individuals; and the method of computing the claimed contributions. RAPP Participants must retain and make available for compliance review documentation related to claimed contributions.

      (e) Upon request, a RAPP Participant shall provide to the CCC originals of documents supporting reimbursement claims.

      § 1489.21   Reports.

#### § § 1489.21

      (a)  Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report that identifies, by cost category and in U.S. dollar equivalent, contributions made by the Participant, the applicable U.S. industry, and the States during the Participant's RAPP period of performance. Foreign third-party contributions are not to be included in the contribution report.

      (b)  Not later than 45 days after completion of travel (other than local travel), a RAPP Participant shall electronically submit a trip report. The report must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.

      (c)  Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved RAPP program.

      (d)  Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report on any evaluations conducted in accordance with the approved RAPP program, including the outcome of action taken with RAPP funding and the increased market access or exports that can be directly attributed to the RAPP program.

      (e)  Where the CCC is designated the cognizant agency for audit, the CCC may require the RAPP Participant to submit to the CCC an annual audit in accordance with 2 CFR part 200. If the CCC requires an additional audit with respect to a particular agreement, then the RAPP Participant shall arrange for such audit and shall submit to the CCC, in the manner to be specified by the CCC, such audit of the agreement.

      (f)  The CCC may require the submission of additional reports.

      (g)  A RAPP Participant's program agreement and/or approval letter shall specify to whom the Participant shall submit the reports required in this section.

      (h)  FAS, through its authorized representatives, may review project accomplishments, management control systems, and administration of funding provided through the program to ensure adherence to the requirements in this part. During such reviews, FAS will review recipients' files related to the grant-funded program, and technical assistance may be required.

      § 1489.22   Evaluation.

#### § § 1489.22

      (a)(1) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the RAPP. Evaluation of the RAPP's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by Participants of goals to be met within a specified time, schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for achievement, and assessment of results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the RAPP and of individual Participants' programming is to increase sales that would not have occurred in the absence of RAPP funding. A RAPP Participant that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Participant's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.

      (2) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a RAPP Participant's program, contributing to program accountability and providing evidence of program effectiveness that directly ties program funds to increased sales.

      (b) All RAPP Participants must report annual results against their target market and/or regional constraint/opportunity performance measures. These are outcome results usually based on multiple activities and should demonstrate progress made in the market during the latest budget period. This report shall be completed and submitted to the CCC no later than 6 months following the end of each Participant's budget period.

      (c) When deemed appropriate or required by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall complete a program evaluation. A program evaluation is a review of the RAPP Participant's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the RAPP Participant and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the RAPP Participant's strategy in meeting specified goals. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the RAPP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter. A RAPP Participant shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations, as well as any proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation. A program evaluation shall contain:

      (1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;

      (2) The scope of the evaluation;

      (3) A concise statement of the market constraint(s)/opportunity(ies) and the goals specified in the approved strategic plan;

      (4) A description of the evaluation methodology;

      (5) A description of export sales achieved;

      (6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and

      (7) Recommendations for future programs.

      (d) When deemed appropriate or required by the CCC, RAPP Participants conducting a branded program must also complete a brand promotion evaluation. A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the activity achieved the goals specified in the approved RAPP program. Actual scope and timing of the brand promotion evaluation shall be determined by the RAPP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter.

      (e) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall complete and submit program success stories. The CCC will announce to all RAPP Participants in writing the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.

      § 1489.23   Compliance reviews and notices.

#### § § 1489.23

      (a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of RAPP Participants' activities under the RAPP program. RAPP Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews.

      (b) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the RAPP Participant. The compliance report will specify whether USDA staff believe that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and/or it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the program agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The compliance report will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. Within 60 calendar days of the date the compliance report cover letter is signed, the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC. If, however, a RAPP Participant notifies the CCC within 60 calendar days of the date the compliance report cover letter is signed that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then the amount owed to the CCC by the RAPP Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and the CCC has made a final written determination as to the amount owed. If, as a result of a compliance review, the CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of RAPP, then the CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.

      (c) In addition, the CCC may notify a RAPP Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. The CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The RAPP Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC. If, however, a RAPP Participant notifies the CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then the amount owed to the CCC by the RAPP Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and the CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.

      (d) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a RAPP Participant is in compliance with its program agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.

      (e) For appeals:

      (1) A RAPP Participant may, within 60 calendar days of the date of the compliance report or written notice from the CCC, submit a written response to the CCC appealing the report or notice. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.

      (2) After review of the Participant's response, the CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to the CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. The CCC will initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to Debt Settlement Policies and Procedures, 7 CFR part 3.

      (3) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination, the Participant may request in writing that the CCC reconsider the determination and shall submit in writing the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.

      (4) If the Participant requests a hearing, the CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, the CCC may in its discretion have a transcript prepared at the CCC's expense.

      (5) The CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by the CCC.

      § 1489.24   Failure to make required contribution.

#### § § 1489.24

      A RAPP Participant's required contribution will be specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a dollar amount and the RAPP Participant does not contribute a total dollar amount sufficient to make the required contribution, then the RAPP Participant shall pay to the CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by the CCC and the RAPP Participant does not provide a dollar amount of contributions sufficient to achieve the specified percentage, then the RAPP Participant may either return to the CCC the amount of funds reimbursed by the CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to the CCC in U.S. dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A RAPP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.

      § 1489.25   Submissions.

#### § § 1489.25

      For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this part shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by the CCC.

      § 1489.26   Disclosure of program information.

#### § § 1489.26

      (a) Documents submitted to CCC by RAPP Participants are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, specifically § 1.12.

      (b) Any research conducted by a RAPP Participant pursuant to a RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.

      § 1489.27   Ethical conduct.

#### § § 1489.27

      (a) A RAPP Participant shall conduct its business in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which an activity is carried out and in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. A RAPP Participant shall conduct its business in the United States in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. All RAPP Participants must comply with the regulations in 2 CFR part 200 and this part.

      (b) Except for a U.S. agricultural cooperative or a U.S. for-profit entity, neither a RAPP Participant nor its _affiliate_s shall make export sales of eligible commodities covered under the terms of the applicable RAPP agreement. Nor shall such entities charge a fee for facilitating an export sale. A RAPP Participant may, however, collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the RAPP Participant. For the purposes of this paragraph (b),  means any partnership, association, company, corporation, trust, or any other such party in which the Participant has an investment other than in a mutual fund.

      (c) A RAPP Participant shall not limit participation in its RAPP activities to members of its organization. Participants shall ensure that their RAPP-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors. The RAPP Participant shall publicize its program and make participation possible for commercial entities throughout the relevant commodity sector or, in the case of SRTGs, throughout the corresponding region. This includes providing to such commercial entities, upon request, a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its RAPP agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating and distributing the materials. This paragraph (c) does not apply to any U.S. agricultural cooperative when implementing its own brand program.

      (d) A RAPP Participant shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in generic RAPP activities such as trade teams, sales teams, and trade fairs based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall submit such selection criteria to the CCC for approval.

      (e) All RAPP Participants should endeavor to ensure fair and accurate fact-based advertising. Deceptive or misleading promotions may result in cancellation or termination of a Participant's RAPP agreement and the recovery of CCC funds related to such promotions from the Participant.

      (f) The RAPP Participant must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of its RAPP program to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and its U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to the CCC.

      § 1489.28   Contracting procedures.

#### § § 1489.28

      (a) Neither the CCC nor any other agency of the U.S. Government nor any official or employee of the CCC, FAS, USDA, or the U.S. Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to RAPP Participant contracts with third parties.

      (b) A RAPP Participant shall comply with the procurement standards set forth in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section when procuring goods and services and when engaging in construction to implement program agreements.

      (c) Each RAPP Participant shall establish contracting procedures, for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with RAPP funds, that are open, fair, and competitive.

      (d) Each RAPP Participant shall submit to the CCC, for CCC approval, written contracting guidelines for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with RAPP funds. The CCC will notify all new and existing RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of contracting guidelines. The CCC's approval of such contracting guidelines will remain in place until the CCC retracts its approval in writing, or until new guidelines are approved that supersede them. Once approved by the CCC, these contracting guidelines shall govern all of a Participant's RAPP-funded contracting involving contracts with a minimum annual value that CCC will determine and announce in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The CCC may, from time to time, set a different minimum value. In that case, the CCC will announce the new amount in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The guidelines shall indicate the method for evaluating proposals received for all contract competitions, the method for monitoring and evaluating performance under contracts, and the method for initiating corrective action for unsatisfactory performance under contracts. The RAPP Participant may modify and resubmit these guidelines for re-approval at any time. In addition to the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, these guidelines shall include, at a minimum, the following:

      (1) Procedures for developing and publicizing requests for proposals, invitations for bids, and similar documents that solicit third party offers to provide goods or services. Solicitations for professional and technical services shall be based on clear and accurate descriptions of and requirements related to the services to be procured. Such procedures must include a conflict-of-interest provision that states that no employee, officer, board member, or agent thereof of the RAPP Participant will participate in the review, selection, award or administration of a contract if a real or apparent conflict of interest would arise. Such a conflict would arise when an employee, official, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated in this paragraph (d)(1), has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. Procedures shall provide that officers, employees, board members, and agents thereof shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors. Procedures shall also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, board members or agents thereof;

      (2) Procedures for reviewing proposals, bids, or other offers to provide goods and services. Separate procedures shall be developed for various situations, including, but not limited to: solicitations for highly technical services; solicitations for services that are not common in a specific market; solicitations that yield receipt of three or more bids; solicitations that yield receipt of fewer than three bids;

      (3) Requirements to conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, and/or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement. RAPP Participants' written contracting guidelines may detail special situations where the prohibitions in this subparagraph do not apply, such as in situations involving highly specialized technical services or situations where the services are not commonly offered in a specific market;

      (4) Requirements to perform and document in the procurement files some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices in connection with every procurement action that is governed by the contracting guidelines;

      (5) Requirements to conduct an appropriate form of competition every three years on all multi-year contracts that are governed by the contracting guidelines. However, contracts for in-country representation are not required to be re-competed after the initial award. Instead, the performance of in-country representation must be evaluated and documented by the RAPP Participant annually to ensure that the terms of the contract are being met in a satisfactory manner; and

      (6) Requirements for written contracts with each provider of goods, services, or construction work. Such contracts shall require such providers to maintain adequate records to account for funds provided to them by the RAPP Participant.

      (e) A RAPP Participant may undertake RAPP promotional activities directly or through a domestic or foreign third party. However, the RAPP Participant shall remain responsible and accountable to the CCC for all RAPP promotional activities and related expenditures undertaken by such third party and shall be responsible for reimbursing CCC for any funds that CCC determines should be refunded to the CCC in relation to such third party's promotional activities and expenditures.

      § 1489.29   Property standards.

#### § § 1489.29

      The RAPP Participant shall insure all RAPP-funded property and equipment acquired in furtherance of program activities and safeguard such against theft, damage and unauthorized use. The Participant shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of property to the insurance company.

      § 1489.30   Anti-fraud requirements.

#### § § 1489.30

      (a)  (1) All RAPP Participants shall submit to the CCC for approval a detailed fraud prevention program. The CCC will notify all new and existing RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of fraud prevention programs. RAPP Participants should review their fraud prevention programs annually. The fraud prevention program shall, at a minimum, include an annual review of physical controls and weaknesses, a standard process for investigating and remediation of suspected fraud cases, and training in risk management and fraud detection for all current and future employees. The RAPP Participant shall not conduct or permit any RAPP promotion activities to occur unless and until the CCC has communicated in writing approval of the RAPP Participant's fraud prevention program.

      (2) The RAPP Participant, within five business days of receiving an allegation or information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of misrepresentation or fraud that could give rise to a claim by CCC, shall report such allegation or information in writing to such USDA personnel as specified in the Participant's RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter. The RAPP Participant shall cooperate fully in any USDA investigation of such allegation or occurrence of misrepresentation or fraud and shall comply with any directives given by the CCC or USDA to the RAPP Participant for the prompt investigation of such allegation or occurrence.

      (b)  (1) The RAPP Participant may charge a fee to brand participants to cover the cost of the fraud prevention program.

      (2) The RAPP Participant shall repay to the CCC funds paid to a brand participant through the RAPP Participant on claims that the RAPP Participant or the CCC subsequently determines are unauthorized or otherwise non-reimbursable expenses within 30 days of the RAPP Participant's determination or CCC's disallowance. The RAPP Participant shall repay CCC by submitting a check to CCC or by offsetting the RAPP Participant's next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. A RAPP Participant operating a brand program in strict accordance with an approved fraud prevention program, however, will not be liable to reimburse CCC for RAPP funds paid on such claims if the claims were based on misrepresentations or fraud of the brand participant, its employees or agents, unless the CCC determines that the RAPP Participant was grossly negligent in the operation of the brand program regarding such claims. The CCC shall communicate any such determination to the RAPP Participant in writing.

      § 1489.31   Program income.

#### § § 1489.31

      Any revenue or refunds generated from an activity,  participation fees, proceeds of sales, refunds of value added taxes (VAT), the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with RAPP funds, shall be used by the RAPP Participant in furtherance of its approved RAPP activities in the budget period during which the RAPP funds are available for obligation by the RAPP Participant. The use of such revenue or refunds shall be governed by this part. Interest earned on funds advanced by the CCC is not program income.

      § 1489.32   Amendment.

#### § § 1489.32

      A program agreement may be amended in writing with the written consent of the CCC and the RAPP Participant.

      § 1489.33   Noncompliance with an agreement or this part.

#### § § 1489.33

      If a RAPP Participant fails to comply with any term in its program agreement or approval letter, or this part, the CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the RAPP Participant, following the procedures set forth in this part. The CCC may also initiate a claim against a RAPP Participant if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the RAPP Participant.

      § 1489.34   Suspension, termination, and closeout of agreements.

#### § § 1489.34

      A program agreement may be suspended or terminated in accordance with the suspension and termination procedures in 2 CFR part 200. If an agreement is terminated, the applicable regulations in 2 CFR part 200 will apply to the closeout of the agreement.

      § 1489.35   Paperwork reduction requirements.

#### § § 1489.35

      The paperwork and record keeping requirements imposed by this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The control number for this information collection is 0551-0049.

        The following definitions will apply to this part, and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:

        are defined by the State's FRPP or equivalent, or where no program exists. _Agricultural uses_ should be defined by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS finds that a State definition of agriculture is so broad that an included use could lead to the degradation of soils and agriculture productivity, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property than allowable under that State definition of agriculture in order to protect agricultural use and related conservation values.

        means an eligible entity that NRCS has determined to meet the requirements of § 1491.4(d) of this part.

        means the _Chief_ of NRCS or designee.

        § 1491.4   Program requirements.

#### § § 1491.4

        (a) Under FRPP, the Chief, on behalf of the CCC, will facilitate and provide funding for the purchase of conservation easements or other interests in eligible land that is subject to a pending offer from an eligible entity for the purpose of protecting the agricultural use and related conservation values of the land by limiting non-agricultural uses of the land. Eligible entities submit applications to NRCS State offices to partner with NRCS to acquire conservation easements on farm and ranch land. NRCS enters into cooperative agreements with selected entities and provides funds for up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the easement. In return, the eligible entity agrees to acquire, hold, manage, and enforce the easement. A Federal right of enforcement must also be included in each FRPP funded easement deed for the protection of the Federal investment.

        (b) The term of all easements or other interests in land will be in perpetuity unless prohibited by State law. In States that limit the term of the easement or other interest in land, the term of the easement or other interest in land must be the maximum allowed by State law.

        (c) To be eligible to receive FRPP funding, an Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization must meet the definition of eligible entity as listed in § 1491.3. In addition, eligible entities interested in receiving FRPP funds must demonstrate:

        (1) A commitment to long-term conservation of agricultural lands;

        (2) A capability to acquire, manage, and enforce easements;

        (3) Sufficient number of staff dedicated to monitoring and easement stewardship; and

        (4) The availability of funds.

        (d) To be considered for certification, an entity must submit a written request for certification to NRCS, and must:

        (1) Meet the requirements identified in paragraph (c) of this section;

        (2) Use or agree to use for FRPP funded acquisitions, the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice or the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions in conducting appraisals;

        (3) Hold, manage, and monitor a minimum of 25 agricultural land conservation easements, unless the entity requests and receives a waiver of this requirement from the Chief;

        (4) Hold, manage, and monitor a minimum of five FRPP or Farmland Protection Program conservation easements;

        (5) Have the demonstrated ability to complete acquisition of easements in a timely fashion;

        (6) Have the capacity to enforce the provisions of easement deeds;

        (7) For nongovernmental organizations, possess a dedicated fund for the purposes of easement management, monitoring, and enforcement where such fund is sufficiently capitalized in accordance with NRCS standards. The dedicated fund must be dedicated to the purposes of managing, monitoring, and enforcing each easement held by the eligible entity;

        (8) Be willing to adjust procedures to ensure that the conservation easements acquired meet FRPP purposes and are enforceable; and

        (9) Have a plan for administering easements enrolled under this part, as determined by the Chief.

        (e) NRCS will notify an entity in writing whether they have been certified and the rationale for the agency's decision. Once NRCS determines an entity qualifies as certified:

        (1) NRCS will enter into a cooperative agreement with the certified entity through which NRCS may obligate funding for up to 5 years. New parcels or prior-year unfunded parcels submitted for funding by certified entities must compete for funding each year. Selected parcels and funding will be added to the existing cooperative agreement using an amendment to the cooperative agreement. Funding expiration dates for the added parcels will be in the amendment to the cooperative agreement;

        (2) NRCS will accept applications from certified entities continuously throughout the fiscal year;

        (3) Certified entities may elect to close easements without NRCS approving the conservation easement deeds, titles, or appraisals before closing;

        (4) Certified entities will prepare the conservation easement deeds, titles, and appraisals according to NRCS requirements as identified in the cooperative agreement;

        (5) NRCS will conduct quality assurance reviews of a percentage of the conservation easement transactions submitted by the certified entity for payment. The review will include whether the deed, title review, or appraisals were conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth by NRCS in its certification of the eligible entity or in the cooperative agreement entered into with the certified entity; and

        (6) If a certified entity closes on the easement without a pre-closing NRCS review, and the conservation easement deed, title, or appraisal fails the NRCS quality assurance review, NRCS will provide the certified entity an opportunity to correct the errors. If the certified entity fails to correct the errors to NRCS satisfaction, NRCS may consider decertification of the entity in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (f)  (1) The Chief will conduct a review of the certified entity a minimum of once every 3 years to ensure that the certified entities are meeting the certification criteria established in § 1491.4(d).

        (2) If the Chief finds that the certified entity no longer meets the criteria in § 1491.4(d), the Chief will:

        (i) Allow the certified entity a specified period of time, at a minimum 180 days, in which to take such actions as may be necessary to correct the identified deficiencies, and

        (ii) If the State Conservationist has determined the certified entity does not meet the criteria established in § 1491.4(d) after the 180 days, the State Conservationist will send, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notice of proposed decertification of the entity's certification status or eligibility for future FRPP funding. This notice will contain what actions have not been completed to retain certification status, what actions the entity must take to request certification status, the status of funds in the cooperative agreement, and the eligibility of the entity to apply for future FRPP funds. The entity may contest the Notice of Decertification in writing to the State Conservationist within 20 calendar days of receipt of the notice of proposed decertification.

        (3) The period of decertification may not exceed 3 years in duration, with duration of decertification based upon the seriousness of the facts; and

        (4) The entity may be recertified upon application to NRCS, after the decertification period has expired, and when the entity has met the requirements as outlined under § 1491.4(d).

        (g) Eligible land:

        (1) Must be privately owned land on a farm or ranch and contain at least 50 percent prime, unique, statewide, or locally important farmland, unless otherwise determined by the State Conservationist; contain historical or archaeological resources; furthers a State or local policy consistent with the purposes of the program; and is subject to a pending offer by an eligible entity;

        (2) Must be cropland, rangeland, grassland, pastureland, or forest land that contributes to the economic viability of an agricultural operation or serves as a buffer to protect an agricultural operation from development;

        (3) May include land that is incidental to the cropland, rangeland, grassland, pastureland, or forest land if the incidental land is determined by the Secretary to be necessary for the efficient administration of a conservation easement;

        (4) May include parts of or entire farms or ranches;

        (5) Must not include forest land of greater than two-thirds of the easement area. Land with contiguous forest that exceeds the greater of 40 acres or 20 percent of the easement area will have a forest management plan before closing, unless the Chief has reviewed and approved an alternative means by which the forest land's contribution to the economic viability of the land has been demonstrated;

        (6) NRCS will not provide FRPP funds for the purchase of an easement or other interest in land on land owned in fee title by an agency of the United States, a State or local government, or by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values, including those listed in the statute under eligible land, or land that is already subject to an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to non-agricultural use;

        (7) Must be owned by landowners who certify that they do not exceed the adjusted gross income limitation eligibility requirements set forth in part 1400 of this title;

        (8) Must possess suitable onsite and offsite conditions which will allow the easement to be effective in achieving the purposes of the program. Unsuitable conditions may include, but are not limited to, hazardous substances on or in the vicinity of the parcel, land use surrounding the parcel that is not compatible with agriculture, and highway or utility corridors that are planned to pass through or immediately adjacent to the parcel; and

        (9) May be land on which gas, oil, earth, or other mineral rights exploration has been leased or is owned by someone other than the applicant and may be offered for participation in the program. However, if an applicant submits an offer for an easement project, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) will assess the potential impact that the third party rights may have upon achieving the program purposes. USDA reserves the right to deny funding for any application where there are exceptions to clear title on any property.

        (h) Prior to closing, the value of the conservation easement must be appraised. Appraisals must be completed and signed by a State-certified general appraiser and must contain a disclosure statement by the appraiser. The appraisal must conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices or the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, as selected by the eligible entity. State Conservationists will provide the guidelines through which NRCS will review appraisals for quality assurance purposes. Entities must provide a copy of the appraisal to NRCS.

        (i) The landowner will be responsible for complying with the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 (1985 Act), as amended and 7 CFR part 12.

        (j) The entity may substitute acres within a pending offer. Substituted acres must not decrease the value of the offered easement or the value of the parcel in meeting program purposes. With the State Conservationist's approval, a cooperating entity may substitute pending offers within their cooperative agreement. The landowner and parcel must meet eligibility criteria as described in § 1491.4(e). The State Conservationist may require re-ranking of substituted acres and substituted parcels.

        § 1491.5   Application procedures.

#### § § 1491.5

        (a) An Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization will submit an application to the State Conservationist in the State where parcels are located.

        (b) The State Conservationist will determine whether the Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization is eligible to participate in FRPP based on the criteria set forth in § 1491.4(c).

        (c) The Chief will determine whether an eligible entity is a certified entity based on the criteria set forth in § 1491.4(d), information provided by the application, and data in the national FRPP database.

        (d) The State Conservationist will notify each Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization if it has been determined eligible, certified, or ineligible.

        (e) Eligible entities with cooperative agreements entered into after the effective date of this part will not have to resubmit an annual application for the duration of the cooperative agreement. Entities may reapply for eligibility when their cooperative agreements expire.

        (f) Throughout the fiscal year, eligible entities may submit to the appropriate State Conservationist applications for parcels, in that State, with supporting information to be scored, ranked, and considered for funding.

        (g) At the end of each fiscal year, the lists of pending, unfunded parcels will be cancelled unless the eligible entity requests that specific parcels be considered for funding in the next fiscal year. Entities must submit a new list of parcels each fiscal year in order to be considered for funding unless they request that parcels from the previous fiscal year be considered.

        § 1491.6   Ranking considerations and proposal selection.

#### § § 1491.6

        (a) Before the State Conservationist can score and rank the parcels for funding, the eligibility of the landowner and the land must be assessed.

        (b) The State Conservationist will use national and State criteria to score and rank parcels. The national ranking criteria will be established by the Chief, and the State criteria will be determined by the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee. The national criteria will comprise at least half of the ranking system score.

        (c) At least 30 days before the ranking of parcels, the State Conservationist will announce the date on which ranking of parcels will occur. A State Conservationist may announce more than one date of ranking in a fiscal year.

        (d) All parcels submitted throughout the fiscal year will be scored. All parcels will be ranked together in accordance with the national and State ranking criteria before parcels are selected for funding.

        (e) The parcels selected for funding will be listed on the agreements of the entities that submitted the parcels, and the agreements will be signed by the State Conservationist and the eligible entity. Funds for each fiscal year's parcels will be obligated with a new signature each year on an amendment to the agreement. Parcels funded on each fiscal year's amendment will have a separate deadline for closing and requesting reimbursement.

        (f) The national ranking criteria are:

        (1) Percent of prime, unique, and important farmland in the parcel to be protected;

        (2) Percent of cropland, pastureland, grassland, and rangeland in the parcel to be protected;

        (3) Ratio of the total acres of land in the parcel to be protected to average farm size in the county according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture;

        (4) Decrease in the percentage of acreage of farm and ranch land in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;

        (5) Percent population growth in the county as documented by the United States Census;

        (6) Population density (population per square mile) as documented by the most recent United States Census;

        (7) Proximity of the parcel to other protected land, such as military installations, land owned in fee title by the United States or an Indian Tribe, State government or local government, or by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values, or land that is already subject to an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to non-agricultural use;

        (8) Proximity of the parcel to other agricultural operations and infrastructure; and

        (9) Other additional criteria as determined by the Chief.

        (g) State or local criteria as determined by the State Conservationist, with advice of the State Technical Committee, may include:

        (1) The location of a parcel in an area zoned for agricultural use;

        (2) The performance of an eligible entity's experience in managing and enforcing easements. Performance must be measured by the closing efficiency or percentage of parcels that have been monitored and the percentage of monitoring results that have been reported. The number of years of an eligible entity's existence, budget, or staffing level will not be used as a ranking factor;

        (3) Multifunctional benefits of farm and ranch land protection including social, economic, historical and archaeological, and environmental benefits;

        (4) Geographic regions where the enrollment of particular lands may help achieve national, State, and regional conservation goals and objectives, or enhance existing government or private conservation projects;

        (5) Diversity of natural resources to be protected;

        (6) Score in the Land Evaluation and Site Assessment system. This score serves as a measure of agricultural viability (access to markets and infrastructure); and

        (7) Existence of a farm or ranch succession plan or similar plan established to encourage farm viability for future generations.

        (h) State ranking criteria will be developed on a State-by-State basis. The State Conservationist will make available a full listing of applicable national and State ranking criteria.

      Subpart B—Cooperative Agreements and Conservation Easement Deeds

        § 1491.20   Cooperative agreements.

#### § § 1491.20

        (a) NRCS, on behalf of the CCC, will enter into a cooperative agreement with entities selected for funding. Once a proposal is selected by the State Conservationist, the eligible entity must work with the State Conservationist to finalize and sign the cooperative agreement, incorporating all necessary FRPP requirements. The cooperative agreement must address:

        (1) The interests in land to be acquired, including the United States' right of enforcement, as well as the form and other terms and conditions of the easement deed;

        (2) The management and enforcement of the rights on lands acquired with FRPP funds;

        (3) The responsibilities of NRCS;

        (4) The responsibilities of the eligible entity on lands acquired with FRPP funds;

        (5) The allowance of parcel substitution upon mutual agreement of the parties; and

        (6) Other requirements deemed necessary by NRCS to meet the purposes of this part or protect the interests of the United States.

        (b) The term of cooperative agreements will be 5 years for certified entities and 3 years for other eligible entities.

        (c) The cooperative agreement will include an attachment listing the parcels accepted by the State Conservationist. This list will include landowners' names and addresses, acreage, the estimated fair market value, the estimated Federal contribution, and other relevant information. The cooperative agreement template will be made available by the State Conservationist.

        (d) The cooperative agreement will incorporate the provisions necessary for the eligible entity to comply with applicable registration and reporting requirements of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended) and 2 CFR parts 25 and 170.

        § 1491.21   Funding.

#### § § 1491.21

        (a) Subject to the statutory limits, the State Conservationist, in coordination with the eligible entity, will determine the NRCS share of the cost of purchasing a conservation easement or other interest in the land.

        (b) NRCS may provide up to 50 percent of the appraised fair market value of the conservation easement consistent with § 1491.4(g). An eligible entity will share in the cost of purchasing a conservation easement in accordance with the limitations of this part.

        (c) A landowner may make donations toward the acquisition of the conservation easement.

        (d) The eligible entity must provide a minimum of 25 percent of the purchase price of the conservation easement.

        (e) FRPP funds may not be used for expenditures such as appraisals, surveys, title insurance, legal fees, costs of easement monitoring, and other related administrative and transaction costs incurred by the eligible entity.

        (f) NRCS will conduct its technical and administrative review of appraisals and its hazardous materials reviews with FRPP funds.

        (g) If the State Conservationist determines that the purchase of two or more conservation easements are comparable in achieving FRPP goals, the State Conservationist will not assign a higher priority to any one of these conservation easements solely on the basis of lesser cost to FRPP.

        (h) Environmental Services Credits:

        (1) NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in environmental credits that may result from or be associated with an FRPP easement;

        (2) NRCS retains the authority to ensure that the requirements for FRPP-funded easements are met and maintained consistent with this part; and

        (3) If activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a FRPP easement, landowners are encouraged to request a compatibility assessment from the eligible entity prior to entering into such agreements.

        § 1491.22   Conservation easement deeds.

#### § § 1491.22

        (a) Under FRPP, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity with which NRCS has entered into an FRPP cooperative agreement. The easement will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with FRPP goals and objectives for the term of the easement.

        (b) Pending offers by an eligible entity must be for acquiring an easement in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent easement. In such cases where State law limits the term of a conservation easement, the easement term will be for the maximum allowed under State law.

        (c) The eligible entity may use its own terms and conditions in the conservation easement deed, but the conservation easement deed must be reviewed and approved by National Headquarters in advance of use. Individual conservation easement deeds used by the eligible entity will be submitted to National Headquarters at least 90 days before the planned closing date. Eligible entities with multiple parcels in a cooperative agreement may submit a conservation easement deed template for review and approval. The deed templates must be reviewed and approved by National Headquarters in advance of use. For eligible entities that have not been certified, the NRCS State offices will review prior to closing the conservation easement deeds for individual parcels to ensure that they contain the same language as approved by the national office and that the appropriate site-specific information has been included. NRCS reserves the right to require additional specific language or to remove language in the conservation easement deed to protect the interests of the United States. The Chief may exercise the option to promulgate standard minimum conservation deed requirements as a condition for receiving FRPP funds.

        (d) The conveyance document must include a right of enforcement clause. NRCS will specify the terms for the right of enforcement clause to read as set forth in the FRPP cooperative agreement. This right is a vested property right and cannot be condemned by State or local government.

        (e) As a condition for participation, a conservation plan will be developed by NRCS in consultation with the landowner and implemented according to the FOTG. NRCS may work through the local conservation district in the development of the conservation plan. The conservation plan will be developed and managed in accordance with the 1985 Act, 7 CFR part 12 or subsequent regulations, and other requirements as determined by the State Conservationist. To ensure compliance with this conservation plan, the easement will grant to the United States, through NRCS, its successors or assigns, a right of access to the easement area.

        (f) The eligible entity will acquire, hold, manage, and enforce the easement. The eligible entity may have the option to enter into an agreement with governmental or private organizations to carry out easement stewardship responsibilities.

        (g) NRCS will sign an acceptance of the conservation easement, concurring with the terms of the conservation easement and accepting its interest in the conservation easement deed.

        (h) All conservation easement deeds acquired with FRPP funds must be recorded. Proof of recordation will be provided to NRCS by the eligible entity.

        (i) Impervious surfaces will not exceed 2 percent of the FRPP easement area, excluding NRCS-approved conservation practices. The State Conservationist may waive the 2 percent impervious surface limitation on a parcel-by-parcel basis, provided that no more than 10 percent of the easement area is covered by impervious surfaces. Before waiving the 2 percent limitation, the State Conservationist must consider, at a minimum, population density, the ratio of open prime other important farmland versus impervious surfaces on the easement area, the impact to water quality concerns in the area, the type of agricultural operation, and parcel size. Eligible entities may submit an impervious surface limitation waiver process to the State Conservationist for review and consideration. The eligible entities must apply approved impervious surface limitation waiver processes on a parcel-by-parcel basis. State Conservationists will not approve blanket waivers of the impervious surface limitation for all parcels administered by the eligible entity without regard for the characteristics of individual parcels. All FRPP easements must include language limiting the amount of impervious surfaces within the easement area.

        (j) The conservation easement deed must include an indemnification clause requiring the landowner to indemnify and hold harmless the United States from any liability arising from or related to the property enrolled in FRPP.

        (k) The conservation easement deed must include an amendment clause requiring that any changes to the easement deed after its recordation must be consistent with the purposes of the conservation easement and this part. The conservation easement deed must require that NRCS approve any substantive amendment.

      Subpart C—General Administration

        § 1491.30   Violations and remedies.

#### § § 1491.30

        (a) In the event of a violation of the easement terms, the eligible entity will notify the landowner. The landowner may be given reasonable notice and, where appropriate, an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation in accordance with the terms of the conservation easement.

        (b) In the event that the eligible entity fails to enforce any of the terms of the conservation easement as determined by the Chief, the Chief or his or her successors or assigns may exercise the United States' rights to enforce the terms of the conservation easement through any and all authorities available under Federal or State law.

        (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS, upon notification to the landowner, reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to monitor conservation plan implementation or remedy deficiencies or easement violations as it relates to the conservation plan. The entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when the actions are deemed necessary to protect highly erodible soils and wetland resources. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred by NRCS as a result of the landowner's negligence or failure to comply with the easement requirements as it relates to conservation plan violations.

        (d) The United States will be entitled to recover any and all administrative and legal costs from the participating eligible entity, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action as it relates to the enforcement of the FRPP easement.

        (e) In instances where an easement is terminated or extinguished, NRCS will collect CCC's share of the conservation easement based on the appraised fair market value of the conservation easement at the time the easement is extinguished or terminated. The CCC's share will be in proportion to its percentage of original investment.

        (f) In the event NRCS determines it must exercise its rights identified under a conservation easement or other interest in land, NRCS will provide written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the eligible entity at the eligible entity's last known address. The notice will set forth the nature of the noncompliance by the eligible entity and a 60-day period to cure. If the eligible entity fails to cure within the 60-day period, NRCS will take the action specified under the notice. NRCS reserves the right to decline to provide a period to cure if NRCS determines that imminent harm may result to the conservation values or other interest in land it seeks to protect.

        § 1491.31   Appeals.

#### § § 1491.31

        (a) A person or eligible entity which has submitted an FRPP proposal and is therefore participating in FRPP, may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility for participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR part 614.

        (b) Before a person or eligible entity may seek judicial review of any administrative action taken under this part, the person or eligible entity must exhaust all administrative appeal procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and for the purposes of judicial review, no decision will be a final agency action except a decision of the Chief under these provisions.

        (c) Enforcement action undertaken by NRCS in furtherance of its vested property rights are under the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court and not subject to review under administrative appeal regulations.

        § 1491.32   Scheme or device.

#### § § 1491.32

        (a) If it is determined by NRCS that a eligible entity has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program payment otherwise due or paid to such an eligible entity during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded, with interest, as determined appropriate by NRCS on behalf of the CCC.

        (b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, and depriving any other person or entity of payments for easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which a person would otherwise not be entitled.

      Subpart B—CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) Operations

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 68596, Nov. 18, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1493.10   General statement.

#### § § 1493.10

        (a)  The Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was developed to expand U.S. Agricultural Commodity exports by making available Payment Guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. Agricultural Commodities on credit terms. The Payment Guarantee issued under GSM-102 is an agreement by CCC to pay the Exporter, or the U.S. Financial Institution that may take assignment of the Payment Guarantee, specified amounts of principal and interest in case of default by the Foreign Financial Institution that issued the Letter of Credit for the export sale covered by the Payment Guarantee. Under the GSM-102 program, maximum repayment terms may vary based on risk of default, as determined by CCC. The program operates in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales and is targeted toward those countries that have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this program, CCC seeks to expand and/or maintain market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for U.S. Agricultural Commodities.

        (b)  The GSM-102 program is administered under the direction of the General Sales Manager and Vice President of CCC, pursuant to this subpart, subpart A, and any Program Announcements issued by CCC. From time to time, CCC may issue a notice to participants on the USDA Web site to remind participants of the requirements of the GSM-102 program or to clarify the program requirements contained in these regulations in a manner not inconsistent with this subpart and subpart A. Program information, such as eligible U.S. Agricultural Commodities and approved U.S. and Foreign Financial Institutions, is available on the USDA Web site.

        (c)  From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement on the USDA Web site to announce a GSM-102 program for a specific country or region. The Program Announcement for a country or region will designate specific U.S. Agricultural Commodities or products thereof, or designate that all eligible U.S. Agricultural Commodities are available under the announcement. The Program Announcement will contain any requirements applicable to that country or region as determined by CCC.

        § 1493.20   Definition of terms.

#### § § 1493.20

        (b) An application for a Payment Guarantee may be approved as submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the Exporter, or rejected by the Director. In the event that the application is approved, the Director will cause a Payment Guarantee to be issued in favor of the Exporter. Such Payment Guarantee will become effective at the time specified in § 1493.100(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application will not be approved.

        § 1493.80   Certification requirements for obtaining Payment Guarantee.

#### § § 1493.80

        By providing the statement in § 1493.70(a)(18), the Exporter is certifying that the information provided in the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been met. The Exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do not include this statement. If the Exporter makes false certifications with respect to a Payment Guarantee, CCC will have the right, in addition to any other rights provided under this subpart or otherwise as a matter of law, to revoke guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the Exporter. The Exporter, in submitting an application for a Payment Guarantee and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.70(a)(18), certifies that:

        (a) The commodity or product covered by the Payment Guarantee is a U.S. Agricultural Commodity;

        (b) There have not been any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and the transaction complies with applicable United States law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (c) If the U.S. Agricultural Commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;

        (d) At the time of submission of the application for Payment Guarantee, neither the Importer nor the Intervening Purchaser, if applicable, is present as an excluded party on the SAM list;

        (e) The Exporter is fully in compliance with the requirements of § 1493.130(b) for all existing Payment Guarantees issued to the Exporter or has requested and been granted an extension per § 1493.130(b)(3); and

        (f) The information provided pursuant to § 1493.30 has not changed and the Exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.30.

        § 1493.90   Special requirements of the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit and the Terms and Conditions Document, if applicable.

#### § § 1493.90

        (a)  (1) A Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit is required in connection with the export sale to which CCC's Payment Guarantee pertains.

        (i) The Letter of Credit must stipulate presentation of at least one original clean on board bill of lading as a required document, unless:

        (A) The Exporter, or a related company previously reported to CCC by the Exporter pursuant to § 1493.30(a)(5), is named as the shipper on the clean on board bill of lading. If the Exporter or a related company is named the shipper on the bill of lading, the Letter of Credit may stipulate a copy or photocopy of an original clean on board bill of lading; or

        (B) The Letter of Credit stipulates presentation of electronic documents per paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (ii) If the Letter of Credit will allow for presentation of electronic documents, the Letter of Credit must so stipulate.

        (2) The use of a Terms and Conditions Document is optional. The Terms and Conditions Document, if any, must be specifically identified and referred to in the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit.

        (3) The special requirements in paragraph (b) of this section must be documented in one of the two following ways:

        (i) The special requirements may be set forth in the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit as a special instruction from the Foreign Financial Institution; or

        (ii) The special requirements may be set forth in a separate Terms and Conditions Document.

        (b)  The following provisions are required and must be documented in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) The terms of the Repayment Obligation, including a specific promise by the Foreign Financial Institution issuing the Letter of Credit to pay the Repayment Obligation;

        (2) The following language: “In the event that the Commodity Credit Corporation (“CCC”) is subrogated to the position of the obligee hereunder, this instrument shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of laws principles. In such case, any legal action or proceeding arising under this instrument will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, as determined by CCC, and such parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.”;

        (3) A provision permitting the Holder of the Payment Guarantee to declare all or any part of the Repayment Obligation, including accrued interest, immediately due and payable, in the event a payment default occurs under the Letter of Credit or, if applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document; and

        (4) Post Default Interest terms.

        § 1493.100   Terms and requirements of the Payment Guarantee.

#### § § 1493.100

        (a)  The Payment Guarantee will provide that CCC agrees to pay the Holder of the Payment Guarantee an amount not to exceed the Guaranteed Value, plus Eligible Interest, in the event that the Foreign Financial Institution fails to pay under the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit and, if applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.

        (b)  (1) The Holder of the Payment Guarantee may, with respect to a series of shipments made within a 30 calendar day period, elect to have the Payment Guarantee coverage being on the Weighted Average Export Date for such shipments. The first allowable 30 calendar day period for bundling of shipments to compute the Weighted Average Export Date for such shipments begins on the first Date of Export for transactions covered by the Payment Guarantee. Shipments within each subsequent 30 calendar day period may be bundled with other shipments made within the same 30 calendar period to determine the Weighted Average Export Date for such shipments.

        (2)(i) The period of coverage under the Payment Guarantee begins on the earlier of the following dates and will continue during the credit term specified on the Payment Guarantee or any amendments thereto:

        (A) The Date(s) of Export or the Weighted Average Export Date(s), as selected by the Holder of the Payment Guarantee consistent with paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or

        (B) The date when Ordinary Interest begins to accrue, or the weighted average date when interest begins to accrue.

        (ii) However, the Payment Guarantee becomes effective on the Date(s) of Export of the U.S. Agricultural Commodities specified in the Exporter's application for the Payment Guarantee.

        (c)  The terms of CCC's coverage will be set forth in the Payment Guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any Program Announcements and notices to participants in effect at the time the Payment Guarantee is approved by CCC.

        (d)  The final date to export shown on the Payment Guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the contractual deadline for shipping.

        (e)  The Exporter may apply for a Payment Guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee fee, based on the mean of the lower and upper loading tolerances of the Firm Export Sales Contract; however, the Exporter may also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified in the Firm Export Sales Contract. The amount of coverage that can be reserved to accommodate the upward loading tolerance is limited to ten (10) percent of the Port Value of the sale. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and the Director determines to make such reservation, CCC will so indicate to the Exporter. In the event that the Exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (i.e., the mean of the upper and lower loading tolerances), it may obtain the additional coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an application for amendment to the Payment Guarantee, and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such application for an amendment to the Payment Guarantee is not filed with CCC by the Exporter and the additional fee not received by CCC within 30 calendar days after the date of the last export against the Payment Guarantee, CCC may cancel the reserve coverage originally set aside for the Exporter.

        (f)  (1) An export sale (or any portion thereof) is ineligible for Payment Guarantee coverage if at any time CCC determines that:

        (1) The commodity is not a U.S. Agricultural Commodity;

        (2) The export sale includes corrupt payments or extra sales or services or other items extraneous to the transactions provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the export sale;

        (3) The export sale does not comply with applicable U.S. law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (4) If the U.S. Agricultural Commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable oil product, any of the agricultural commodity or product has been or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;

        (5) Either the Importer or the Intervening Purchaser, if any, is excluded or disqualified from participation in U.S. government programs; or

        (6) The sale is not an Eligible Export Sale.

        (g)  The following exports are ineligible for coverage under a GSM-102 Payment Guarantee except where it is determined by the Director to be in the best interest of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such exports:

        (1) Exports of U.S. Agricultural Commodities with a Date of Export prior to the date of receipt by CCC of the Exporter's written application for a Payment Guarantee;

        (2) Exports of U.S. Agricultural Commodities with a Date of Export later than the final date to export shown on the Payment Guarantee or any amendments thereof;

        (3) Exports of U.S. Agricultural Commodities where the date of issuance of a Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit is later than 30 calendar days after:

        (i) The Date of Export, or

        (ii) The Weighted Average Export Date, if the Holder of the Payment Guarantee has elected to have the Payment Guarantee coverage begin on the Weighted Average Export Date; or

        (4) Exports of U.S. Agricultural Commodities that have been guaranteed by CCC under another Payment Guarantee. If CCC determines that an export of U.S. Agricultural Commodities has been guaranteed under multiple Payment Guarantees (or coverage has been requested under multiple Payment Guarantees), CCC will determine which Payment Guarantee (or application for Payment Guarantee), if any, corresponds to an Eligible Export Sale.

        (h)  The Payment Guarantee may contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or desirable by the Director. Such additional terms, conditions or qualifications as stated in the Payment Guarantee are binding on the Exporter and the Assignee.

        (i)  A request for an amendment of a Payment Guarantee may be submitted only by the Exporter, with the written concurrence of the Assignee, if any. The Director will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable Program Announcements and sufficient budget authority exists. Any amendment to the Payment Guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the Payment Guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. CCC reserves the right to request additional information from the Exporter to justify the request and to charge a fee for amendments. Such fees will be announced and available on the USDA Web site. Any request to amend the Foreign Financial Institution on the Payment Guarantee will require that the Holder of the Payment Guarantee resubmit to CCC the certifications in § 1493.120(c)(1)(i) or § 1493.140(d).

        § 1493.110   Guarantee fees.

#### § § 1493.110

        (a)  Payment Guarantee fee rates charged may be one of the following two types:

        (1) Those that are announced on the USDA Web site and are based upon the length of the payment terms provided for in the Firm Export Sales Contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by CCC, and any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for consideration.

        (2) Those where Exporters are invited to submit a competitive bid for coverage. If CCC determines to offer coverage on a competitive fee bid basis, instructions for bidding, and minimum fee rates, if applicable, will be made available on the USDA Web site.

        (b)  The guarantee fee will be computed by multiplying the Guaranteed Value by the guarantee fee rate.

        (c)  The Exporter shall remit, with his application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not be accepted until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The Exporter's wire transfer or check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and be submitted in the manner specified on the USDA Web site.

        (d)  Guarantee fees paid in connection with applications that are accepted by CCC will ordinarily not be refundable. Once CCC notifies an Exporter of acceptance of an application, the fee for that application will not be refunded unless the Director determines that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC, even if the Exporter withdraws the application prior to CCC's issuance of the Payment Guarantee. If CCC does not accept an application for a Payment Guarantee or accepts only part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee will be made.

        § 1493.120   Assignment of the Payment Guarantee.

#### § § 1493.120

        (a)  The Exporter may assign the Payment Guarantee only to a U.S. Financial Institution approved for participation by CCC. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the Payment Guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be:

        (1) Made to one party acting for two or more parties, or

        (2) Subject to further assignment.

        (b)  A notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed with CCC by the Assignee in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. The name and address of the Assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment. The notice of assignment should be received by CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of assignment.

        (c)  (1) The U.S. Financial Institution must include the following certification on the notice of assignment: “I certify that:

        (i) [Name of Assignee] has verified that the Foreign Financial Institution, at the time of submission of the notice of assignment, is not present as an excluded party on the SAM list; and

        (ii) To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided pursuant to § 1493.40 has not changed and [name of Assignee] still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.40.”

        (2) If the Assignee makes a false certification with respect to a Payment Guarantee, CCC may, in its sole discretion, in addition to any other action available as a matter of law, rescind and cancel the Payment Guarantee, reject the assignment of the Payment Guarantee, and/or commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the Assignee.

        (d)  In cases where a U.S. Financial Institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to the U.S. Financial Institution and to the Exporter issued the Payment Guarantee.

        (e)  A U.S. Financial Institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of a Payment Guarantee or the proceeds payable under a Payment Guarantee if such U.S. Financial Institution:

        (1) At the time of assignment of a Payment Guarantee, is not in compliance with all requirements of 1493.40(a); or

        (2) Is the branch, agency, or subsidiary of the Foreign Financial Institution issuing the Letter of Credit; or

        (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the Foreign Financial Institution issuing the Letter of Credit; or

        (4) Is the U.S. parent of the Foreign Financial Institution issuing the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit; or

        (5) Is owned or controlled by the government of a foreign country and the Payment Guarantee has been issued in connection with export sales of U.S. Agricultural Commodities to Importers located in such foreign country.

        (f)  (1) The Holder of the Payment Guarantee may enter into a Repurchase Agreement, to which the following requirements apply:

        (i) Any repurchase under a Repurchase Agreement by the Holder of the Payment Guarantee must be for the entirety of the outstanding balance under the associated Repayment Obligation;

        (ii) In the event of a default with respect to the Repayment Obligation subject to a Repurchase Agreement, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee must immediately effect such repurchase; and

        (iii) The Holder of the Payment Guarantee must file all documentation required by §§ 1493.160 and 1493.170 in case of a default by the Foreign Financial Institution under the Payment Guarantee.

        (2) The Holder of the Payment Guarantee shall, within five Business Days of execution of a transaction under the Repurchase Agreement, notify CCC of the transaction in writing in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. Such notification must include the following information:

        (i) Name and address of the other party to the Repurchase Agreement;

        (ii) A statement indicating whether the transaction executed under the Repurchase Agreement is for a fixed term or if it is terminable upon demand by either party. If fixed, provide the purchase date and the agreed upon date for repurchase. If terminable on demand, provide the purchase date only; and

        (iii) The following written certification: “[Name of Holder of the Payment Guarantee] has entered into a Repurchase Agreement that meets the provisions of 7 CFR 1493.120(f)(1) and, prior to entering into this agreement, verified that [name of other party to the Repurchase Agreement] is not present as an excluded party on the SAM list.”

        (3) Failure of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee to comply with any of the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section may result in CCC annulling coverage on the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit and Terms and Conditions Document, if applicable, covered by the Payment Guarantee.

        § 1493.130   Evidence of export.

#### § § 1493.130

        (a)  The Exporter is required to provide CCC an evidence of export report for each shipment made under the Payment Guarantee. This report must include the following information:

        (1) Payment Guarantee number;

        (2) Evidence of export report number (e.g., Report 1, Report 2) reflecting the report's chronological order of submission under the particular Payment Guarantee;

        (3) Date of Export;

        (4) Destination country or region. If the sale was registered under a regional program, the Exporter must indicate the specific country or countries within the region to which the goods were shipped;

Where the unit sales price at export differs from the unit sales price indicated in the Exporter's application for a Payment Guarantee, the Exporter is also required to submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference;

        (10) Description and value of Discounts and Allowances, if any;

        (11) The Exporter's statement, “All certifications set forth in 7 CFR 1493.140 are hereby being made by the Exporter in this Evidence of Export.” which, when included in the evidence of export by the Exporter, will constitute a certification that it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in § 1493.140; and

        (12) In addition to all of the above information, the final evidence of export report for the Payment Guarantee must include the following:

        (i) The statement “Exports under the Payment Guarantee have been completed.”

        (ii) A statement summarizing the total quantity and value of the commodity exported under the Payment Guarantee (i.e., the cumulative totals on all numbered evidence of export reports).

        (b)  (1) The Exporter must provide a written report to the CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site within 30 calendar days of the Date of Export.

        (2) If at any time the Exporter determines that no shipments are to be made under a Payment Guarantee, the Exporter is required to notify CCC in writing no later than the final date to export specified on the Payment Guarantee by furnishing the Payment Guarantee number and stating “no exports will be made under the Payment Guarantee.”

        (3) Requests for an extension of the time limit for submitting an evidence of export report must be submitted in writing by the Exporter to the Director and must include an explanation of why the extension is needed. An extension of the time limit may be granted if such extension is requested prior to the expiration of the time limit for filing and is determined by the Director to be in the best interests of CCC.

        (c)  CCC will not accept any new applications for Payment Guarantees from an Exporter under § 1493.70 until the Exporter is fully in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for all existing Payment Guarantees issued to the Exporter or has requested and been granted an extension per paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (d)  Exporters have a mandatory reporting responsibility under Section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5712), for exports of certain agricultural commodities and products thereof.

        § 1493.140   Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

#### § § 1493.140

        By providing the statement contained in § 1493.130(a)(11), the Exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been met. The Exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the Exporter makes false certifications with respect to a Payment Guarantee, CCC will have the right, in addition to any other rights provided under this subpart or otherwise as a matter of law, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the Exporter. The Exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.130(a)(11), certifies that:

        (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the Payment Guarantee is a U.S. Agricultural Commodity;

        (b) The U.S. Agricultural Commodity was shipped directly to the country or region specified on the Payment Guarantee;

        (c) There have not been any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the export sale, and that the export sale complies with applicable United States law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (d) If the Exporter has not assigned the Payment Guarantee to a U.S. Financial Institution, the Exporter has verified that the Foreign Financial Institution, at the time of submission of the evidence of export report, is not present as an excluded party on the SAM list;

        (e) The transaction is an Eligible Export Sale; and

        (f) The information provided pursuant to §§ 1493.30 and 1493.70 has not changed (except as agreed to and amended by CCC) and the Exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.30.

        § 1493.150   Proof of entry.

#### § § 1493.150

        (a)  The diversion of U.S. Agricultural Commodities covered by a Payment Guarantee to a country or region other than that shown on the Payment Guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Director.

        (b)  (1) Exporters must obtain and maintain records of an official or customary commercial nature that demonstrate the arrival of the U.S. Agricultural Commodities exported in connection with the GSM-102 program in the country or region that was the intended country or region of destination of such commodities. At the Director's request, the Exporter must submit to CCC records demonstrating proof of entry. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the importing country, by an agent or representative of the vessel or shipline that delivered the U.S. Agricultural Commodity to the importing country, or by a private surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed acceptable by the Director showing:

        (i) That the U.S. Agricultural Commodity entered the importing country or region;

        (ii) The identification of the export carrier;

        (iii) The quantity of the U.S. Agricultural Commodity;

        (iv) The kind, type, grade and/or class of the U.S. Agricultural Commodity; and

        (v) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the U.S. Agricultural Commodity in the importing country or region.

        (2) Where shipping documents (e.g., bills of lading) clearly demonstrate that the U.S. Agricultural Commodities were shipped to the destination country or region, proof of entry verification may be provided by the Importer.

        § 1493.160   Notice of default.

#### § § 1493.160

        (a)  If the Foreign Financial Institution issuing the Letter of Credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Credit or the Terms and Conditions Document, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not later than 5 Business Days after the date that payment was due from the Foreign Financial Institution (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in writing to CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site and must include the following information:

        (1) Payment Guarantee number;

        (2) Name of the country or region as shown on the Payment Guarantee;

        (3) Name of the defaulting Foreign Financial Institution;

        (4) Payment due date;

        (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately the amounts for principal and Ordinary Interest, and including a copy of the repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and Ordinary Interest rates for each installment;

        (6) Date of the Foreign Financial Institution's refusal to pay, if applicable;

        (7) Reason for the Foreign Financial Institution's refusal to pay, if known, and copies of any correspondence with the Foreign Financial Institution regarding the default.

        (b)  If the Holder of the Payment Guarantee fails to notify CCC of a default within 5 Business Days, CCC may deny the claim for that default.

        (c)  (1) In the event that a Foreign Financial Institution defaults under a Repayment Obligation, CCC may declare that such Foreign Financial Institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the GSM-102 Program. If CCC determines that such defaulting Foreign Financial Institution is no longer eligible for the GSM-102 Program, CCC shall provide written notice of such ineligibility to all Exporters and Assignees, if any, having Payment Guarantees covering transactions with respect to which the defaulting Foreign Financial Institution is expected to issue a Letter of Credit. Receipt of written notice from CCC that a defaulting Foreign Financial Institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the GSM-102 Program shall constitute withdrawal of coverage of that Foreign Financial Institution under all Payment Guarantees with respect to any Letter of Credit issued on or after the date of receipt of such written notice. CCC will not withdraw coverage of the defaulting Foreign Financial Institution under any Payment Guarantee with respect to any Letter of Credit issued before the date of receipt of such written notice.

        (2) If CCC withdraws coverage of the defaulting Foreign Financial Institution, CCC will permit the Exporter (with concurrence of the Assignee, if any) to utilize another approved Foreign Financial Institution, and will consider other requested amendments to the Payment Guarantee, for the balance of the export sale covered by the Payment Guarantee. If no alternate Foreign Financial Institution is identified to issue the Letter of Credit within 30 calendar days, CCC will cancel the Payment Guarantee and refund the Exporter's guarantee fees corresponding to any unutilized portion of the Payment Guarantee.

        § 1493.170   Claims for default.

#### § § 1493.170

        (a)  A claim by the Holder of the Payment Guarantee for a defaulted payment will not be paid if it is made later than 180 calendar days from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim must be submitted in writing to CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. The claim must include the following documents and information:

        (1) An original cover document signed by the Holder of the Payment Guarantee and containing the following information:

        (i) Payment Guarantee number;

        (ii) A description of:

        (A) Any payments from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the defaulted payment that were received by the Exporter or the Assignee prior to submission of the claim; and

        (B) Any security, insurance, or collateral arrangements, whether or not any payment has been realized from such security, insurance, or collateral arrangement as of the time of claim, from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the defaulted payment.

        (iii) The following certifications:

        (A) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been received, listing separately scheduled principal and Ordinary Interest;

        (B) A certification of the amount of the defaulted payment, indicating separately the amounts for defaulted principal and Ordinary Interest;

        (C) A certification that all documents submitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section are true and correct copies; and

        (D) A certification that all documents conforming with the requirements for payment under the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit have been submitted to the negotiating bank or directly to the Foreign Financial Institution under such Letter of Credit.

        (2) An original instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee to the amount of payment in default under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the applicable Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit and, if applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document; and

        (3) A copy of each of the following documents:

        (i) The repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and Ordinary Interest rates for each installment (if the Ordinary Interest rates for future payments are unknown at the time the claim for default is submitted, provide estimates of such rates);

        (ii)(A) The Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit securing the export sale; and

        (B) If applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document;

        (iii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the ocean carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, or, if shipped by rail or truck, the bill of lading and the entry certificate or similar document signed by an official of the importing country. If the transaction utilizes electronic bill(s) of lading (e-BL), a print-out of the e-BL from electronic system with an electronic signature is acceptable;

        (iv)(A) The Exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FCA, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or

        (B) If there was an Intervening Purchaser, both the Exporter's invoice to the Intervening Purchaser and the Intervening Purchaser's invoice to the Importer;

        (v) The evidence of export report(s) previously submitted by the Exporter to CCC in conformity with the requirements of § 1493.130(a); and

        (vi) If the defaulted payment was part of a transaction executed under a Repurchase Agreement, written evidence that the repurchase occurred as required under § 1493.120(f)(1)(ii).

        (b)  If a claim is denied by CCC, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee may provide further documentation to CCC to establish that the claim is in good order.

        (c)  If the initial claim is found in good order, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating to failure of the Foreign Financial Institution to make scheduled installments on the same export shipment, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated in paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) and (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.

        (d)  CCC may establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a Payment Guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the Payment Guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.

        § 1493.180   Payment for default.

#### § § 1493.180

        (a)  Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under § 1493.170, CCC will determine whether or not a default has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable Payment Guarantee. Such determination shall include, but not be limited to, CCC's determination that all documentation conforms to the specific requirements contained in this subpart, and that all documents submitted for payment conform to the requirements of the Letter of Credit and, if applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document. If CCC determines that it is liable to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee, CCC will pay the Holder of the Payment Guarantee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  CCC's maximum liability for any claims submitted with respect to any Payment Guarantee, not including any CCC Late Interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:

        (1) The Guaranteed Value as stated in the Payment Guarantee, plus Eligible Interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the Exporter or the Assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the Exporter or the Assignee); or

        (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the Payment Guarantee) of the Exported Value indicated in the evidence of export, plus Eligible Interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the Exporter or the Assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the Exporter or the Assignee).

        (c)  If CCC does not pay a claim within 15 Business Days of receiving the claim in good order, CCC Late Interest will accrue in favor of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee beginning with the sixteenth Business Day after the day of receipt of a complete and valid claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. CCC Late Interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be calculated at a rate equal to the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date CCC Late Interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.

        (d)  CCC will pay claims only on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an accelerated payment clause in the Firm Export Sales Contract, the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit, the Terms and Conditions Document (if applicable), or any obligation owed by the Foreign Financial Institution to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee that is related to the Letter of Credit issued in favor of the Exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare up to the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued Ordinary Interest, in default, require the Holder of the Payment Guarantee to invoke the acceleration provision in the Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit or, if applicable, in the Terms and Conditions Document, require submission of all claims documents specified in § 1493.170, and make payment to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.

        (e)  If an Assignee submits a claim for default pursuant to Section 1493.170 and all documents submitted appear on their face to conform with the requirements of such section, CCC will not hold the Assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the Assignee for any action, omission, or statement by the Exporter of which the Assignee has no knowledge.

        § 1493.190   Recovery of defaulted payments.

#### § § 1493.190

        (a)  Upon claim payment to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee, CCC will notify the Foreign Financial Institution of CCC's rights under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.

        (b)  (1) In the event that monies related to the obligation in default are recovered by the Exporter or the Assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party, the Importer, or any source whatsoever (excluding payments among CCC, the Exporter, and the Assignee), such monies shall be immediately paid to CCC. Any monies derived from insurance or through the liquidation of any security or collateral after the claim is filed with CCC shall be deemed recoveries that must be paid to CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 Business Days from the date of recovery by the Exporter or the Assignee, such party will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated at a rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the Exporter or the Assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.

        (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a Payment Guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the Holder of the Payment Guarantee its pro rata share, if any, provided that the required information necessary for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If a required payment is not made by CCC within 15 Business Days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated at a rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and interest will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee.

        (c)  Recoveries received by CCC from any source whatsoever that are related to the obligation in default will be allocated by CCC to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default on the date the claim is paid by CCC. Once CCC has paid a particular claim under a Payment Guarantee, CCC pro-rates any collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the Holder of the Payment Guarantee until both CCC and the Holder of the Payment Guarantee have been reimbursed in full.

        (d)  Notwithstanding any other terms of the Payment Guarantee, under the following circumstances the Exporter or the Assignee will be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the Payment Guarantee:

        (1) The Exporter will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined by CCC that the Exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the Exporter for the purpose of obtaining the Payment Guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under the GSM-102 program; and

        (2) The Assignee will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined by CCC that the Assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

        (e)  Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the Holder of the Payment Guarantee, the Holder of the Payment Guarantee and the Exporter will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the Foreign Financial Institution and/or the Importer. Cooperation may include, but is not limited to, submission of documents to the Foreign Financial Institution (or its representative) to establish a claim; participation in discussions with CCC regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to a default; actions related to accelerated payments as specified in § 1493.180(d); and other actions that do not increase the obligation of the Holder of the Payment Guarantee or the Exporter under the Payment Guarantee.

        § 1493.191   Additional obligations and requirements.

#### § § 1493.191

        (a)  For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a Payment Guarantee, the Exporter and the Assignee, if applicable, must maintain and make available all records and respond completely to all inquiries pertaining to sales and deliveries of and extension of credit for U.S. Agricultural Commodities exported in connection with a Payment Guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents, Intervening Purchasers, and related companies involved in special arrangements with the Exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to the premises of the Exporter and the Assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective date of the Payment Guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the Exporter's, Assignee's, agent's, Intervening Purchaser's or related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the Payment Guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. During such period, the Exporter and the Assignee may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the Director, such records would pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the Exporter in connection with the Payment Guarantee.

        (b)  It is the responsibility of all Exporters and U.S. and Foreign Financial Institutions to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and notices to participants relating to the GSM-102 program, as applicable. All Exporters and U.S. and Foreign Financial Institutions participating in the GSM-102 program are hereby on notice that they will be bound by this subpart and any terms contained in the Payment Guarantee and in applicable Program Announcements.

        (c)  All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests (i.e., requests for amendments) by Exporters, Assignees, or Foreign Financial Institutions under this subpart must be signed by a Principal of the Exporter, Assignee, or Foreign Financial Institution or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the Principal, the signature must be accompanied by: Wording indicating the delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, the Exporter, Assignee, or Foreign Financial Institution must ensure that all information and reports required under these regulations are timely submitted.

        (d)  CCC may cancel a Payment Guarantee in the event that an Exporter makes a willful misstatement in the certifications in §§ 1493.80(b) and 1493.140(c) or if the Exporter fails to comply with the provisions of § 1493.150 or paragraph (a) of this section. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC will not cancel its Payment Guarantee, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that an Assignee had no knowledge of the Exporter's misstatement or noncompliance at the time of assignment of the Payment Guarantee.

        § 1493.192   Dispute resolution and appeals.

#### § § 1493.192

        (a)  (1) The Director and the Exporter or the Assignee will attempt to resolve any disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising under the GSM-102 program, this subpart, the applicable Program Announcements and notices to participants, or the Payment Guarantee.

        (2) The Exporter or the Assignee may seek reconsideration of a determination made by the Director by submitting a letter requesting reconsideration to the Director within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of notification to the Exporter or the Assignee of the determination. The Exporter or the Assignee may include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional information that it wishes the Director to consider in reviewing its request. The Director will respond to the request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days of the date on which the request or the final documentary evidence submitted by the Exporter or the Assignee is received by the Director, whichever is later, unless the Director extends the time permitted for response. If the Exporter or the Assignee fails to request reconsideration of a determination by the Director, then the determination of the Director will be deemed final.

        (3) If the Exporter or the Assignee requests reconsideration of a determination by the Director pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Director upholds the original determination, then the Exporter or the Assignee may appeal the Director's final determination to the GSM in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the Exporter or the Assignee fails to appeal the Director's final determination within 30 calendar days as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the Director's decision becomes the final determination of CCC.

        (b)  (1) An Exporter or Assignee that has exhausted the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the GSM for a determination of the Director. An appeal to the GSM must be made in writing and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 calendar days following the date of the final determination by the Director. If the Exporter or Assignee requests an administrative hearing in its appeal letter, it shall be entitled to a hearing before the GSM or the GSM's designee.

        (2) If the Exporter or Assignee does not request an administrative hearing, the Exporter or Assignee must indicate in its appeal letter whether or not it will submit any additional written information or documentation for the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information or documentation must be submitted to the GSM within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal letter to the GSM. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date that final documentary evidence is submitted by the Exporter or Assignee to the GSM.

        (3) If the Exporter or the Assignee has requested an administrative hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing that is mutually convenient for the GSM and the Exporter or Assignee. This date will ordinarily be within 60 calendar days of the date on which the GSM receives the request for a hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The Exporter or Assignee and/or its counsel may present any relevant testimony or documentary evidence to the GSM. A transcript of the hearing will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Exporter or Assignee bears the costs involved in preparing the transcript, although the GSM may decide to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date of the hearing or the date of receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared.

        (4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC. The Exporter or Assignee will be entitled to no further administrative appellate rights.

        (c)  If the Exporter or Assignee has violated the terms of this subpart or the Payment Guarantee by failing to comply with a determination made under this section, and the Exporter or Assignee has exhausted its rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then CCC will have the right to take any measures available to CCC under applicable law.

        (d)  The Exporter will continue to have an obligation to perform pursuant to the provisions of these regulations and the terms of the Payment Guarantee pending the conclusion of all procedures under this section.

        § 1493.195   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1493.195

        (a)  No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the Payment Guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the Payment Guarantee if made with a corporation for its general benefit.

        (b)  The information collection requirements contained in this part (7 CFR part 1493) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Control Number 0551-0004.

      Subpart C—CCC Facility Guarantee Program (FGP) Operations

**Source:** Source: 81 FR 65515, Sept. 22, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1493.200   General statement.

#### § § 1493.200

        (a)  The FGP of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was developed to expand U.S. agricultural commodity exports by making available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing to establish or improve facilities or provide services or goods in emerging markets to improve handling, marketing, processing, storage, or distribution of imported agricultural commodities and products. Such guarantees will primarily promote the export of U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC will give priority to transactions that encourage privatization of the agricultural sector or that benefit private farms and cooperatives in emerging markets, and for which nongovernmental persons agree to assume a relatively larger share of costs. The payment guarantee issued under FGP is an agreement by CCC to pay the seller, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of the payment guarantee, specified amounts of principal and interest in case of default by the foreign financial institution that issued the letter of credit for the sale covered by the payment guarantee. The program is targeted toward those countries that have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this program, CCC seeks to expand and/or maintain market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and producers and assist long-term market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.

        (b)  The FGP is administered under the direction of the General Sales Manager and Vice President, CCC, pursuant to this subpart, subpart A of this part, any program announcements issued by CCC, and, as applicable, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits. From time to time, CCC may issue a notice to participants on the USDA Web site to remind participants of the requirements of the FGP or to clarify the program requirements contained in these regulations in a manner not inconsistent with this subpart and subpart A of this part. Program information, including available program amounts, eligible countries, and approved U.S. and foreign financial institutions, is available on the USDA Web site.

        § 1493.210   Definition of terms.

#### § § 1493.210

        Terms set forth in this part, on the USDA Web site (including in program announcements and notices to participants), and in any CCC-originated documents pertaining to the FGP will have the following meanings:

        Entities are affiliates of each other if, directly or indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third person controls or has the power to control both. Control may include, but is not limited to: Interlocking management or ownership; identity of interests among family members; shared facilities and equipment; or common use of employees.

        A U.S. financial institution that has obtained the legal right to make a claim and receive the payment of proceeds under the payment guarantee.

        A day during which employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Washington, DC metropolitan area are on official duty during normal business hours.

        A foreign purchaser that enters into a firm sales contract with a seller for the sale of goods to be shipped to the destination country and/or U.S. services to be provided in the destination country.

        An entity having a physical office that is either organized under the laws of or registered to do business in the destination country specified in the payment guarantee and that is authorized to act on the buyer's behalf with respect to the sale described in the firm sales contract.

        The Commodity Credit Corporation, an agency and instrumentality of the United States within the Department of Agriculture, authorized pursuant to the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ).

        Interest payable by CCC pursuant to § 1493.370(c).

        A specific deliverable (activity or milestone) measured by objective or quantifiable methods within the firm sales contract which, when met by the seller, results in an obligation to make payment in accordance with the agreed contractual terms without recourse, and triggers the start of coverage under the payment guarantee. Such events may include, but are not limited to, exports of goods, completion of services, or commissioning date of equipment or a facility.

        The price for services as stipulated in the firm sales contract.

If the foreign financial institution is not subject to a banking or other financial regulatory authority, it must submit year-end, audited financial statements in accordance with prevailing accounting standards, in English, for the applicant's most recent fiscal year.

        (iii) CCC will review the preliminary environmental and social screening document submitted by the seller and, if necessary, request additional information from the seller to determine whether the transaction could have potentially significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts. If CCC determines that a transaction may have such significant adverse impacts, the seller must submit an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) with the final application for the payment guarantee.

        (12) The seller's statement, “All certifications set forth in § 1493.270 are hereby being made by the seller in this application” which, when included in the application by the seller, will constitute a certification that it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in § 1493.270 with respect to both the initial and final applications.

        (e)  To provide the public opportunity to review and comment on the potential environmental and social impacts of a transaction, CCC will make available on its Web site a list of pending transactions for which an ESIA is required. Interested parties will have a minimum of 30 business days to request and provide input on an ESIA prior to CCC's final decision. CCC will not disclose any confidential business information associated with a transaction unless such disclosure is authorized by law.

        (f)  The seller may be required to submit reports to CCC on a quarterly, biannual, or annual basis to allow CCC to monitor transactions in which there is a potential for negative environmental and/or social impact. Reporting frequency will be based on the extent of the transaction's impact and any mitigation required. CCC and the seller will agree upon any reporting requirements, including the elements of reporting and the frequency, prior to issuance of a payment guarantee.

        (g)  A final application for a payment guarantee may be approved as submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the seller, or rejected by CCC. CCC shall have the right to request the seller to furnish any other information and documentation it deems pertinent to the evaluation of the seller's application. In the event that the final application is approved, the Director will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the seller. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time specified in § 1493.290(b).

        § 1493.270   Certification requirements for obtaining payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.270

        By providing the statement in § 1493.260(d)(12), the seller is certifying that the information provided in the initial and final applications is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been met. The seller will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to final applications that do not include this statement. If the seller makes false certifications with respect to a payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, in addition to any other rights provided under this subpart or otherwise as a matter of law, to revoke guarantee coverage for any goods not yet exported and services not yet performed and/or to commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the seller. The seller, in submitting an application for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.260(d)(12), certifies that:

        (a) There have not been any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and the transaction complies with applicable United States law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (b) At the time of submission of the final application for payment guarantee, the buyer does not appear as an excluded party on the SAM list;

        (c) The seller is fully in compliance with the requirements of § 1493.320(b) for all existing payment guarantees issued to the seller or has requested and been granted an extension per § 1493.320(b)(3); and

        (d) The information provided pursuant to § 1493.220 has not changed and the seller still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.220.

        § 1493.280   Special requirements of the foreign financial institution letter of credit and the terms and conditions document, if applicable.

#### § § 1493.280

        (a)  (1) A foreign financial institution letter of credit is required in connection with the sale to which CCC's payment guarantee pertains.

        (i) If the obligation to pay by the foreign financial institution is conditioned on shipment documentation, the letter of credit must stipulate presentation of at least one original clean on board bill of lading as a required document, unless:

        (A) The seller, or a related company previously reported to CCC by the seller pursuant to 1493.220(a)(5), is named as the shipper on the clean, on-board bill of lading. If the seller or a related company is named the shipper on the bill of lading, the letter of credit may stipulate a copy or photocopy of an original, clean, on-board bill of lading; or

        (B) The letter of credit stipulates presentation of electronic documents per paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (ii) If the letter of credit will allow for presentation of electronic documents, the letter of credit must so stipulate.

        (iii) If the obligation to pay by the foreign financial institution is conditioned on a contractual event requiring other than shipment documentation, the contractual event must be clearly stipulated in either the letter of credit or the terms and conditions document.

        (2) The use of a terms and conditions document is optional. The terms and conditions document, if any, must be specifically identified and referred to in the foreign financial institution letter of credit.

        (3) The special requirements in paragraph (b) of this section must be documented in one of the two following ways:

        (i) The special requirements may be set forth in the foreign financial institution letter of credit as a special instruction from the foreign financial institution; or

        (ii) The special requirements may be set forth in a separate terms and conditions document.

        (b)  The following provisions are required and must be documented in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) The terms of the repayment obligation, including a specific promise by the foreign financial institution issuing the letter of credit to pay the repayment obligation;

        (2) The following language: “In the event that the Commodity Credit Corporation (“CCC”) is subrogated to the position of the obligee hereunder, this instrument shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of laws principles. In such case, any legal action or proceeding arising under this instrument will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, as determined by CCC, and such parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.”;

        (3) A provision permitting the holder of the payment guarantee to declare all or any part of the repayment obligation, including accrued interest, immediately due and payable, in the event a payment default occurs under the letter of credit or, if applicable, the terms and conditions document; and

        (4) Post default interest terms.

        § 1493.290   Terms and requirements of the payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.290

        (a)  The payment guarantee will provide that CCC agrees to pay the holder of the payment guarantee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value, plus Eligible interest, in the event that the foreign financial institution fails to pay under the foreign financial institution letter of credit and, if applicable, the terms and conditions document. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.

        (b)  The payment guarantee becomes effective on the Date(s) of Performance. For goods, the period of coverage will apply from the date on which interest begins to accrue, if earlier than the date of performance. The payment guarantee will apply to the period beginning with the Date(s) of Performance and will continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto.

        (c)  The terms of CCC's coverage will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any program announcements and notices to participants in effect at the time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.

        (d)  The final allowable date of performance will be specified on the payment guarantee.

        (e)  (1) Except as allowed under § 1493.290(f), CCC will issue a payment guarantee only if the following items collectively represent less than 50 percent of the sum of the net contract value and the value of approved local costs:

        (i) The value of eligible non-U.S. goods; and

        (ii) The value of imported components.

        (2) Imported raw materials and basic manufactured items (such as iron, steel, nuts, bolts, etc.) which are processed, assembled or manufactured in the United States are automatically included in CCC's coverage and are not counted as imported components for the purpose of determining U.S. content.

        (f)  (1) The seller may request a coverage waiver for any of the following:

        (i) To allow for guarantee coverage of non-U.S. goods; and/or

        (ii) The U.S. content test, allowing for guarantee coverage of non-U.S. goods and imported components in U.S. goods in excess of the value permitted under the U.S. content test.

        (2) To request a coverage waiver on one of the bases specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the seller must submit with the initial application for a payment guarantee a justification of why the non-U.S. goods and/or imported components in U.S. goods are essential to the completion of the FGP transaction. This justification must be based on one of the following:

        (i) The goods and/or components are no longer manufactured in or provided by the United States;

        (ii) The use of U.S. goods and/or components is not cost effective; or

        (iii) U.S. goods and/or components are not compatible with the existing infrastructure in the destination country.

        (3) In determining whether to grant a coverage waiver, CCC will consider the following factors:

        (i) Whether information obtained by CCC from industry sources, government agencies, or any other sources supports the justification provided by the seller;

        (ii) Whether the non-U.S. goods (and/or imported components in U.S. goods) are essential to the completion of the transaction; and

        (iii) Any other information CCC determines is relevant.

        (g)  A transaction (or any portion thereof) is ineligible for payment guarantee coverage if at any time CCC determines that:

        (1) The sale includes corrupt payments or extra sales or services or other items extraneous to the transactions provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction;

        (2) The sale does not comply with applicable U.S. law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (3) The buyer is excluded or disqualified from participation in U.S. government programs;

        (4) The goods, services, and/or facility being financed will not primarily benefit U.S. agricultural commodity exports;

        (5) The sale is not an eligible export sale.

        (h)  The following contractual events are ineligible for coverage under an FGP payment guarantee, except where it is determined by the Director to be in the best interest of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such contractual events:

        (1) Contractual events with a date of performance prior to the date of receipt by CCC of the seller's written initial application for a payment guarantee;

        (2) Contractual events with a date of performance later than the final date of performance shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof;

        (3) Contractual events where the date of issuance of a foreign financial institution letter of credit is later than the date of performance; or

        (4) Contractual events that have been guaranteed by CCC under another payment guarantee. If CCC determines that the contractual event has been guaranteed under multiple payment guarantees (or coverage has been requested under multiple payment guarantees), CCC will determine which payment guarantee (or application for payment guarantee), if any, corresponds to an eligible export sale.

        (i)  The payment guarantee may contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or desirable by the Director. Such additional terms, conditions or qualifications as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the seller and the assignee.

        (j)  Any amendments to the firm sales contract that impact contractual event(s) covered by the payment guarantee must be submitted to CCC for approval for coverage prior to the date of performance of the contractual event.

        (k)  A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee may be submitted only by the seller, with the written concurrence of the assignee, if any, and must be accompanied by the revised firm sales contract, if applicable. The Director will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable program announcements and sufficient budget authority exists. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. CCC reserves the right to request additional information from the seller to justify the request and to charge a fee for amendments. Such fees will be announced and available on the USDA Web site. Any request to amend the foreign financial institution on the payment guarantee will require that the holder of the payment guarantee resubmit to CCC the certification in § 1493.310(c)(1)(i) or § 1493.330(d).

        § 1493.300   Fees.

#### § § 1493.300

        (a)  A letter of interest fee, as specified on the USDA Web site, must be received by CCC before CCC will consider the seller's letter of interest.

        (b)  An initial application fee, as specified on the USDA Web site, must be received by CCC before CCC will consider the seller's initial application for a payment guarantee.

        (c)  Guarantee fee rates will be based upon the length of the payment terms provided for in the firm sales contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by CCC, and any other factors that CCC determines appropriate for consideration.

        (d)  The guarantee fee will be computed by multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.

        (e)  The seller shall remit, with his final application, the full amount of the guarantee fee, less the previously paid letter of interest fee, if applicable, and the initial application fee. CCC will not issue a payment guarantee until the full amount of the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The seller's wire transfer or check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and be submitted in the manner specified on the USDA Web site.

        (f)  Letter of interest fees, initial application fees, and guarantee fees will ordinarily not be refundable unless the Director determines that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC.

        § 1493.310   Assignment of the payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.310

        (a)  The seller may assign the payment guarantee only to a U.S. financial institution approved for participation by CCC. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and, unless approved in advance by CCC, may not be:

        (1) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or

        (2) Subject to further assignment.

        (b)  A notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed with CCC by the assignee in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment. The notice of assignment should be received by CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of assignment.

        (c)  (1) The U.S. financial institution must include the following certifications on the notice of assignment: “I certify, that:

        (i) [Name of Assignee] has verified that the foreign financial institution, at the time of submission of the notice of assignment, does not appear as an excluded party on the SAM list; and

        (ii) To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided pursuant to § 1493.230 has not changed and [name of Assignee] still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.230.”

        (2) If the assignee makes a false certification with respect to a payment guarantee, CCC may, in its sole discretion, in addition to any other action available as a matter of law, rescind and cancel the payment guarantee, reject the assignment of the payment guarantee, and/or commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the assignee.

        (d)  In cases where a U.S. financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof to the U.S. financial institution and to the seller issued the payment guarantee.

        (e)  A U.S. financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of a payment guarantee or the proceeds payable under a payment guarantee if such U.S. financial institution:

        (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in compliance with all requirements of § 1493.230(a); or

        (2) Is the branch, agency, or subsidiary of the foreign financial institution issuing the letter of credit; or

        (5) Is owned or controlled by the government of a foreign country and the payment guarantee has been issued in connection with sales of goods or services to buyers located in such foreign country.

        (f)  (1) The holder of the payment guarantee may enter into a repurchase agreement, to which the following requirements apply:

        (i) Any repurchase under a repurchase agreement by the holder of the payment guarantee must be for the entirety of outstanding balance under the associated repayment obligation;

        (ii) In the event of default with respect to the repayment obligation subject to a repurchase agreement, the holder of the payment guarantee must immediately effect such repurchase; and

        (iii) The holder of the payment guarantee must file all documentation required by §§ 1493.350 and 1493.360 in case of a default by the foreign financial institution under the payment guarantee.

        (2) The holder of the payment guarantee shall, within five business days of execution of a transaction under the repurchase agreement, notify CCC of the transaction in writing in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. Such notification must include the following information:

        (i) Name and address of the other party to the repurchase agreement;

        (3) Failure of the holder of the payment guarantee to comply with any of the provisions of § 1493.310(f) may result in CCC annulling coverage on the foreign financial institution letter of credit and Terms and Condition Document, if applicable, covered by the payment guarantee.

        § 1493.320   Evidence of performance.

        (3) Requests for an extension of the time limit for submitting an evidence of performance report must be submitted in writing by the seller to the Director and must include an explanation of why the extension is needed. An extension of the time limit may be granted if such extension is requested prior to the expiration of the time limit for filing and is determined by the Director to be in the best interests of CCC.

        (c)  CCC will not accept any new applications for payment guarantees from a seller under § 1493.260 until the seller is fully in compliance with the requirements of § 1493.320(b) for all existing payment guarantees issued to that seller or has requested and been granted an extension in accordance with § 1493.320(b)(3).

        § 1493.330   Certification requirements for the evidence of performance.

        By providing the statement contained in § 1493.320(a)(12), the seller is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of performance report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been met. The seller will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the seller makes false certifications with respect to a payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, in addition to any other rights provided under this subpart or otherwise as a matter of law, to annul guarantee coverage for any contractual events that have not yet occurred and/or to commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the seller. The seller, in submitting the evidence of performance and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.320(a)(12), certifies that:

        (a) The specifications and/or quantity of the contractual event conform with the information contained in the seller's application for payment guarantee and firm sales contract, or if different, CCC has approved such changes;

        (b) A foreign financial institution letter of credit has been opened in favor of the seller by the foreign financial institution shown on the payment guarantee to cover the dollar amount of the contractual event covered by the payment guarantee, less the initial payment and less discounts and allowances;

        (c) There have not been any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;

        (d) If the seller has not assigned the payment guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, the seller has verified that the foreign financial institution, at the time of submission of the evidence of performance report, does not appear as an excluded party on the SAM list; and

        (e) The information provided pursuant to §§ 1493.220 and 1493.260 has not changed (except as agreed to and amended by CCC) and the seller still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.220.

        § 1493.340   Proof of entry.

#### § § 1493.340

        (a)  The diversion of goods covered by an FGP payment guarantee to a destination country other than that shown on the payment guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Director.

        (b)  (1) Sellers must obtain and maintain records of an official or customary commercial nature that demonstrate the arrival of the goods sold in connection with the FGP in the destination country. At the Director's request, the seller must submit to CCC records demonstrating proof of entry. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the destination country, by an agent or representative of the vessel or shipline that delivered the goods to the destination country, or by a private surveyor in the destination country, or other documentation deemed acceptable by the Director showing:

        (i) That the good(s) entered the destination country;

        (ii) The identification of the export carrier;

        (iii) The quantity of the good(s);

        (iv) A description of the good(s); and

        (v) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the good(s) in the destination country.

        (2) Where shipping documents ( bills of lading) clearly demonstrate that the goods were shipped to the destination country, proof of entry verification may be provided by the buyer.

        § 1493.350   Notice of default.

#### § § 1493.350

        (a)  If the foreign financial institution issuing the letter of credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the letter of credit or the terms and conditions document, the holder of the payment guarantee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not later than 5 business days after the date that payment was due from the foreign financial institution (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in writing to CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site and must include the following information:

        (1) Payment guarantee number;

        (2) Name of the destination country as shown on the payment guarantee;

        (3) Name of the defaulting foreign financial institution;

        (4) Payment due date;

        (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately the amounts for principal and ordinary interest, and including a copy of the repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and ordinary interest rates for each installment;

        (6) Date of foreign financial institution's refusal to pay, if applicable;

        (7) Reason for foreign financial institution's refusal to pay, if known, and copies of any correspondence with the foreign financial institution regarding the default.

        (b)  If the holder of the payment guarantee fails to notify CCC of a default within 5 business days, CCC may deny the claim for that default.

        (c)

        (1) In the event that a foreign financial institution defaults under a repayment obligation under this subpart or under 7 CFR 1493, subpart B, CCC may declare that such foreign financial institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the FGP. If CCC determines that such defaulting foreign financial institution is no longer eligible for the FGP, CCC shall provide written notice of such ineligibility to all sellers and assignees, if any, having payment guarantees covering transactions with respect to which the defaulting foreign financial institution is expected to issue a letter of credit. Receipt of written notice from CCC that a defaulting foreign financial institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the FGP shall constitute withdrawal of coverage of that foreign financial institution under all payment guarantees with respect to any letter of credit issued on or after the date of receipt of such written notice. CCC will not withdraw coverage of the defaulting foreign financial institution under any payment guarantee with respect to any letter of credit issued before the date of receipt of such written notice.

        (2) If CCC withdraws coverage of the defaulting foreign financial institution, CCC will permit the seller (with concurrence of the assignee, if any) to utilize another approved foreign financial institution, and will consider other requested amendments to the payment guarantee, for the balance of the transaction covered by the payment guarantee. If no alternate foreign financial institution is identified to issue the letter of credit within 30 calendar days, CCC will cancel the payment guarantee and refund the seller's guarantee fees corresponding to any unutilized portion of the payment guarantee.

        § 1493.360   Claims for default.

#### § § 1493.360

        (a)  A claim by the holder of the payment guarantee for a defaulted payment will not be paid if it is made later than 180 calendar days from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim must be submitted in writing to CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site. The claim must include the following documents and information:

        (1) An original cover letter signed by the holder of the payment guarantee and containing the following information:

        (i) Payment guarantee number;

        (ii) A description of:

        (A) Any payments from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the defaulted payment that were received by the seller or the assignee prior to submission of the claim; and

        (B) Any security, insurance, or collateral arrangements, whether or not any payment has been realized from such security, insurance, or collateral arrangement as of the time of claim, from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the defaulted payment.

        (iii) The following certifications:

        (A) A certification that the defaulted payment has not been received (or, alternatively, specifying the portion of the scheduled payment that has not been received), listing separately scheduled principal and ordinary interest;

        (B) A certification of the amount of the defaulted payment, indicating separately the amounts for defaulted principal and ordinary interest;

        (C) A certification that all documents submitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section are true and correct copies; and

        (D) A certification that all documents conforming with the requirements for payment under the foreign financial institution letter of credit have been submitted to the negotiating bank or directly to the foreign financial institution under such letter of credit.

        (2) An original instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the holder of the payment guarantee to the amount of payment in default under the applicable sale. The instrument must reference the applicable foreign financial institution letter of credit and, if applicable, the terms and conditions document; and

        (3) A copy of each of the following documents:

        (i) The repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and ordinary interest rates for each installment (if the ordinary interest rates for future payments are unknown at the time of the claim for default is submitted, provide estimates of such rates);

        (ii) (A) The foreign financial institution letter of credit securing the sale; and

        (B) If applicable, the terms and conditions document;

        (iii) For goods, depending upon the method of shipment, the ocean carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, or, if shipped by rail or truck, the bill of lading and the entry certificate or similar document signed by an official of the destination country. If the transaction utilizes electronic bill(s) of lading (e-BL), a print-out of the e-BL from electronic system with an electronic signature is acceptable;

        (iv) The seller's invoice. For shipment of goods, the invoice must show the applicable Incoterms;

        (v) The evidence of performance report(s) previously submitted by the seller to CCC in conformity with the requirements of § 1493.320(a); and

        (vi) If the defaulted payment was part of a transaction executed under a repurchase agreement, written evidence that the repurchase occurred as required under § 1493.310(f)(1)(ii).

        (b)  If a claim is denied by CCC, the holder of the payment guarantee may provide further documentation to CCC to establish that the claim is in good order.

        (c)  If the initial claim is found in good order, the holder of the payment guarantee need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating to failure of the foreign financial institution to make scheduled installments on the same contractual event, the holder of the payment guarantee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.

        (d)  CCC may establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.

        § 1493.370   Payment for default.

#### § § 1493.370

        (a)  Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under § 1493.360, CCC will determine whether or not a default has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee. Such determination shall include, but not be limited to, CCC's determination that all documentation conforms to the specific requirements contained in this subpart, and that all documents submitted for payment conform to the requirements of the letter of credit and, if applicable, the terms and conditions document. If CCC determines that it is liable to the holder of the payment guarantee, CCC will pay the holder of the payment guarantee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  CCC's maximum liability for any claims submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including any CCC late interest Payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:

        (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus Eligible interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the seller or the assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the seller or the assignee); or

        (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment guarantee) of the value of the contractual event indicated in the evidence of performance, plus eligible interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the seller or the assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the seller or the assignee).

        (c)  If CCC does not pay a claim within 15 business days of receiving the claim in good order, CCC late interest will accrue in favor of the holder of the payment guarantee beginning with the sixteenth business day after the day of receipt of a complete and valid claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. CCC late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraph (b) of this section, and will be calculated at a rate equal to the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date CCC late interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.

        (d)  CCC will pay claims only on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due as a result of the claimant invoking an accelerated payment clause in the firm sales contract, the foreign financial institution letter of credit, the terms and conditions document (if applicable), or any obligation owed by the foreign financial institution to the holder of the payment guarantee that is related to the letter of credit issued in favor of the seller, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare up to the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued ordinary interest, in default, require the holder of the payment guarantee to invoke the acceleration provision in the foreign financial institution letter of credit or, if applicable, in the terms and conditions document, require submission of all claims documents specified in § 1493.360, and make payment to the holder of the payment guarantee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.

        (e)  If an assignee submits a claim for default pursuant to § 1493.360 and all documents submitted appear on their face to conform with the requirements of such section, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission, or statement by the seller of which the assignee has no knowledge.

        § 1493.380   Recovery of defaulted payments.

#### § § 1493.380

        (a)  Upon claim payment to the holder of the payment guarantee, CCC will notify the foreign financial institution of CCC's rights under the subrogation agreement to recover all monies in default.

        (b)  (1) In the event that monies related to the obligation in default are recovered by the seller or the assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party, the buyer, or any source whatsoever (excluding payments between CCC, the seller and the assignee), such monies shall be immediately paid to CCC. Any monies derived from insurance or through the liquidation of any security or collateral after the claim is filed with CCC shall be deemed recoveries that must be paid by the seller and/or assignee to CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the seller or the assignee, such party will also owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery of such funds to the date of CCC's receipt of such funds. This interest will be calculated at a rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the seller or the assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.

        (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share if any, provided that the required information necessary for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If a required payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated at a rate equal to the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery, and interest will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.

        (c)  Recoveries received by CCC from any source whatsoever that are related to the obligation in default will be allocated by CCC to the holder of the payment guarantee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default on the date the claim is paid by CCC. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the payment guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the payment guarantee have been reimbursed in full.

        (d)  Notwithstanding any other terms of the payment guarantee, under the following circumstances the seller or the assignee will be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee:

        (1) The seller will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined by CCC that the seller has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the seller for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under the FGP; and

        (2) The assignee will be liable to CCC when and if it is determined by CCC that the assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

        (e)  Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the holder of the payment guarantee, the holder of the payment guarantee and the seller will cooperate with CCC to affect recoveries from the foreign financial institution and/or the buyer. Cooperation may include, but is not limited to, submission of documents to the foreign financial institution (or its representative) to establish a claim; participation in discussions with CCC regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to a default; actions related to accelerated payments as specified in § 1493.370(d); and other actions that do not increase the obligation of the holder of the payment guarantee or the seller under the payment guarantee.

        § 1493.385   Additional obligations and requirements.

#### § § 1493.385

        (a)  For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment guarantee, the seller and the assignee, if applicable, must maintain and make available all records and respond completely to all inquiries pertaining to sales and deliveries of and extension of credit for goods and services sold in connection with a payment guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents and related companies involved in special arrangements with the seller. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to the premises of the seller and the assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the seller's, assignee's, agent's, or related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. During such period, the seller and the assignee may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the Director, such records would pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the seller in connection with the payment guarantee.

        (b)  It is the responsibility of all sellers and U.S. and foreign financial institutions to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations, program announcements, and notices to participants relating to the FGP, as applicable. All sellers and U.S. and foreign financial institutions participating in the FGP are hereby on notice that they will be bound by this subpart and any terms contained in the payment guarantee and in applicable program announcements.

        (c)  All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests ( requests for amendments), by sellers, assignees, or foreign financial institutions under this subpart must be signed by a principal of the seller, assignee, or foreign financial institution or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal, the signature must be accompanied by wording indicating the delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority, and the name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, the seller, assignee, or foreign financial institution must ensure that all information and reports required under these regulations are timely submitted.

        (d)  CCC may cancel a payment guarantee in the event that a seller makes a willful misstatement in the certifications in §§ 1493.270(a) and 1493.330(c) or if the seller fails to comply with the provisions of § 1493.340 or § 1493.385(a). However, notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC will not cancel its payment guarantee if it determines, in its sole discretion, that an assignee had no knowledge of the seller's misstatement or noncompliance at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee.

        § 1493.390   Dispute resolution and appeals.

#### § § 1493.390

        (a)  (1) The Director and the seller or the assignee will attempt to resolve any disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising under the FGP, this subpart, the applicable program announcements and notices to participants, or the payment guarantee.

        (2) The seller or the assignee may seek reconsideration of a determination made by the Director by submitting a letter requesting reconsideration to the Director within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of notification to the seller or the assignee of the determination. The seller or the assignee may include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional information that it wishes the Director to consider in reviewing its request. The Director will respond to the request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days of the date on which the request or the final documentary evidence submitted by the seller or the assignee is received by the Director, whichever is later, unless the Director extends the time permitted for response. If the seller or the assignee fails to request reconsideration of a determination by the Director within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination, then the determination of the Director will be deemed final.

        (3) If the seller or the assignee requests reconsideration of a determination by the Director pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Director upholds the original determination, then the seller or the assignee may appeal the Director's final determination to the GSM in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the seller or the assignee fails to appeal the Director's final determination within 30 calendar days, as provided in § 1493.390(b)(1), then the Director's decision becomes the final determination of CCC.

        (b)  (1) A seller or assignee that has exhausted the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal a final determination of the Director to the GSM. An appeal to the GSM must be made in writing and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 calendar days following the date of the final determination by the Director. If the seller or the assignee requests an administrative hearing in its appeal letter, it shall be entitled to a hearing before the GSM or the GSM's designee.

        (2) If the seller or the assignee does not request an administrative hearing, the seller or the assignee must indicate in its appeal letter whether or not it will submit any additional written information or documentation for the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information or documentation must be submitted to the GSM within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal letter to the GSM. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date that final documentary evidence is submitted by the seller or the assignee to the GSM.

        (3) If the seller or the assignee has requested an administrative hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing that is mutually convenient for the GSM and the seller or the assignee. This date will ordinarily be within 60 calendar days of the date on which the GSM receives the request for a hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The seller or the assignee and/or its counsel may present any relevant testimony or documentary evidence to the GSM. A transcript of the hearing will not ordinarily be prepared unless the seller or the assignee bears the costs involved in preparing the transcript, although the GSM may decide to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date of the hearing or the date of receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared.

        (4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC. The seller or the assignee will be entitled to no further administrative appellate rights.

        (c)  If the seller or the assignee has violated the terms of this subpart or the payment guarantee by failing to comply with a determination made under this section, and the seller or the assignee has exhausted its rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then CCC will have the right to exercise any remedies available to CCC under applicable law.

        (d)  The seller will continue to have an obligation to perform pursuant to the provisions of these regulations and the terms of the payment guarantee pending the conclusion of all procedures under this section.

        § 1493.395   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1493.395

        (a)  No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if made with a corporation for its general benefit.

        (b)  The information collection requirements contained in this part (7 CFR part 1493) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Control Number 0551-0032.

      Subpart D—CCC Supplier Credit Guarantee Program Operations

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 33831, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

        § 1493.400   General statement.

#### § § 1493.400

        (a)  (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP). The restrictions and criteria set forth at subpart A for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) will apply to this subpart. The SCGP was developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. exporters to extend financing on credit terms of not more than 180 days to importers of U.S. agricultural commodities.

        (2) The SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S. exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee. The program is operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The program is targeted toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.

        (3) The credit facility created by this program is the SCGP payment guarantee (payment guarantee). The payment guarantee is an agreement by CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds, specified amounts of principal and, where applicable, interest due from, but not paid by, the importer incurring the obligation in connection with the export sale to which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, rather than government, financing and incurs a substantial portion of the risk of default by the importer. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be able to operate the program for the purposes specified in § 1493.2.

        (b)  (1) For the purpose of the SCGP, CCC will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for the agricultural commodities will be made under an unconditional and irrevocable importer obligation to a U.S. exporter payable in U.S. dollars, as defined in § 1493.410(n).

        (2) The exporter may assign the right to proceeds under the importer obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the importer obligation.

        (3) The SCGP payment guarantee is designed to protect the exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the importer under the importer's obligation.

        (c)  The SCGP will be administered pursuant to subpart A and this subpart and any Program Announcements and Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, this subpart. This program is under the general administrative responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS/USDA). The review and payment of claims for loss will be administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular USDA or CCC offices, will be announced by a public press release (see § 1493.410(c), “Contacts P/R”).

        (d)  From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a SCGP allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof, will indicate the form of promissory note required by CCC, and will provide other pertinent information. Exporters may negotiate export sales to importers in that country for one of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's sales contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a contractual shipping deadline will be stated in the Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified “undesignated” or “unallocated” dollar amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country become fully used, an additional allocation from the “unallocated” or “undesignated” portion of the total country allocation may then be designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include an “unallocated” or “undesignated” dollar amount will contain further information on the “unallocated” or “undesignated” portion of the country allocation.

        § 1493.410   Definition of terms.

#### § § 1493.410

        (b)  Any exporter that is qualified under subpart B, § 1493.30 is qualified under this section to submit applications for a SCGP payment guarantee, and the information provided by the exporter pursuant to § 1493.30 will be deemed to also have been provided under this section. Each application must include the statement required by § 1493.430(a)(17) incorporating the certifications of § 1493.440, including the certification in § 1493.440(e) that the information previously provided pursuant to § 1493.420 has not changed.

        (c)  CCC will promptly notify applicants that have submitted information required by this section whether they have qualified to participate in the program. Any applicant failing to qualify will be given an opportunity to provide additional information for consideration by CCC.

        (d)  An applicant may be ineligible to participate in the SCGP if:

        (1) Such applicant is currently debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment from contracting with or participating in any program administered by a U.S. Government agency; or

        § 1493.430   Application for a payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.430

        (a) A firm export sale must exist before an exporter may submit an application for a payment guarantee. An application for a payment guarantee may be submitted in writing or may be made by telephone, but, if made by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing to the office specified in the Contacts P/R. An application must identify the name and address of the exporter and include the following information:

        (1) Name of the destination country;

        (2) Name and address of the importer;

        (3) Name and address of the intervening purchaser, if any, and a statement that the commodity will be shipped directly to the importer in the destination country;

        (4) Date of sale;

        (5) Exporter's sale number;

        (6) Delivery period as agreed between the exporter and the importer;

        (7) A full description of the commodity (including packaging, if any);

        (8) Mean quantity, contract loading tolerance and, if the exporter chooses, a request for CCC to reserve coverage up to the maximum quantity permitted by the contract loading tolerance;

        (9) Unit sales price of the commodity, or a mechanism to establish the price, as agreed between the exporter and the importer. If the commodity was sold on the basis of CFR or CIF, the actual (if known at the time of application) or estimated value of freight and, in the case of sales made on a CIF basis, the actual (if known at the time of application) or estimated value of marine and war risk insurance, must be specified;

        (10) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any;

        (11) Port value (includes upward loading tolerance, if any);

        (12) Guaranteed value;

        (13) Guarantee fee;

        (14) The term length for the credit being extended and the intervals between principal payments for each shipment to be made under the export sale;

        (15) A statement indicating whether any portion of the export sale for which the exporter is applying for a payment guarantee is also being used as the basis for an application for participation in any of the following CCC or USDA export programs: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program. The number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under one of these programs should be included, as applicable;

        (16) Other information as requested by CCC or specified in Program Announcements and Notices to Participants, as applicable; and

        (17) The exporter's statement, “ALL SECTION 1493.440 CERTIFICATIONS ARE BEING MADE IN THIS APPLICATION” which, when included in the application by the exporter, will constitute a certification that it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in § 1493.440.

        (b) An application for a payment guarantee may be approved as submitted, approved with modifications agreed to by the exporter, or rejected by the GSM. In the event that the application is approved, the GSM will cause a payment guarantee to be issued in favor of the exporter. Such payment guarantee will become effective at the time specified in § 1493.450(b). If, based upon a price review, the unit sales price of the commodity does not fall within the prevailing commercial market level ranges, as determined by CCC, the application will not be approved.

        (c) Ineligible exporter. An exporter will be ineligible to obtain a payment guarantee if such exporter:

        (1) Directly or indirectly owns or controls the importer;

        (2) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the importer; or

        (3) Is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a person(s) or entity(ies) which also owns or controls the importer.

        § 1493.440   Certification requirements for payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.440

        By providing the statement in § 1493.430(a)(17), the exporter is certifying that the information provided in the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.430(a)(17), certifies that:

        (a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by § 1493.410(x).

        (b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law;

        (c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;

        (d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose of securing business; and

        (e) The information provided pursuant to § 1493.420 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter.

        § 1493.450   Payment guarantee.

#### § § 1493.450

        (a)  The payment guarantee will provide that CCC agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that the importer fails to pay under the importer obligation. unless CCC determines with respect to the particular transaction and claim that the guaranteed portion of the port value exceeded the prevailing U.S. market value for the same, or same type of agricultural commodity or product. In making this determination, CCC will adjust the prevailing U.S. market value for estimated freight and/or insurance costs if the export sale was made on a CFR or CIF basis. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.

        (b)  The payment guarantee will apply to a credit period not exceeding 180 days beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or from the date when interest begins to accrue whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee or amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural commodities or products thereof specified in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee.

        (c)  The terms of CCC's coverage will be set forth in the payment guarantee, as approved by CCC, and will include the provisions of this subpart, which may be supplemented by any Program Announcements and/or Notices to Participants in effect at the time the payment guarantee is approved by CCC.

        (d)  The final date to export shown on the payment guarantee will be one month, as determined by CCC, after the contractual deadline for shipping.

        (e)  The exporter may apply for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee fee, based at least on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (, lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.

        (f)  Commodities with a date of export prior to the date of receipt by CCC of the exporter's telephonic or written application for a payment guarantee, or with a date of export made after the final date for export shown on the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof, are ineligible for guarantee coverage under this subpart, except where it is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.

        (g)  CCC may approve payment guarantees under this subpart only in connection with sales of United States agricultural commodities as defined in § 1493.410(x). CCC may not provide guarantee coverage under this subpart on credit extended for the value of any foreign agricultural component.

        (h)  The payment guarantee may contain such additional terms, conditions, and limitations as deemed necessary or desirable by the GSM. Such additional terms, conditions or qualifications, as stated in the payment guarantee are binding on the exporter or the exporter's assignee.

        (i)  A request for an amendment of a payment guarantee may be submitted only by the exporter (with the concurrence of the assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's assignee are not viewed as amendments.)

        § 1493.460   Guarantee rates and fees.

#### § § 1493.460

        (a)  The current payment guarantee fee rate(s) will be available by Program Announcement.

        (b)  The guarantee fee will be computed by multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate.

        (c)  The exporter shall remit, with his written application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts P/R.

        (d)  Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.

        § 1493.470   Evidence of export.

#### § § 1493.470

        (a)  The exporter is required to provide CCC an evidence of export report for each shipment made under the payment guarantee. This report must include the following:

        (1) Payment guarantee number;

        (2) Date of export;

        (3) Exporter's sale number;

        (4) Exported value;

        (5) Quantity;

        (6) A full description of the commodity exported;

        (7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price at export differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee, the exporter is also required to submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference;

        (8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any;

        (9) Number of the Agreement assigned by USDA under any other program if any portion of the export sale was also approved for participation in any of the following CCC or USDA export program: Export Enhancement Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program, or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program; and

        (10) The exporter's statement, “ALL SECTION 1493.480 CERTIFICATIONS ARE BEING MADE IN THIS EVIDENCE OF EXPORT” which, when included in the evidence of export by the exporter, will constitute a certification that it is in compliance with all the requirements set forth in § 1493.480.

        (b)  The exporter must provide a written report to the office specified in the Contacts P/R within 60 calendar days if the export was by rail or truck; or 30 calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period for filing a report of export will commence upon each date of export of the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence of export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, the payment guarantee will become null and void only if and only to the extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in:

        (1) Significant financial harm to CCC;

        (2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program;

        (3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or

        (4) A threat to the integrity of the program. The time limit for submission of an evidence of export report may be extended if such extension is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC.

        (c)  Exporters may have a mandatory reporting responsibility under section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended (7 U.S.C. 5712) for exports of wheat and wheat flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, and other agricultural commodities and products thereof.

        § 1493.480   Certification requirements for the evidence of export.

#### § § 1493.480

        By providing the statement contained in § 1493.470(a)(10), the exporter is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.470(a)(10), certifies that:

        (a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by § 1493.410(x).

        (b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;

        (c) There is an importer obligation as defined in § 1493.410(n) to cover the exported value of the commodity exported;

        (d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and

        (e) The information provided pursuant to § 1493.420 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.420 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements.

        § 1493.490   Proof of entry.

#### § § 1493.490

        (a)  The diversion of commodities covered by a SCGP payment guarantee to a country other than that shown on the payment guarantee is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by the GSM.

        (b)  Exporters must obtain and maintain records of an official or customary commercial nature and grant authorized USDA officials access to such documents or records as may be necessary to demonstrate the arrival of the agricultural commodities exported in connection with the SCGP in the country that was the intended country of destination of such commodities. Records demonstrating proof of entry must be in English or be accompanied by a certified or other translation acceptable to CCC. Records acceptable to meet this requirement include an original certification of entry signed by a duly authorized customs or port official of the importing country, by the importer, by an agent or representative of the vessel or shipline which delivered the agricultural commodity to the importing country, or by a private surveyor in the importing country, or other documentation deemed acceptable by the GSM showing:

        (1) That the agricultural commodity entered the importing country;

        (2) The identification of the export carrier;

        (3) The quantity of the agricultural commodity;

        (5) The date(s) and place(s) of unloading of the agricultural commodity in the importing country. (Records of proof of entry need not be submitted with a claim for loss, except as may be provided in § 1493.500(b)(4)(ii).)

        § 1493.500   Notice of default and claims for loss.

#### § § 1493.500

        (a)  If the importer fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the importer obligation, the exporter or the exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date that payment was due from the importer (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:

        (1) Payment guarantee number;

        (2) Name of the country;

        (3) Name of the defaulting importer;

        (4) Due date;

        (5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately the amounts for principal and interest;

        (6) Date of importer's refusal to pay, if applicable; and

        (7) Reason for importer's refusal to pay, if known.

        (b)  A claim for a loss by the exporter or the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following information and documents:

        (1) Payment guarantee number;

        (2) A certification that the scheduled payment has not been received;

        (3) A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the importer obligation applicable to the claim;

        (4) A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:

        (i) The importer obligation;

        (ii) Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar document signed by an official of the importing country;

        (iii)(A) The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or

        (B) If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's invoice to the importer;

        (iv) An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of payment in default under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the applicable importer obligation; and

        (v) A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the exporter to CCC pursuant to § 1493.470(a).

        (c)  If the initial claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating to failure of the importer to make scheduled installments on the same export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated in paragraph (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including the date the original claim was filed with CCC.

        § 1493.510   Payment for loss.

#### § § 1493.510

        (a)  Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under § 1493.500, CCC will determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter and/or the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  Subject to a determination by CCC with respect to prevailing U.S. market value pursuant to § 1493.450(a) of this part, CCC's maximum liability for any claims for loss submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including any late interest payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:

        (1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus eligible interest; or

        (2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment guarantee) of the exported value indicated in the evidence of export, plus eligible interest.

        (c)  If a claim is not paid within one day of receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order, late interest will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee beginning with the first day after the day of receipt of a claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date.

        (d)  CCC will pay claims only for losses on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract or the importer obligation unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.

        (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a payment guarantee, CCC will not, except pursuant to a determination under § 1493.450(a) of this part, hold the assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has no knowledge, provided that:

        (1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under §§ 1493.470 and 1493.480, excluding post-export adjustments (, corrections to evidence of export reports); and

        (2) The exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements and documents specified in § 1493.500.

        § 1493.520   Recovery of losses.

#### § § 1493.520

        (a)  Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the importer of CCC's rights under the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.

        (b)  (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from the importer or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer, CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such date to the date of payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's share of the recovery.

        (2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will pay the holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided that the required information necessary for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution, whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such interest will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable to the holder of the payment guarantee.

        (c)  Recoveries made by CCC from the importer, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment guarantee, CCC pro rates any collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A to § 1493.520—Illustration of Pro Rata Allocation of Recoveries—provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).

        (d)  Notwithstanding any other terms of the payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under SCGP. Further, the exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

        (e)  The violation by an exporter of the certifications in §§ 1493.440(b) and 1493.480(d) or the failure of an exporter to comply with the provisions of §§ 1493.490 or 1493.530(e) will not affect the validity of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the time such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee.

        (f)  Upon payment by CCC of a claim to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will cooperate with CCC to effect recoveries from the importer.

        § 1493.530   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 1493.530

        (a)  (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by CCC, be:

        (i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties; or

        (ii) Subject to further assignment.

        (2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.

        (3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing by an officer of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment.

        (4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment.

        (b)  A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a payment guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:

        (1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;

        (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or

        (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation.

        (c)  A financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable under a payment guarantee approved by CCC if such financial institution:

        (1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC;

        (2) Owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation; or

        (3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the entity issuing the importer obligation.

        (d)  CCC may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under the payment guarantee has been assigned, with the agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.

        (e)  (1) For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment guarantee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and deliveries of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities exported in connection with a payment guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies of the exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's, or related company's books, records and accounts concerning transactions relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee may be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with the payment guarantee.

        (2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by § 1493.490(b), and must provide access to such documentation if requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-year period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (f)  It is the responsibility of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations, Program Announcements, and Notices to Participants issued pursuant to this subpart. Applicants for payment guarantees are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms contained in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.

        (g)  All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests (, requests for amendments), by exporters or exporters' assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of the exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf of the principal or the officer, the signature must be accompanied by: Wording indicating the delegation of authority or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/reports required under these regulations are submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge receipt of a submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope for return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee must also submit a self-addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.

        (h)  No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the payment guarantee or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the payment guarantee if made with a corporation for its general benefit.

        (i)  The information requirements contained in this part (7 CFR part 1493, subpart D) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Control Number 0551-0037.

#### § § 1499.1

      (a) This part sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the award of donated commodities and funds by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to recipients under the Food for Progress (FFPr) Program. Under the FFPr Program, recipients use the donated commodities, proceeds from any sale of such commodities, CCC-provided funds, and program income to implement a project in a foreign country pursuant to an agreement with CCC. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the FFPr Program on behalf of CCC.

      (b)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, USDA adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.

      (2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to the FFPr Program, except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section.

      (c) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the FFPr Program, to the extent that such regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 ) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC apply to the FFPr Program.

      (d) In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1736o(b)(5), assistance under the FFPr Program may be provided to governments of emerging agricultural countries, intergovernmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, nonprofit agricultural organizations or cooperatives, nongovernmental organizations, colleges or universities, and any other private entities.

      (e) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, and the provisions of 2 CFR part 400 and of this part, do not apply to an award by CCC under the FFPr Program to a recipient that is a foreign public entity, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, and, therefore, they do not apply to a foreign government or an intergovernmental organization.

      (f)(1) The OMB guidance at subparts A through E of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to all awards by CCC under the FFPr Program to all recipients that are private voluntary organizations, including a private voluntary organization that is a foreign organization, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1; nonprofit agricultural organizations or cooperatives, including a nonprofit agricultural organization or cooperative that is a foreign organization; nongovernmental organizations, including a nongovernmental organization that is a for-profit entity or a foreign organization; colleges or universities; or other private entities, including a private entity that is a for-profit entity or a foreign organization.

      (2) The OMB guidance at subparts A through E of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to all subawards to all subrecipients under this part, except in cases:

      (i) Where the subrecipient is a foreign public entity; or

      (ii) Where CCC determines that the application of these provisions to a subaward to a subrecipient that is a foreign organization would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government or would not be in the best interest of the United States.

      (g)(1) The OMB guidance at subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies only to awards by CCC to recipients that are private voluntary organizations, agricultural organizations or cooperatives, nongovernmental organizations, colleges or universities, or other private entities, but that are not for-profit entities or foreign organizations.

      (2) The OMB guidance at subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to subawards to subrecipients under this part, except where the subrecipient is a for-profit entity, foreign public entity, or foreign organization.

      (3) Audit requirements for recipients and subrecipients that are for-profit entities or foreign organizations are set forth in § 1499.18.

      § 1499.6   Payments.

#### § § 1499.6

      (a) If a recipient arranges for transportation in accordance with § 1499.7(b)(2), CCC will, as specified in the agreement, pay the costs of such transportation to the ocean carrier or to the recipient. The recipient must, as specified in the agreement, submit to CCC, arrange to be submitted to CCC, or maintain on file and make available to CCC, the following documents:

      (1) The original, or a true copy, of each on board bill of lading indicating the freight rate and signed by the originating ocean carrier;

      (2) For all non-containerized cargoes:

      (i) A signed copy of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) Official Stowage Examination Certificate;

      (ii) A signed copy of the National Cargo Bureau Certificate of Readiness; and

      (iii) A signed copy of the Certificate of Loading issued by the National Cargo Bureau or a similar qualified independent surveyor;

      (3) For all containerized cargoes, a copy of the FGIS Container Condition Inspection Certificate;

      (4) A signed copy of the U.S. Food Aid Booking Note or charter party covering ocean transportation of the cargo;

      (5) In the case of charter shipments, a signed notice of arrival at the first discharge port, unless CCC has determined that circumstances that could not have been reasonably anticipated or controlled (force majeure) have prevented the ocean carrier's arrival at the first port of discharge; and

      (6) A request for payment of freight, survey costs other than at load port, and other expenses approved by CCC.

      (b) If the agreement specifies that some or all of the documents listed in paragraph (a) of this section will be submitted to CCC, then CCC will not render payment for transportation services until it has received all of the specified documents.

      (c) If a recipient arranges for transportation in accordance with § 1499.7(b)(2), and the recipient uses a freight forwarder, the recipient must ensure that the freight forwarder is registered in the SAM and require the freight forwarder to submit the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The recipient will ensure that the total commission or fees paid to intermediaries in the transportation procurement process will not exceed two and a half percent of the total transportation costs.

      (d) In no case will CCC provide payment to a recipient for demurrage costs or pay demurrage to any other entity.

      (e) If CCC has agreed to be responsible for the costs of transporting, storing, and distributing the donated commodities from the designated discharge port or the point of entry into the target country, and if the recipient will bear or has borne any of these costs, in accordance with the agreement, CCC will either provide an advance payment or a reimbursement to the recipient in the amount of such costs, in the manner set forth in the agreement.

      (f) If the agreement authorizes the payment of CCC-provided funds, CCC will generally provide the funds to the recipient on an advance payment basis, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305(b). In addition, the following procedures will apply to advance payments:

      (1) A recipient may request advance payments of CCC-provided funds, up to the total amount specified in the agreement. When making an advance payment request, a recipient must provide, for each agreement for which it is requesting an advance, total expenditures to date; an estimate of expenses to be covered by the advance; total advances previously requested, if any; the amount of cash on hand from the preceding advance; and, if necessary, a request to roll over any unused funds from the preceding advance to the current request period. The advance payment request must take into account any program income earned since the preceding advance.

      (2) Whenever possible, a recipient should consolidate advance payment requests to cover anticipated cash needs for all food assistance program awards made by CCC to the recipient. A recipient may request advance payments with no minimum time required between requests.

      (3) A recipient must minimize the amount of time that elapses between the transfer of funds by CCC and the disbursement of funds by the recipient. A recipient must fully disburse funds from the preceding advance before it submits a new advance request for the same agreement, with the exception that the recipient may request to retain the balance of any funds that have not been disbursed and roll it over into a new advance request if the new advance request is made within 90 days after the preceding advance was made.

      (4) CCC will review all requests to roll over funds from the preceding advance that have not been disbursed and make a decision based on the merits of the request. CCC will consider factors such as the amount of funding that a recipient is requesting to roll over, the length of time that the recipient has been in possession of the funds, any unforeseen or extenuating circumstances, the recipient's history of performance, and findings from recent financial audits or compliance reviews.

      (5) CCC will not approve any request for an advance or rollover of funds if the most recent financial report, as specified in the agreement, is past due, or if any required report, as specified in any open agreement between the recipient and CCC or FAS, is more than three months in arrears.

      (6)(i) A recipient must return to CCC any funds advanced by CCC that have not been disbursed as of the 91st day after the advance was made; provided, however, that paragraphs (f)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section will apply if the recipient submits a request to CCC before that date to roll over the funds into a new advance.

      (ii) If a recipient submits a request to roll over funds into a new advance, and CCC approves the rollover of funds, such funds will be considered to have been advanced on the date that the recipient receives the approval notice from CCC, for the purposes of complying with the requirement in paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section.

      (iii) If a recipient submits a request to roll over funds into a new advance, and CCC does not approve the rollover of some or all of the funds, such funds must be returned to CCC.

      (iv) If a recipient must return funds to CCC in accordance with paragraph (f)(6) of this section, the recipient must return the funds by the later of five business days after the 91st day after the funds were advanced, or five business days after the date on which the recipient receives notice from CCC that it has denied the recipient's request to roll over the funds; provided, however, that CCC may specify a different date for the return of funds in a written communication to the recipient.

      (7) Except as may otherwise be provided in the agreement, a recipient must deposit and maintain in an insured bank account located in the United States all funds advanced by CCC. The account must be interest-bearing, unless one of the exceptions in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(8) applies or CCC determines that this requirement would constitute an undue burden. A recipient will not be required to maintain a separate bank account for advance payments of CCC-provided funds. However, a recipient must be able to separately account for funds received, obligated, and expended under each agreement. When the recipient requires the use of funds that have been advanced by CCC to pay approved expenses under this agreement, the recipient may transfer the funds from the bank account located in the United States to a bank account in the target country.

      (8) A recipient may retain, for administrative purposes, up to $500 per Federal fiscal year of any interest earned on funds advanced under an agreement. The recipient must remit to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services any additional interest earned during the Federal fiscal year on such funds, in accordance with the procedures in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9).

      (g) If a recipient is required to pay funds to CCC in connection with an agreement, the recipient must make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

Such transportation will be arranged for by:

      (1) CCC in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in 48 CFR chapter 1, the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation (AGAR) in 48 CFR chapter 4, and directives issued by the Director, Office of Contracting and Procurement, USDA; or

      (2) The recipient, with payment by CCC, in the manner specified in the agreement.

      (c) A recipient that is responsible for transportation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must declare in the transportation contract the point at which the ocean carrier will take custody of donated commodities to be transported.

      (d) A recipient may only use the services of a transportation company that is legally operating in the country in which it will be transporting the donated commodities and that would not have a conflict of interest in transporting such donated commodities.

      (e) A recipient that arranges for transportation in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section may only use the services of a freight forwarder that is licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission and that would not have a conflict of interest in carrying out the freight forwarder duties. To assist CCC in determining whether there is a potential conflict of interest, the recipient must submit to CCC a certification indicating that the freight forwarder:

      (1) Is not engaged in, and will not engage in, supplying commodities or furnishing ocean transportation or ocean transportation-related services for commodities provided under any FFPr Program agreement to which the recipient is a party; and

      (2) Is not affiliated with the recipient and has not made arrangements to give or receive any payment, kickback, or illegal benefit in connection with its selection as an agent of the recipient.

      (f) A recipient will be responsible for arranging and paying for any transportation of the donated commodities after their arrival at the designated discharge port or point of entry for as long as the recipient has title to such donated commodities, except as may otherwise be provided in the agreement.

The recipient must make arrangements with the target country government for all donated commodities that will be distributed to beneficiaries to be imported and distributed free from all customs duties, tolls, and taxes. A recipient is encouraged to make similar arrangements, where possible, with the government of a country where donated commodities to be sold or bartered are delivered.

      (b) A recipient must, as provided in the agreement, arrange for transporting, storing, and distributing the donated commodities from the designated point and time where title to the donated commodities passes to the recipient, except that CCC will arrange for transporting the donated commodities in accordance with § 1499.7(b)(1) when CCC determines that it is applicable.

      (c) A recipient must maintain the donated commodities in good condition from the time that it takes possession of such donated commodities at the designated discharge port, the point of entry, or the point of receipt from the originating carrier until their distribution, sale or barter.

      (d) A recipient must comply with the following requirements in this paragraph, and the requirements specified in the agreement, regarding the acknowledgment of funding by USDA, the use of the USDA logo, and communications to the public:

      (1) If a recipient arranges for the packaging or repackaging of donated commodities that are to be distributed, the recipient must ensure that the packaging:

      (i) Is plainly labeled in the language of the target country;

      (ii) Contains the name of the donated commodities;

      (iii) Includes a statement indicating that the donated commodities are furnished by the Food for Progress Program of the United States Department of Agriculture; and

      (iv) Includes a statement indicating that the donated commodities must not be sold, exchanged or bartered.

      (2) If a recipient arranges for the processing and repackaging of donated commodities that are to be distributed, the recipient must ensure that the packaging:

      (i) Is plainly labeled in the language of the target country;

      (3) If a recipient distributes donated commodities that are not packaged, the recipient must display a sign at the distribution site that includes the name of the donated commodities, a statement indicating that the donated commodities are being furnished by the Food for Progress Program of the United States Department of Agriculture, and a statement indicating that the donated commodities must not be sold, exchanged, or bartered.

      (4) A recipient must ensure that signs are displayed at all activity implementation and commodity distribution sites to inform beneficiaries that funding for the project was provided by the Food for Progress Program of the United States Department of Agriculture.

      (5) A recipient must ensure that all communications to the public relating to the project, the activities, or the donated commodities, whether made through print, broadcast, digital, or other media, include a statement acknowledging that funding was provided by the Food for Progress Program of the United States Department of Agriculture.

A recipient must also ensure that the USDA logo is used in communications to the public in accordance with the agreement.

      (e)(1) At the request of a recipient, CCC may waive compliance with one or more of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section. A recipient may submit a written request for a waiver at any time after the agreement has been signed. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the recipient must comply with the requirement(s) while awaiting a determination by CCC regarding its waiver request.

      (2) If a recipient determines that compliance with one or more of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section poses an imminent threat of injury, loss of life, or destruction of property in the target country, the recipient must submit a request to CCC for a waiver of such requirement(s), with an explanation of the safety or security risk, as soon as possible. The recipient will not have to comply with such requirement(s) while awaiting a determination by CCC regarding its waiver request.

      (f) In exceptional circumstances, CCC may, on its own initiative, waive one or more of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section for programmatic reasons.

      § 1499.9   Damage to or loss of donated commodities.

#### § § 1499.9

      (a) CCC will be responsible for the donated commodities prior to the transfer of title to the donated commodities to the recipient. The recipient will be responsible for the donated commodities while the recipient has title to the donated commodities. The title will transfer as specified in the agreement.

      (b)(1) A recipient must inform CCC, in the manner set forth in the agreement, of any damage to or loss of donated commodities that occurs while the recipient has title to the donated commodities. The recipient must comply with the following procedures when reporting such damage to or loss of donated commodities:

      (i) If the amount of the damage or loss is estimated to exceed $20,000, the recipient must notify CCC in writing immediately after becoming aware of such damage or loss and, in this notification, provide detailed information about the circumstances surrounding such damage or loss, the quantity of damaged or lost donated commodities, and the amount of the damage or loss;

      (ii) If the amount of the damage or loss is estimated to exceed $1,000 but not to exceed $20,000, the recipient must notify CCC in writing of the damage or loss within 15 days after the date that the recipient becomes aware of it and then provide detailed information about the damage or loss in the first report required to be filed under § 1499.13(c) that is due after the date that the recipient becomes aware of such damage or loss; and

      (iii) If the amount of the damage or loss is estimated not to exceed $1,000, the recipient must notify CCC, and provide detailed information about the damage or loss, in the first report required to be filed under § 1499.13(c) that is due after the date that the recipient becomes aware of such damage or loss.

      (2) The recipient must take all steps necessary to protect its interests and the interests of CCC with respect to any damage to or loss of the donated commodities that occurs while the recipient has title to the donated commodities.

      (c) A recipient will be responsible for arranging for an independent cargo surveyor to inspect the donated commodities upon discharge from the ocean carrier and prepare a survey or outturn report. The report must show the quantity and condition of the donated commodities discharged from the ocean carrier and must indicate the most likely cause of any damage noted in the report. The report must also indicate the time and place when the survey took place. All discharge surveys must be conducted contemporaneously with the discharge of the ocean carrier, unless CCC determines that failure to do so was justified under the circumstances. For donated commodities shipped on a through bill of lading, the recipient must also obtain a delivery survey. All surveys obtained by the recipient must, to the extent practicable, be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the recipient, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report must be signed by all three parties. The recipient must obtain a copy of each discharge or delivery survey report within 45 days after the completion of the survey. The recipient must make each such report available to CCC upon request, or in the manner specified in the agreement. CCC will reimburse the recipient for the reasonable costs of these services, as determined by CCC.

      (d) If donated commodities are damaged or lost during the time that they are in the care of the ocean carrier:

      (1) The recipient must ensure that any reports, narrative chronology, or other commentary prepared by the independent cargo surveyor, and any such documentation prepared by a port authority, stevedoring service, or customs official, or an official of the transit or target country government or the transportation company, are provided to CCC;

      (2) The recipient must provide to CCC the names and addresses of any individuals known to be present at the time of discharge or unloading, or during the survey, who can verify the quantity of damaged or lost donated commodities;

      (3) If the damage or loss occurred with respect to a bulk shipment on an ocean carrier, the recipient must ensure that the independent cargo surveyor:

      (i) Observes the discharge of the cargo;

      (ii) Reports on discharging methods, including scale type, calibrations and any other factors that may affect the accuracy of scale weights, and, if scales are not used, states the reason therefor and describes the actual method used to determine weight;

      (iii) Estimates the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge through ocean carrier negligence;

      (iv) Advises on the quality of sweepings;

      (v) Obtains copies of port or ocean carrier records, if possible, showing the quantity discharged; and

      (vi) Notifies the recipient immediately if the surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged or if additional services are necessary to protect the cargo; and

      (4) If the damage or loss occurred with respect to a container shipment on an ocean carrier, the recipient must ensure that the independent cargo surveyor lists the container numbers and seal numbers shown on the containers, indicates whether the seals were intact at the time the containers were opened, and notes whether the containers were in any way damaged.

      (e) If donated commodities to which a recipient has title sustain damage in excess of $5,000 at any time prior to their distribution or sale under the agreement, regardless of the party at fault, the recipient must immediately arrange for an inspection by a public health official or other competent authority approved by CCC and provide to CCC a certification by such public health official or other competent authority regarding the exact quantity and condition of the damaged donated commodities. The value of the donated commodities prior to the damage must be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by CCC with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by CCC. The recipient must inform CCC of the results of the inspection and indicate whether the damaged donated commodities are:

      (1) Fit for the use authorized in the agreement and, if so, whether there has been a diminution in quality; or

      (2) Unfit for the use authorized in the agreement.

      (f)(1) If a recipient has title to the donated commodities, the recipient must arrange for the recovery of that portion of the donated commodities designated as fit for the use authorized in the agreement. The recipient must dispose of donated commodities that are unfit for such use in the following order of priority:

      (i) Sale for the most appropriate use,  animal feed, fertilizer, industrial use, or another use approved by CCC, at the highest obtainable price;

      (ii) Donation to a governmental or charitable organization for use as animal feed or another non-food use; or

      (iii) Destruction of the donated commodities if they are unfit for any use, in such manner as to prevent their use for any purpose.

      (2) A recipient must arrange for all U.S. Government markings to be obliterated or removed before the donated commodities are transferred by sale or donation under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

      (g) A recipient may retain any proceeds generated by the disposal of the donated commodities in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section and must use the retained proceeds for expenses related to the disposal of the donated commodities and for activities specified in the agreement.

      (h) A recipient must notify CCC immediately and provide detailed information about the actions taken in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, including the quantities, values and dispositions of donated commodities determined to be unfit.

      § 1499.10   Claims for damage to or loss of donated commodities.

#### § § 1499.10

      (a) CCC will be responsible for claims arising out of damage to or loss of a quantity of the donated commodities prior to the transfer of title to the donated commodities to the recipient. The recipient will be responsible for claims arising out of damage to or loss of a quantity of the donated commodities while the recipient has title to the donated commodities.

      (b) If the recipient has title to donated commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the amount of the damage or loss is estimated to exceed $20,000, the recipient must:

      (1) Promptly upon discovery of the damage or loss, initiate a claim arising out of such damage or loss, including, if appropriate, initiating an action to collect pursuant to a commercial insurance contract;

      (2) Take all necessary action to pursue the claim diligently and within any applicable periods of limitations; and

      (3) Provide to CCC copies of all documentation relating to the claim.

      (c)(1) The value of a claim for lost donated commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by CCC with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by CCC.

      (2) The value of a claim for damaged donated commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by CCC with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by CCC, less any funds generated if such commodities are sold in accordance with § 1499.9(f)(1).

      (d) If CCC determines that a recipient has not initiated a claim or is not exercising due diligence in the pursuit of a claim, CCC may require the recipient to assign its rights to initiate or pursue the claim to CCC. Failure by the recipient to initiate a claim or exercise due diligence in the pursuit of a claim will be considered by CCC during the review of applications for subsequent food assistance awards.

      (e)(1) A recipient may retain any funds obtained as a result of a claims collection action initiated by it in accordance with this section, or recovered pursuant to any insurance policy or other similar form of indemnification, but such funds must be expended in accordance with the agreement or for other purposes approved in advance by CCC.

      (2) CCC will retain any funds obtained as a result of a claims collection action initiated by it under this section; provided, however, that if the recipient paid for the transportation of the donated commodities or a portion thereof, CCC will use a portion of such funds to reimburse the recipient for such expense on a prorated basis.

The account must be interest-bearing, unless one of the exceptions in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(8) applies or CCC determines that this requirement would constitute an undue burden. The recipient must comply with the requirements in § 1499.6(f)(7) with regard to the deposit of advance payments by CCC.

      (h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a recipient may make adjustments within the agreement budget between direct cost line items without further approval, provided that the total amount of such adjustments does not exceed the amount specified in the agreement. Adjustments beyond these limits require the prior approval of CCC.

      (2) A recipient must not transfer any funds budgeted for participant support costs, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, to other categories of expense without the prior approval of CCC.

      (i) A recipient may use sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income to purchase real or personal property only if local law permits the recipient to retain title to such property. However, a recipient must not use sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income to pay for the acquisition, development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that is:

      (1) Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious pursuits; or

      (2) Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes, except that a recipient may use sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income to pay for repairs to or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated commodities, but only if the structure is not used in whole or in part for any religious or sectarian purposes while the donated commodities are stored in it. If the use of sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income to pay for repairs to or rehabilitation of such a structure is not specifically provided for in the agreement, the recipient must not use the sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income for this purpose until it receives written approval from CCC.

      (j) A recipient must comply with 2 CFR 200.321 when procuring goods and services in the United States. When procuring goods and services outside of the United States, a recipient should endeavor to comply with 2 CFR 200.321 where practicable.

      (k) A recipient must enter into a written contract with each provider of goods, services, or construction work that is valued at or above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. Each such contract must require the provider to maintain adequate records to account for all donated commodities, funds, or both furnished to the provider by the recipient and to comply with any other applicable requirements that may be specified by CCC in the agreement. The recipient must submit a copy of each signed contract to CCC, as specified in the agreement.

      § 1499.12   Monitoring and evaluation requirements.

#### § § 1499.12

      (a) A recipient will be responsible for designing a performance monitoring plan for the project, obtaining written approval of the plan from CCC before putting it into effect, and managing and implementing the plan, unless otherwise specified in the agreement.

      (b) A recipient must establish baseline values, annual targets, and life of activity targets for each performance indicator included in the recipient's approved performance monitoring plan, unless otherwise specified in the agreement.

      (c) A recipient must inform CCC, in the manner and within the time period specified in the agreement, of any problems, delays, or adverse conditions that materially impair the recipient's ability to meet the objectives of the agreement. This notification must include a statement of any corrective actions taken or contemplated by the recipient, and any additional assistance requested from CCC to resolve the situation.

      (d) A recipient will be responsible for designing an evaluation plan for the project, obtaining written approval of the plan from CCC before putting it into effect, and arranging for an independent third party to implement the evaluation, unless otherwise specified in the agreement. This evaluation plan will detail the evaluation purpose and scope, key evaluation questions, evaluation methodology, time frame, evaluation management, and cost. This plan will generally be based upon the evaluation plan that the recipient submitted to CCC as part of its application, pursuant to § 1499.4(b)(6), unless the notice of funding opportunity specified that an evaluation plan was not required to be included in the application. The recipient must ensure that the evaluation plan:

      (1) Is designed using the most rigorous methodology that is appropriate and feasible, taking into account available resources, strategy, current knowledge and evaluation practices in the sector, and the implementing environment;

      (2) Is designed to inform management, activity implementation, and strategic decision-making;

      (3) Utilizes analytical approaches and methodologies, based on the questions to be addressed, project design, budgetary resources available, and level of rigor and evidence required, which may be implemented through methods such as case studies, surveys, quasi-experimental designs, randomized field experiments, cost-effectiveness analyses, implementation reviews, or a combination of methods;

      (4) Adheres to generally accepted evaluation standards and principles;

      (5) Uses participatory approaches that seek to include the perspectives of diverse parties and all relevant stakeholders; and

      (6) Where possible, utilizes local consultants and seeks to build local capacity in evaluation.

      (e)(1) Unless otherwise provided in the agreement, a recipient must arrange for evaluations of the project to be conducted by an independent third party that:

      (i) Is financially and legally separate from the recipient's organization; and

      (ii) Has staff with demonstrated methodological, cultural and language competencies, and specialized experience in conducting evaluations of international development programs involving agriculture, trade, education, and nutrition, provided that CCC may determine that, for a particular agreement, the staff of the independent third party evaluator is not required to have specialized experience in conducting evaluations of programs involving one or more of these four areas.

      (2) A recipient must provide a written certification to CCC that there is no real or apparent conflict of interest on the part of any recipient staff member or third party entity designated or hired to play a substantive role in the evaluation of activities under the agreement.

      (f) CCC will be considered a key stakeholder in all evaluations conducted as part of the agreement.

      (g)(1) A recipient is responsible for establishing the required financial and human capital resources for monitoring and evaluation of activities under the agreement. The recipient must maintain a separate budget for monitoring and evaluation, with separate budget line items for dedicated recipient monitoring and evaluation staff and independent third-party evaluation contracts.

      (2) Personnel at a recipient's headquarters offices and field offices with specialized expertise and experience in monitoring and evaluation may be used by the recipient for dedicated monitoring and evaluation. Unless otherwise specified in the agreement or approved evaluation plan, all evaluations must be managed by the recipient's evaluation experts outside of the recipient's line management for the activities.

      (h) CCC may independently conduct or commission an evaluation of a single agreement or an evaluation that includes multiple agreements. A recipient must cooperate, and comply with any demands for information or materials made in connection, with any evaluation conducted or commissioned by CCC. Such evaluations may be conducted by CCC internally or by a CCC-hired external evaluation contractor.

      § 1499.13   Reporting and record keeping requirements.

#### § § 1499.13

      (a) A recipient must comply with the performance and financial monitoring and reporting requirements in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.328 through 200.330.

      (b) A recipient must submit financial reports to CCC, by the dates and for the reporting periods specified in the agreement. Such reports must provide an accurate accounting of sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, interest, program income, and voluntary committed cost sharing or matching contributions. When reporting financial information under the agreement, the recipient must include the amounts in U.S. dollars and, if funds are held in local currency, the exchange rate.

      (c)(1) A recipient must submit performance reports to CCC, by the dates and for the reporting periods specified in the agreement. These reports must include the following:

      (i) The information required in 2 CFR 200.329(c)(2), including additional pertinent information regarding the recipient's progress, measured against established indicators, baseline values, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline values and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the recipient must provide an explanation in the report;

      (ii) Information covering the receipt, handling, and disposition of the donated commodities, until all of the donated commodities have been distributed, sold, or bartered and such disposition has been reported to CCC; and

      (iii) If the agreement authorizes the sale or barter of donated commodities, information covering the receipt and use of any sale proceeds, goods and services derived from barter, and program income, until all of the sale proceeds, goods and services derived from barter, and program income have been disbursed or used and reported to CCC.

      (2) A recipient must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to CCC in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, CCC may review the recipient's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The recipient must comply with all requests made by CCC or an entity designated by CCC in relation to such reviews.

      (d) Baseline, midterm, and final evaluation reports are required for all agreements, unless otherwise specified in the agreement. The reports must be submitted in accordance with the timeline in the CCC-approved evaluation plan. Evaluation reports submitted to CCC may be made public in an effort to increase accountability and transparency and share lessons learned and best practices.

      (e) A recipient must, within 30 days after export of all or a portion of the donated commodities, submit evidence of such export to CCC, in the manner set forth in the agreement. The evidence may be submitted through an electronic media approved by CCC or by providing the ocean carrier's on board bill of lading. The evidence of export must show the kind and quantity of commodities exported, the date of export, and the country where the commodities will be delivered. The date of export is the date that the ocean carrier carrying the donated commodities sails from the final U.S. load port.

      (f) If requested by CCC, a recipient must provide to CCC additional information or reports relating to the agreement.

      (g) If a recipient requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that CCC receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. CCC may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. CCC will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and make a decision based on the merits of each request. CCC will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.

      (h) A recipient must retain records and permit access to records in accordance with the requirements of 2 CFR 200.334 through 200.338. The date of submission of the final expenditure report, as referenced in 2 CFR 200.334, will be the date of submission of the final financial report required by paragraph (b) of this section, as prescribed by CCC. The recipient must retain copies of and make available to CCC all sales receipts, contracts, or other documents related to the sale or barter of donated commodities and any goods or services derived from such barter, as well as records of dispatch received from ocean carriers.

      § 1499.14   Subrecipients.

#### § § 1499.14

      (a) A recipient may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive donated commodities, sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the recipient for this purpose. The recipient must enter into a written subagreement with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.332. The recipient must provide a copy of each subagreement to CCC, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of any donated commodities, sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, or program income to the subrecipient.

      (b) A recipient must include the following requirements in a subagreement:

      (1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, CCC will make the determination.

      (2) The subrecipient is prohibited from using sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income to acquire goods and services, either directly or indirectly through another party, in a manner that violates a U.S. Government economic sanctions program, as specified in the agreement.

      (3) The subrecipient must pay to the recipient the value of any donated commodities, sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subagreement, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

      (4) The subrecipient is responsible for complying with the applicable compliance requirements set forth in the subaward in accordance with § 1499.18 and 2 CFR 200.501(h). Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

      (c) A recipient must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that donated commodities, sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subagreement and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.

> [81 FR 62605, Sept. 12, 2016, as amended at 84 FR 45060, Aug. 28, 2019; 87 FR 53368, Aug. 31, 2022]

      § 1499.15   Noncompliance with an agreement.

#### § § 1499.15

      If a recipient fails to comply with a Federal statute or regulation or the terms and conditions of the agreement, and CCC determines that the noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, CCC may take one or more of the actions set forth in 2 CFR 200.339 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the recipient. CCC may also initiate a claim against a recipient if the donated commodities are damaged or lost, or the sale proceeds, goods received through barter, CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income are misused or lost, due to an action or omission of the recipient.

> [81 FR 62605, Sept. 12, 2016, as amended at 87 FR 53368, Aug. 31, 2022]

      § 1499.16   Suspension and termination of agreements.

#### § § 1499.16

      (a) CCC may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:

      (1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340 for suspension or termination by CCC has been satisfied;

      (2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable; or

      (3) Storage facilities are inadequate to prevent spoilage or waste of the donated commodities, or distribution of the donated commodities will result in a substantial disincentive to or interference with domestic production or marketing in the target country.

      (b) The termination provisions in 2 CFR 200.340 and 200.341 will apply to an agreement.

      (c) If an agreement is terminated, the recipient:

      (1) Is responsible for the security and integrity of any undistributed donated commodities and must dispose of such commodities only as agreed to by CCC;

      (2) Is responsible for any sale proceeds, CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed and must use or return them only as agreed to by CCC; and

      (3) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout provisions specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.344 and 200.345.

> [81 FR 62605, Sept. 12, 2016, as amended at 84 FR 45060, Aug. 28, 2019; 87 FR 53368, Aug. 31, 2022]

      § 1499.17   Opportunities to object and appeals.

#### § § 1499.17

      (a) CCC will provide an opportunity to a recipient to object to, and provide information and documentation challenging, any action taken by CCC pursuant to § 1499.15. CCC will comply with any requirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient is entitled under any other statute or regulation applicable to the action involved. For example, if the action taken by CCC pursuant to § 1499.15 is to initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR parts 180 and 417, then the requirements in 2 CFR parts 180 and 417 will apply instead of the requirements in this section. In the absence of other applicable statutory or regulatory requirements, the requirements set forth in this section will apply.

      (b) The recipient must submit its objection in writing, along with any documentation, to the official specified in the agreement within 30 days after the date of CCC's written notification to the recipient of the CCC action being challenged. This official will endeavor to notify the recipient of his or her determination (the initial determination) within 60 days after the date that CCC received the recipient's written objection.

      (c) The recipient may appeal the initial determination to the Administrator, FAS. An appeal must be in writing and be submitted to the Office of the Administrator within 30 days after the date of the initial determination. The recipient may submit additional documentation with its appeal.

      (d) The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to make a determination within 60 days after the date that CCC received the appeal. The determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of CCC. The recipient must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by the Administrator.

      § 1499.18   Audit requirements.

#### § § 1499.18

      (a) Subpart F, Audit Requirements, of 2 CFR part 200 applies to recipients and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.

      (b) A recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a foreign organization, and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a recipient or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy this requirement:

      (1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subagreement, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one CCC program during such fiscal year; or

      (ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from CCC, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple CCC programs during such fiscal year; or

      (2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

      (c) A recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a foreign organization, and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.

      (d) CCC may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subagreement when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, CCC must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the recipient or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to CCC.

      (e) When a recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to CCC within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.

      (f) CCC, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any recipients or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Recipients and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If CCC conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, CCC will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).

      § 1499.19   Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § § 1499.19

      The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C.
