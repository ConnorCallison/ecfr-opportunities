#### § § 1303.101

    This part sets forth the policies and procedures of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (Board) regarding public access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. The provisions in the Act shall take precedence over any part of the Board's regulations in conflict with the Act. This part gives the procedures the public may use to inspect and obtain copies of Board records under the FOIA, including administrative procedures which must be exhausted before a request invokes the jurisdiction of an appropriate United States District Court for the Board's failure to respond to a proper request within the statutory time limits, for a denial of Board records or challenges to the adequacy of a search, or for denial of fee waiver.

    § 1303.105   Requests for Board records.

#### § § 1303.105

    (a) A written FOIA request must be submitted. You may:

    (1) Write: NWTRB Designated FOIA Officer, 2300 Clarendon Boulevard, Suite 1300, Arlington, VA 22201;

    (2) Send an e-mail request to  and specify that this is a FOIA request in the subject line; or

    (3) Fax: 703-235-4495.

    (b) When making a request for records about a person, Privacy Act regulations also may apply. Please check the regulations for additional requirements before submitting a request. When making a request for records about someone other than yourself, you must include either:

    (1) Written authorization signed by the person permitting you to see the records; or

    (2) Proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a death certificate or an obituary).

    (c) A request will be considered received for purposes of § 1303.107 on the date that it is received by the Board's FOIA office. For prompt handling, write “Freedom of Information Act Request” on the letter and envelope or in the subject line of the Web request or fax.

    (d) Each request must clearly describe the desired records in sufficient detail to enable Board personnel to locate them with reasonable effort. Response to requests may be delayed if the records are not clearly described.

    (e) Whenever possible, requests should include specific information about each record sought, such as date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject.

    (f) If the FOIA Officer determines that the request does not clearly describe the records sought, he or she will either advise you of the additional needed to locate the record or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. The requestor will then be given the opportunity to provide additional information or to modify their request.

    (g) Submitting a FOIA request shall be considered a commitment by the requestor to pay all applicable fees required under § 1303.108 unless the requestor seeks a waiver of fees. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay fees up to a specific amount.

    (h) The FOIA does not require the Board to:

    (1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records.

    (2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some time in the future.

    (3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the FOIA Officer must notify the requestor that the records have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of.

    § 1303.106   Responsibility, form, and content of responses.

#### § § 1303.106

    The Board's Executive Director of his/her designated FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record and determine appropriate fees. When determining which records are responsive to a request, the Board will include only records in its possession as of the date of the search.

    (a) If no records are responsive to the request, the FOIA Officer will notify the requestor in writing.

    (b) When a FOIA Officer denies a request in whole or in part he/she will notify the requestor in writing. The response will be signed by the FOIA Officer and will include:

    (1) The name and title or position of the person making the denial;

    (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including the FOIA exemption(s) that the FOIA Officer has relied on the denying the request; and

    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1303.114 and a description of the requirements of that section.

    (c)  When a request for a record not produced by the Board is received, the Board shall refer the requestor to the issuing agency in writing. The Board may hold records that contain or refer to non-public information obtained from other federal agencies (co-mingled records). If those co-mingled records are requested, the Board shall determine whether the portion of those records produced by the Board can be released. Before any portion of a co-mingled record is released, the Board shall redact the non-public information obtained from other federal agencies. The Board shall inform the requestor of the reason for the redaction and shall refer the requestor to the issuing agency in writing.

    (d)  When the Board refers all or part of a request to another agency, it shall give the requestor the address of the agency contact and the section(s) referred.

    (e)  The Board shall provide, within the FOIA deadline, responses only to those parts of the request not referred. Requests will be referred to other agencies and the requestor notified as soon as it is determined that a referral is appropriate.

    (f)  The Board may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.

    § 1303.107   Timing of responses to requests.

#### § § 1303.107

    (a)  The Board shall normally respond to requests in the order of their receipt.

    (b)  On receipt of a request, the Board shall send an acknowledgment letter or an e-mail confirming the requestor's agreement to pay fees under § 1303.108 and providing a request number for further reference.

    (c)  The Board shall have 20 business days from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny it. Once the Board determines whether it can grant a request entirely or in part, it shall notify the requestor in writing. The Board shall advise the requestor of any fees to be charged under § 1303.108 and shall disclose records promptly on payment of the fees. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also shall be indicated on the record when technically feasible.

    (d)

    (1) If the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “usual circumstances” as defined in the FOIA, the Board shall promptly notify the requestor in writing, explaining the circumstances and giving the date by which the request can be completed or if the Board cannot complete the request. If the extension is for more than 10 working days, the Board shall provide the requestor with an opportunity either to:

    (i) Modify the request so that it can be processed within the time limits; or

    (ii) Arrange an alternative time period for processing the original request.

    (2) If the Board believes that multiple requests submitted by a requestor or by requestors acting in concert constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and if the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.

    (e)

    (1) Requests and appeals shall be taken out of order and given expedited processing whenever it is determined that they involve:

    (i) Circumstances that could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

    (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged activity if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.

    (2) Requests for expedited processing may be made either at the time of the initial request or at a later time.

    (3) Requests for expedited processing must include a statement explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requestor under § 1303.108 must demonstrate that their professional activity involves news reporting or otherwise disseminating information to the public, although this need not be their sole occupation. A requestor also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally.

    (4) Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Board shall decide whether to grant the request and notify the requestor of its decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, an appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.

    § 1303.108   Fees.

#### § § 1303.108

    (a)  The Board shall charge for processing requests the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under § 1303.109 or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under § 1303.111. Fees must be paid before the copies of records are sent. Fees may be paid by check or money order payable to the Treasury of the United States.

    (b) Definitions for this section:

    (1) Commercial use request—A request from, or on behalf of, a person who seeks information for a purpose that furthers their commercial, trade, or profit interests including furthering those interests through litigation. The Board shall try to determine the use to which a record will be put. When the Board believes that a request is for commercial use either because of the nature of the request or because the Board has cause to doubt the stated use, the Board shall ask the requestor for clarification.

    (2) Direct costs—Expenses that the Board incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, for some requests, reviewing records in response to a FOIA. Direct costs include the full salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of duplication of the records. Overhead expenses, such as the costs of space, heating, and lighting, are not included.

    (3) Duplication—Making a copy of a record or the information in the record, to respond to a FOIA. Copies can be in paper, microform, electronic, or other format. The Board shall honor a requestor's preference for format if the record is readily reproducible in that format at a reasonable cost.

    (4) Educational institution—A public or private school, an undergraduate, graduate, professional or vocational school, that has a program of scholarly research. For a request to be in this category, a requestor must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of the qualifying institution and that the records will be used for scholarly research.

    (5) Noncommercial scientific institution—An institution that is not operated on a commercial basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is operated solely for conducting scientific research that does not promote any particular product or industry. For a request to be in this category, the requestor must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of the qualifying institution and that the records will be used to further scientific research.

    (6) Representative of the news media—Any person actively reporting for an entity that provides news to the public. The term “news” means information about current events or of current interest to the public. Examples include: Television and radio stations broadcasting to the public; and publishers of periodicals who make their news products available to the general public. For freelance journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a sold basis for expecting publication through that organization. The Board may use a publication contract or past publication records to make their determination. The requestor must not be seeking records for a commercial use; however, a request solely supporting the news-dissemination function is not considered a commercial use.

    (7) Review—Examining a record to determine whether any part of its is exempt from disclosure, and processing a record for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record is to disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under paragraph (c)(3) of this section but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    (8) Search—The process of looking for and retrieving records, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form. The Board shall ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive way that is reasonably possible.

    (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, the Board shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or a reduction of fees has been granted under § 1303.111:

    (1)  (i) _Search_ fees shall be charged for all requests subject to the limitations of § 1303.109. The Board may charge for time spent searching even if no responsive record is located, or if the record(s) located are withheld as exempt from disclosure.

    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record, the fee will be $5. If a search and retrieval requires the use of professional personnel the fee will be $8 for each quarter hour. If the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee will be $10 for each quarter hour.

    (iii) For computer searches of records, requestors will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requestors (see § 1303.109(a)) will be charged no search fee and certain other requestors (see § 1303.109(b)) will be entitled to two hours of manual search time without charge. Direct costs include the cost of operating a computer for the search time for requested records and the operator salary for the search.

    (2)  Duplication fees for paper copies of a record will be 10 cents per page for black and white and 20 cents per page for color. For all other forms of duplication, the Board shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy. All charges are subject to the limitations of § 1303.109 and § 1303.111.

    (3)  When a commercial use request is made, review fees shall be charged as stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. These fees apply only to the initial record review, when the Board determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record. Charges shall not be imposed for review at the administrative appeal level if an exemption is applied. However, records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies. The cost of that review shall be charged. All review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    § 1303.109   Restrictions on charging fees.

#### § § 1303.109

    (a) When determining search or review fees:

    (1) No search or review fee shall be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news media.

    (2) The Board shall provide without charge, to all but commercial users.

    (i) The first 100 pages of black and white duplication (or the cost equivalent); and

    (ii) The first two hours of search by a clerical staff member (or the cost equivalent).

    (3) When the total fee for a request will be $14.00 or less for any request, no fee shall be charged.

    (b) The Provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section work together. All requestors seeking records for a non-commercial use shall not be charged unless the total cost for the request exceeds by more than $14.00, the cost of a two hour clerical search, plus the cost of duplication over the 100 page exemption.

    § 1303.110   Notice of anticipated fees.

#### § § 1303.110

    (a)  The Board shall advise the requetor in writing of any applicable fees. If only a part of the fee can be estimated readily, the Board shall advise the requestor that this may be only a part of the total fee. After the requestor has been sent a fee estimate, the request shall not be considered received until the requestor makes a firm commitment to pay the anticipated total fee. Any such agreement must be made by the requestor in writing and must be received within 60 days of the Board's notice. If the requestor does not provide a firm commitment to pay the anticipated fee within 60 days of the notice, the request shall be closed. The requestor may be given an opportunity to work with the Board to change the requests and lower the cost.

    (b)  When the Board chooses as a matter of administrative discretion to provide a special service, such as certifying that records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail, the Board shall pay the costs of providing the service unless previous arrangements have been made with the requestor.

    (c)  The Board may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the Board. The Board shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended.

    (d)  If the Board reasonably believes that a requestor or a group of requestors acting together is trying to divide a request into a series of smaller requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Board may aggregate the requests and charge accordingly. The Board shall assume that multiple requests of the same type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. If requests are separated by a longer period, the Board shall aggregate them only if there is a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

    (e)  Where a requestor has previously failed to pay promptly a properly charged FOIA fee to the Board or another agency, the Board shall require proof that full payment has been made to that agency before it begins to process that requestor's FOIA. The Board shall also require advance payment of the full amount of the anticipated fee. When advance payment is required, the request is not considered received until payment has been made.

    § 1303.111   Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.

#### § § 1303.111

    (a) Records shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if the Board determined that:

    (1) Disclosure is in the public interest and the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the activities of the government; and

    (2) Disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.

    (b) In determining whether the first requirement is met, the Board shall consider:

    (1) Subject: Do the requested records concern identifiable activities of the federal government?

    (2) Informative value: Will the disclosure contribute to an understanding of government activities? Do records contain information on activities “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding? If the information or similar information is already in the public domain, the record(s) would not increase the public's understanding.

    (3) Would the disclosure contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor? A requestor's expertise in the subject and intention to convey information to the public shall be considered. Being a valid representative of the news media shall satisfy this consideration.

    (4) Is the disclosure likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities? The level of understanding after the disclosure versus that before the disclosure must be enhanced to a significant extent. However, the Board shall not make value judgments about whether information contributing to public understanding of government activities is important enough to release.

    (c) In determining whether the second requirement is met, the Board shall consider:

    (1) The existence and extent of the commercial interest: Would a commercial interest be substantially furthered by the disclosure? The Board shall consider the commercial interest (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of either the requestor or of any person on whose behalf they may be acting that would be furthered by the disclosure. During the administrative process, requestors shall be given an opportunity to provide additional information about this concern.

    (2) The primary interest for disclosure: Whether the commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison to the public interest, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.” A fee waiver is justified if the public interest standard under paragraph (b) of this section is satisfied and if that public interest is greater than any commercial interest. The Board shall presume that when news media requestors satisfy this standard, primarily the public interest is served.

    (d) If only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted only for those records.

    (e) Requests for a waiver or a reduction of fees must address the factors listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section only as they apply to each request. The Board also shall consider their administrative resources when responding to requests and may negotiate with the requestor to find the best way to optimize their resources in responding to the request when deciding whether to grant waivers or reductions of fees.

    § 1303.112   Denials.

#### § § 1303.112

    (a) When denying a request in any respect, the Board shall notify the requestor of that determination in writing. The types of denials include:

    (1) Denials of requests, consisting of a determination:

    (i) To withhold any requested record in whole or in part;

    (ii) That a requested record does not exist or cannot be located;

    (iii) That a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought;

    (iv) That what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; and

    (v) That the material requested is not a Board record (e.g., material produced by another agency or organization).

    (2) A determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver.

    (3) A denial of a request for expedited processing.

    (b) The denial letter shall be signed by the Director of Administration, the Deputy Director, or their designee, and shall include all of the following:

    (1) The name and title of the person responsible for the denial.

    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemptions applied in denying the request.

    (3) An estimate of the volume of records withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if it would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1303.114 and a description of the requirements of § 1303.114.

    § 1303.113   Business information.

#### § § 1303.113

    (a)  Business information obtained by the Board from a submitter shall be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section.

    (b)  For purposes of this section:

    (1) Business information—commercial or financial records obtained by the Board that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

    (2) Submitter—any person or entity from which the Board obtains business records, either directly or indirectly. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, and state, local, tribal, and foreign governments.

    (c)  Submitters of business information shall designate any part of the record considered to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA by appropriately marking the material. This may be done either at the time the record is submitted or at a reasonable time thereafter. This designation lasts for 10 years after submittal unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer period.

    (d)  The Board shall provide a business submitter with prompt written notice of any FOIA request or appeal that seeks its business information under paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, to give the submitter an opportunity to object to that disclosure under paragraph (f) of this section. The notice shall either describe the records requested or include copies of the records.

    (e)  Notice shall be given to a submitter when:

    (1) The submitter has designated that the information is considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA; or

    (2) The Board has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

    (f)(1)  A submitter shall have 30 days to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section. If a submitter has an objection to disclosure, they are required to submit a detailed written statement including:

    (i) All grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA, and

    (ii) In the case of Exemption 4, the reason why the information is a trade secret, commercial, or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

    (2) If a submitter fails to respond to the notice in paragraph (d) of the section within 30 days, the Board shall assume that the submitter has no objection to disclosure. The Board shall not consider information not received by the Board until after a disclosure decision has been made. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph might itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

    (g)  The Board shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the business records. Whenever the Board decides to disclose business records over the objection of a submitter, it shall give the submitter written notice, that will include:

    (1) A statement of the reason(s) the submitter's objections were not sustained;

    (2) A description of the business records to be disclosed; and

    (3) A specified disclosure date at a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.

    (h)  The notice requirements in paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:
