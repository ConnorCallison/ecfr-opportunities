In the event that the new owner's identification number cannot be legibly added to line 3 of the safety approval plate following the original owner's identification number, the new owner is authorized to put a new safety approval plate on the freight container provided that all the information contained on the original safety approval plate is retained in the owners files.

    PART 452—EXAMINATION OF CONTAINERS

### Part 452

**Authority:** Authority: 46 U.S.C. 80503; Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1.

      § 452.1   Periodic examination required.

#### § § 452.1

      (a) Except as provided for in § 452.7, each owner of an approved container subject to this part shall examine the container or have it examined in accordance with the procedures prescribed in § 452.3 at intervals of not more than 30 months, except that for containers approved as new containers, the interval from the date of manufacture to the date of the first examination must not exceed five years. For containers approved, examined and plated as existing containers before January 1, 1985 and containers approved and plated as new containers before January 1, 1985, the subsequent examination must be carried out in accordance with the following schedule:

      (b) Upon completion of an examination required by this part, the owner shall mark on the safety approval plate, or on the container itself as close as practicable to the safety approval plate, the month and year before which the container must next be examined. This marking must be on all containers by January 1, 1987. The marking may be by a decal, sticker, stencil, or other means so long as it is capable of remaining legible for at least 24 months. Affixing such a marking to a container that has not been examined in accordance with § 452.3 constitutes a misrepresentation in a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, and makes the owner punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

      (c) The owner of containers subject to this section shall have those containers examined in accordance with the program prescribed in this section regardless of whether the examinations are preformed within or outside the United States.

    PART 453—CONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT

### Part 453

**Authority:** Authority: 46 U.S.C. 80503; Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1.

      § 453.1   Unsafe and noncomplying containers subject to detention or control.

#### § § 453.1

      (a) Any container used in or offered for movement in international transport which does not have a valid safety approval plate attached to it is subject to detention or other control by a District Commander or Captain of the Port. However, upon receipt of evidence that a container which does not have a valid safety approval plate attached to it meets the standards of the convention, the District Commander or Captain of the Port may authorize limited movement of such container under conditions he deems appropriate. This paragraph becomes effective on January 3, 1979 for new containers and on January 1, 1985 for existing containers.

      (b) If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds that a container used in or offered for movement in international transport, even though it has a valid safety approval plate attached to it, is in a condition that creates an obvious risk to safety, he issues a detention order causing the container to be removed from service until it is restored to a safe condition. In addition to removing a container from transport, a detention order may require any special handling, including unloading prior to movement, necessary to ensure safety.

      (c) If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds that a container used or offered for movement in international transport has not been timely examined, the District Commander or Captain of the Port affixes to the container, at a place on the container where it will be readily noticeable to anyone loading or unloading the container, a mark or tag indicating that the container must be examined before being reloaded and again used in international transport. The mark or tag affixed by the District Commander or Captain of the Port indicates the place and the date on which it was affixed, and is capable of remaining legible and in place for at least 12 months. Such mark or tag must not be removed until the container is examined in accordance with § 452.3 of this subchapter. If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds that container marked or tagged as provided for in this paragraph was reloaded and used or offered for movement in international transport without having been examined, the District Commander or Captain of the Port issues a detention order causing the container to be removed from service until it is brought into compliance.

      (b) Written notice of any detention order or other order issued under § 453.1 is given immediately to the terminal operator, stevedore, or other person having actual control over the container involved.

      (b) The owner or the owner's agent shall notify the District Commander or Captain of the Port who issue the order, in writing, that the container has been brought into compliance. Upon giving such notice, the owner, or his agent, may return the container to service.

      (a) The owner, his agent, or the custodian of a container subject to a detention order or other order, may petition the Chief, Office of Operating and Environmental Standards (CG-OES), U.S. Coast Guard to review that order.

      (b) The Chief, Office of Operating and Environmental Standards (CG-OES), U.S. Coast Guard requires independent surveys to determine the extent of deficiencies, if necessary.
