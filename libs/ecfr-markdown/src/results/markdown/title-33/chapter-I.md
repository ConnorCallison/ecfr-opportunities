        § 136.115   Settlement and notice to claimant.

#### § § 136.115

        (a) Payment in full, or acceptance by the claimant of an offer of settlement by the Fund, is final and conclusive for all purposes and, upon payment, constitutes a release of the Fund for the claim. In addition, acceptance of any compensation from the Fund precludes the claimant from filing any subsequent action against any person to recover costs or damages which are the subject of the compensated claim. Acceptance of any compensation also constitutes an agreement by the claimant to assign to the Fund any rights, claims, and causes of action the claimant has against any person for the costs and damages which are the subject of the compensated claims and to cooperate reasonably with the Fund in any claim or action by the Fund against any person to recover the amounts paid by the Fund. The cooperation shall include, but is not limited to, immediately reimbursing the Fund for any compensation received from any other source for the same costs and damages and providing any documentation, evidence, testimony, and other support, as may be necessary for the Fund to recover from any person.

        (b) Claimant's failure to accept an offer of settlement within 60 days after the date the offer was mailed to the claimant automatically voids the offer. The Director, NPFC, reserves the right to revoke an offer at any time.

        (c) A claimant will be notified in writing sent by certified or registered mail whenever a claim against the Fund is denied. The failure of the Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim.

        (d) The Director, NPFC, upon written request of the claimant or of a person duly authorized to act on the claimant's behalf, reconsiders any claim denied. The request for reconsideration must be in writing and include the factual or legal grounds for the relief requested, providing any additional support for the claim. The request must be received by the Director, NPFC, within 60 days after the date the denial was mailed to the claimant or within 30 days after receipt of the denial by the claimant, whichever date is earlier. Reconsideration may only be requested once for each claim denied. The Director, NPFC will provide the claimant seeking reconsideration with written notification of the decision within 90 days after receipt of the request for reconsideration. This written decision is final. The failure of the Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a reconsideration within 90 days after it is received shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the reconsideration.

        (a) That the actions taken were necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate the effects of the incident;

        (b) That the removal costs were incurred as a result of these actions;

        (c) That the actions taken were determined by the FOSC to be consistent with the National Contingency Plan or were directed by the FOSC.

        § 136.205   Compensation allowable.

#### § § 136.205

        The amount of compensation allowable is the total of uncompensated reasonable removal costs of actions taken that were determined by the FOSC to be consistent with the National Contingency Plan or were directed by the FOSC.

#### § § 136.207

        (a) Claims for uncompensated natural resource damages may be presented by an appropriate natural resources trustee. However, in order to facilitate the processing of these claims with respect to a single incident where multiple trustees are involved and to prevent double recovery, the affected trustees should select a lead administrative trustee who will present consolidated claims on behalf of the trustees.

        (b) A trustee may present a claim for the reasonable cost of assessing natural resources damages separately from a claim for the cost of developing and implementing plans for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the natural resources damaged.

        (a) Submit the assessment and restoration plans which form the basis of the claim.

        (b) Provide documented costs and cost estimates for the claim. Final cost estimates for conducting damage assessments or implementing a restoration plan may form the basis for a claim against the Fund for an uncompensated natural resources damage claim.

        (c) Identify all trustees who may be potential claimants for the same natural resources damaged.

        (d) Certify the accuracy and integrity of any claim submitted to the Fund, and certify that any actions taken or proposed were or will be conducted in accordance with the Act and consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.

        (e) Certify whether the assessment was conducted in accordance with applicable provisions of the natural resources damage assessment regulations promulgated under section 1006(e)(1) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 2706(e)(1)). Identify any other or additional damage assessment regulations or methodology utilized.

        (f) Certify that, to the best of the trustee's knowledge and belief, no other trustee has the right to present a claim for the same natural resources damages and that payment of any subpart of the claim presented would not constitute a double recovery for the same natural resources damages.

        § 136.211   Compensation allowable.

#### § § 136.211

        (a) The amount of compensation allowable is the reasonable cost of assessing damages, and the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, or acquiring the equivalent of the damaged natural resources.

        (b) In addition to any other provision of law respecting the use of sums recovered for natural resources damages, trustees shall reimburse the Fund for any amounts received from the Fund in excess of that amount required to accomplish the activities for which the claim was paid.

        § 136.213   Authorized claimants.

#### § § 136.213

        (2) That the property was injured or destroyed;

        (3) The cost of repair or replacement; and

        (4) The value of the property both before and after injury occurred.

        (b) In addition, for each claim for economic loss resulting from destruction of real or personal property, the claimant must establish—

        (1) That the property was not available for use and, if it had been, the value of that use;

        (2) Whether or not substitute property was available and, if used, the costs thereof; and

        (3) That the economic loss claimed was incurred as the result of the injury to or destruction of the property.

        § 136.217   Compensation allowable.

#### § § 136.217

        (a) The amount of compensation allowable for damaged property is the lesser of—

        (1) Actual or estimated net cost of repairs necessary to restore the property to substantially the same condition which existed immediately before the damage;

        (2) The difference between value of the property before and after the damage; or

        (3) The replacement value.

        (b) Compensation for economic loss resulting from the destruction of real or personal property may be allowed in an amount equal to the reasonable costs actually incurred for use of substitute commercial property or, if substitute commercial property was not reasonably available, in an amount equal to the net economic loss which resulted from not having use of the property. When substitute commercial property was reasonably available, but not used, allowable compensation for loss of use is limited to the cost of the substitute commercial property, or the property lost, whichever is less. Compensation for loss of use of noncommercial property is not allowable.

        (c) Compensation for a claim for loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity under § 136.213(b) is limited to that allowable under § 136.235.

        § 136.219   Authorized claimants.

#### § § 136.219

        (a) A claim for loss of subsistence use of natural resources may be presented only by a claimant who actually uses, for subsistence, the natural resources which have been injured, destroyed, or lost, without regard to the ownership or management of the resources.

        (b) A claim for loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to loss of subsistence use of natural resources must be included as part of the claim under this section and must include the proof required under § 136.233.

      Subpart A—Introduction

        § 137.1   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 137.1

        (a) In general under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701, ), an owner or operator of a facility (as defined in § 137.10) that is the source of a discharge, or a substantial threat of discharge, of oil into the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone is liable for damages and removal costs resulting from the discharge or threat. However, if that person can demonstrate, among other criteria not addressed in this part, that they did not know and had no reason to know at the time of their acquisition of the real property on which the facility is located that oil was located on, in, or at the facility, the person may be eligible for the innocent landowner defense to liability under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4). One element of the defense is that the person made all appropriate inquiries into the nature of the real property on which the facility is located before acquiring it. The purpose of this part is to prescribe standards and practices for making those inquiries.

        (b) Under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4)(E), this part does not apply to real property purchased by a non-governmental entity or non-commercial entity for residential use or other similar uses where a property inspection and a title search reveal no basis for further investigation. In those cases, the property inspection and title search satisfy the requirements of this part.

        (c) This part does not affect the existing OPA 90 liability protections for State and local governments that acquire a property involuntarily in their functions as sovereigns under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(2)(B). Involuntary acquisition of properties by State and local governments fall under the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(2)(B), not under the all-appropriate-inquiries provision of 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4) and this part.

        § 137.5   Disclosure obligations.

#### § § 137.5

        (a) Under 33 U.S.C. 2703(c)(1), persons specified in § 137.1(a), including environmental professionals, must report the incident as required by law if they know or have reason to know of the incident.

        (b) This part does not limit or expand disclosure obligations under any Federal, State, tribal, or local law. It is the obligation of each person, including environmental professionals, conducting inquiries to determine his or her respective disclosure obligations under Federal, State, tribal, and local law and to comply with them.

        § 137.10   How are terms used in this part defined?

#### § § 137.10

        (a) The following terms have the same definitions as in 33 U.S.C. 2701: ; ; ;  or ; ; ; and

        (b) As used in this part—

        means a property that, because of its general disrepair or lack of activity, a reasonable person could believe that there is an intent on the part of the current owners to surrender their rights to the property.

        means real property the border of which is shared in part or in whole with that of the subject property or that would be shared in part or in whole with that of the property but for a street, road, or other public thoroughfare separating the properties.

        means a lack of, or inability to, obtain information required by subpart B of this part despite good faith efforts by the environmental professional or persons specified in § 137.1(a), as appropriate, to gather the information under § 137.33.

        means an individual who meets the requirements of § 137.25.

        means any structure, group of structures, equipment, or device (other than a vessel) which is used for one or more of the following purposes: exploring for, drilling for, producing, storing, handling, transferring, processing, or transporting oil. This term includes any motor vehicle, rolling stock, or pipeline used for one or more of these purposes.

        means the absence of any intention to seek an unfair advantage or to defraud another party; an honest and sincere intention to fulfill one's obligations in the conduct or transaction concerned.

        means non-engineered instruments, such as administrative and/or legal controls, that help to minimize the potential for human exposure to oil discharge and/or protect the integrity of a removal action.

        means participation in the performance of all-appropriate-inquiries investigations, environmental site assessments, or other site investigations that may include environmental analyses, investigations, and remediation which involve the understanding of surface and subsurface environmental conditions and the processes used to evaluate these conditions and for which professional judgment was used to develop opinions regarding conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

        § 137.65   Visual inspections of the facility, the real property on which the facility is located, and adjoining properties.

#### § § 137.65

        (a) For the purpose of achieving the objectives and performance factors of § 137.30(a) and (b), the inquiry of the environmental professional must include the following:

        (1) A visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, and the improvements at the facility and real property, including a visual inspection of the areas where oil may be or may have been used, stored, treated, handled, or disposed. Physical limitations to the visual inspection must be noted.

        (2) A visual inspection of adjoining properties, from the subject real property line, public rights-of-way, or other vantage point (e.g., aerial photography), including a visual inspection of areas where oil may be or may have been stored, treated, handled or disposed. A visual on-site inspection is recommended, though not required. Physical limitations to the inspection of adjacent properties must be noted.

        (b) Except as in paragraph (c) of this section, a visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located must be conducted.

        (c) An on-site inspection is not required if an on-site visual inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located cannot be performed because of physical limitations, remote and inaccessible location, or other inability to obtain access to the facility and the real property on which the facility is located after good faith efforts have been taken to obtain access. The mere refusal of a voluntary seller to provide access to the facility and the real property on which the facility is located is not justification for not conducting an on-site inspection. The inquiry of the environmental professional must include—

        (1) Visually inspecting the facility and the real property on which the facility is located using another method, such as aerial imagery for large properties, or visually inspecting the facility and the real property on which the facility is located from the nearest accessible vantage point, such as the property line or public road for small properties;

        (2) Documenting the efforts undertaken to obtain access and an explanation of why such efforts were unsuccessful; and

        (3) Documenting other sources of information regarding the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located that were consulted according to § 137.30(a). The documentation should include comments, if any, by the environmental professional on the significance of the failure to conduct a visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located with regard to the ability to identify conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property.

        § 137.70   Specialized knowledge or experience on the part of persons specified in § 137.1(a).

#### § § 137.70

        (a) For the purpose of identifying conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, persons specified in § 137.1(a) must take into account their own specialized knowledge of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, the area surrounding the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, and the conditions of adjoining properties and their experience relevant to the inquiry.

        (b) The results of all appropriate inquiries under § 137.33 must take into account the relevant and applicable specialized knowledge and experience of the persons specified in § 137.1(a) responsible for undertaking the inquiry.

        § 137.75   The relationship of the purchase price to the value of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, if oil was not at the facility or on the real property.

#### § § 137.75

        (a) Persons specified in § 137.1(a) must consider whether the purchase price of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located reasonably reflects the fair market value of the facility and real property if oil was not present or likely present.

        (b) If the persons conclude that the purchase price does not reasonably reflect the fair market value of that facility and real property if oil was not at the facility and the real property, they must consider whether or not the differential in purchase price and fair market value is due to the presence or likely presence of oil.

        § 137.80   Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

#### § § 137.80

        (a) Throughout the inquiries, persons specified in § 137.1(a) and environmental professionals conducting the inquiry must take into account commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information within the local community about the facility and the real property on which the facility is located and consider that information when seeking to identify conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property.

        (b) Commonly known information may include information obtained by the person specified in § 137.1(a) or by the environmental professional about the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located that is incidental to the information obtained during the inquiry of the environmental professional.

        (c) To the extent necessary to achieve the objectives and performance factors of § 137.30(a) and (b), the person specified in § 137.1(a) and the environmental professional must gather information from varied sources whose input either individually or taken together may provide commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the facility and the real property on which the facility is located; the environmental professional may refer to one or more of the following sources of information:

        (1) Current owners or occupants of neighboring properties or properties adjacent to the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

        (2) Local and state government officials who may have knowledge of, or information related to, the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

        (3) Others with knowledge of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

        (4) Other sources of information, such as newspapers, Web sites, community organizations, local libraries, and historical societies.

        § 137.85   The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located and the ability to detect the oil by appropriate investigation.

#### § § 137.85

        (a) Persons specified in § 137.1(a) and environmental professionals conducting an inquiry of a facility and the real property on which it is located on their behalf must take into account the information collected under §§ 137.45 through 137.80 in considering the degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located.

        (b) Persons specified in § 137.1(a) and environmental professionals conducting an inquiry of a facility and the property on which the facility is located on their behalf must take into account the information collected under §§ 137.45 through 137.80 in considering the ability to detect the presence or likely presence of oil by appropriate investigation. The report of the environmental professional should include an opinion under § 137.35(c)(4) regarding whether additional appropriate investigation is necessary.

A _Master Certificate_ covers, automatically, all of the vessels subject to this subpart held by the COFR Operator solely for purposes of construction, repair, scrapping, sale or lease. A vessel which is being operated commercially in any business venture, including the business of building, repairing, scrapping, leasing, or selling (for example, a slop barge used by a shipyard) cannot be covered by a Master Certificate and must have either a current Individual Certificate or, if applicable, a current Fleet Certificate.

        means the amount of all assets located in the United States, less all liabilities anywhere in the world.

        means the U.S. Coast Guard, National Pollution Funds Center. _NPFC_ is the U.S. Government office responsible for administering the OPA 90 and CERCLA vessel COFR program.

        has the same meaning as set forth in 46 U.S.C. 2101.

        means the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2701, ).

        means a vessel owned or demise chartered and operated by the United States, by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by a foreign nation, except when the vessel is engaged in commerce.

        for purposes of this subpart, means a release as defined in CERCLA (specifically, 42 U.S.C. 9601), or a threatened release, of a hazardous substance.

        for purposes of OPA 90 evidence of financial responsibility, has the same meaning as defined at 33 U.S.C. 2701; and, for purposes of CERCLA evidence of financial responsibility, means any person who is an “owner or operator,” as defined at 42 U.S.C. 9601, including any person chartering a vessel by demise.

        means a COFR Operator providing evidence of financial responsibility as the responsible party of the subject vessel, as provided under § 138.110(d). A self-insurer is distinct from a guarantor.

        means an evidence of financial responsibility amount that must be demonstrated under this subpart, determined as provided in § 138.100.

        means the amount of current assets located in the United States, less all current liabilities anywhere in the world.

#### § § 138.40

        (a)  The COFR Operator of a vessel must establish and maintain (or cause to be established and maintained) evidence of financial responsibility acceptable to the Director using any one of the methods specified in § 138.110, in an amount equal to or greater than the total applicable amount determined under § 138.100 and, in the case of a financial guarantor, as further provided under § 138.110(c)(2) (aggregation of total applicable amounts). The evidence of financial responsibility required by this paragraph must be—

        (1) Established as of the date they become a responsible party; and

        (2) Continuously maintained for so long as they remain a responsible party.

        § 138.50   How to apply vessel gross tonnages.

#### § § 138.50

        (a)  This section sets forth the methods for applying vessel gross tonnage to—

        (1) Determine whether a vessel exceeds the 100 or 300 gross ton threshold under § 138.20 and OPA 90, CERCLA, or both;

        (2) Calculate the OPA 90 and CERCLA applicable amounts of financial responsibility required, as provided in § 138.100; and

        (3) Determine the OPA 90 limit of liability under subpart B of this part in the event of an oil pollution incident, and the CERCLA limit of liability under 42 U.S.C. 9607 in the event of a hazardous substance release.

        (b)  For a vessel assigned both gross tonnage ITC (GT ITC) and gross register tonnage (GRT) under 46 CFR part 69, apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20 using the assigned GRT tonnage, and determine the applicable amounts of financial responsibility and the limits of liability using the assigned GT ITC tonnage.

        (c)  For a vessel assigned only a GT ITC or a GRT tonnage under 46 CFR part 69, apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20, and determine the applicable amounts of evidence of financial responsibility and the limits of liability using the assigned GT ITC or GRT tonnage.

        (d)  For a vessel assigned a high and low GRT tonnage under 46 CFR part 69, subpart D (Dual Regulatory Measurement System), apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20, and determine the applicable amounts of financial responsibility and the limits of liability, using the high GRT tonnage.

        (e)  The use of assigned gross tonnages, as required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, is summarized in the following table.

        (f)  In the event of an incident or release, the responsible parties and guarantors are governed by the vessel's assigned gross tonnage on the date of the incident. This is as determined under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section and evidenced on the appropriate tonnage certifying document as provided for under the U.S. tonnage regulations or international conventions (for example, tonnage certificate or completed Simplified measurement application, International Tonnage Certificate (1969)), regardless of what gross tonnage is specified in the Application or guaranty form submitted under this subpart, except when the responsible parties or guarantors knew or should have known that the tonnage certificate information was incorrect (see also § 138.110(h)(1)(iii)).

        (g)  Each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, or other authorized United States Government official, upon request, for examination and copying, the original or an unaltered and legible electronic copy of the vessel's applicable tonnage certifying document(s).

        § 138.80   Applying for COFRs.

#### § § 138.80

        (a)  To apply for a COFR of any type, the COFR Operator must—

        (1) Submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, by one of the submission methods provided in § 138.60(c):

        (i) An Application;

        (A) For an Individual Certificate, list the name of the covered vessel, and the vessel's gross tonnage information, including the measurement system(s) used on the application;

        (B) For a Fleet Certificate, instead of listing each individual barge, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Fleet Certificate. The largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT GROSS TONNAGE] GRT”; and

        (C) For a Master Certificate, instead of listing each individual vessel, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Master Certificate. The largest tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable. The largest vessel other than a tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable.”

        (ii) The evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110;

        (A) For a Fleet Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount, determined as provided in § 138.100, for the largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered.

        (B) For a Master Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount determined as provided in § 138.100 for the largest tank vessel and largest non-tank vessel to be covered by the Master Certificate.

        (iii) The agent for service of process designations required by § 138.130; and

        (iv) All other supporting documentation required by this subpart.

        (A) At the time of Application for a Master Certificate, the COFR Operator must submit a report to the Director, indicating: the name; previous name, if applicable; type; gross tonnage and measurement system(s) used, for each vessel covered by the Master Certificate, indicating which vessels, if any, are tank vessels. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT tonnage, specify both gross tonnages.

        (B) Six months after receiving a Master Certificate, and every 6 months thereafter, each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, an updated report, separately listing the vessels no longer covered by that Master Certificate. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT, both gross tonnages must be specified. If a vessel has been transferred to another responsible party and the COFR Operator to whom the Master Certificate was issued ceases to be the vessel's operator, the COFR Operator must report the date and place of the transfer, and the name and contact information of the responsible party to whom the vessel was transferred. If the vessels covered by the Master Certificate have not changed from the previous report, the COFR Operator may submit an updated report that indicates no change from previous report.

        (2) Pay, or cause to be paid, all fees required by § 138.120.

        (b)  The Director must receive the Application, evidence of financial responsibility, and other required supporting documentation, at least 21 days prior to the date the Certificate is required. The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day submission deadline only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).

        (c)  COFR Operators may create an Application using the online eCOFR web process (located at ) or, if not using eCOFR, may obtain an “Application for Vessel Certificate of Financial Responsibility (Water Pollution)” at the same website.

        (d)  (1) The COFR Operator must complete and either verify the Application in eCOFR as provided in § 138.60(c)(1)(i) or, if not using eCOFR, sign and date the hard-copy signature page of the Application and submit the signed Application to the Director, by one of the methods specified in § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) through (iv).

        (2) The Application must include the title of the person signing it.

        (3) If the person signing the Application is acting under a Power of Attorney, they must include a copy of the Power of Attorney with the Application.

        (e)  The COFR Operator must report any changes to the Application to the Director in writing, no later than 5 business days after discovery of the change. The Director may require that the COFR Operator submit a revised Application and provide additional evidence of financial responsibility, and pay any additional fees required by § 138.120.

        (f)  Before operating a barge or vessel that exceeds the maximum gross tonnage indicated on the COFR, the COFR Operator must:

        (1) Submit a new or amended Application, or a written request to supplement the Application, to reflect the new maximum gross tonnages on the COFR;

        (2) Unless the COFR Operator qualifies as a self-insurer at the higher total applicable amount, submit, or cause to be submitted, evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110 to the Director, demonstrating increased coverage based on the new maximum gross tonnage; and

        (3) Pay a new certification fee, as required by § 138.120.

        § 138.90   Renewing COFRs.

#### § § 138.90

        (a) The COFR Operator must submit a request for COFR renewal to the NPFC at least 21 days, but no earlier than 90 days, before the expiration date of the current COFR.

        (b) The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day request for COFR renewal submission deadline in paragraph (a) of this section only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).

        (c) The COFR Operator must identify in the request for COFR renewal all changes to the information contained in the initial Application, including the gross ton measurement system(s) used (if not previously provided), the evidence of financial responsibility, and all other supporting documentation previously submitted to the Director, as provided in § 138.150.

        § 138.100   How to calculate a total applicable amount.

#### § § 138.100

        The total applicable amount is the sum of the OPA 90 applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section plus the CERCLA applicable amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (a)  The applicable amount under OPA 90 is equal to the applicable limit of liability determined as provided in subpart B of this part.

        (b)  The applicable amount under CERCLA is determined as follows:

        (1) For a vessel over 300 gross tons carrying a hazardous substance as cargo, and for any vessel covered under § 138.110(c)(3) or (d)(2)(ii) (calculation of CERCLA applicable amounts for financial guarantors and self-insurers), the greater of $5,000,000 or $300 per gross ton.

        (2) For any other vessel over 300 gross tons, the greater of $500,000 or $300 per gross ton.

        (c)  If an applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is amended by statute or regulation, the COFR Operator must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in an amount equal to or greater than the amended total applicable amount, as provided in § 138.240(a).

        (d)  The responsible parties are strictly, jointly and severally liable, for the costs and damages resulting from an incident or a release, but together they need only establish and maintain an amount of financial responsibility equal to the single limit of liability per incident or release. Only that portion of the evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart with respect to—

        (1) OPA 90 is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to an incident where there is not also a release; and

        (2) CERCLA is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to a release where there is not also an incident. A guarantor (or a self-insurer for whom the exceptions to a limitations of liability are not applicable), therefore, is not required to apply the entire amount of financial responsibility to an incident involving oil alone or a release involving a hazardous substance alone.

        § 138.110   How to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility.

#### § § 138.110

        (a)  The COFR Operator of each vessel must submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, the evidence of financial responsibility required by § 138.40(a) using one of the methods specified in this section.

        (1) If submitted on behalf of the COFR Operator, the guarantor must provide evidence of financial responsibility to the Director.

        (2) The effective and termination dates are as follows:

        (3) Termination provisions:

        (i) The guarantor must specify the reason for terminating the guaranty in the notice required by this paragraph, if known.

        (ii) Termination of the guaranty as to any covered vessel will not affect the liability of the guarantor in connection with an incident or release commencing or occurring prior to the effective date of the guaranty termination.

        (4) If, at any time, the information contained in the evidence of financial responsibility submitted under this section changes, or there is a material change in a guarantor or self-insurer's financial position, the guarantor or COFR Operator or self-insurer (as applicable), must report the change to the Director, as provided in § 138.150.

        (b)  The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the insurance guaranty method by submitting an Insurance Guaranty Form to the Director.

        (1) Each form must be executed by no more than four COFR insurance guarantors accepted by the Director. A lead underwriter is considered one of the COFR insurance guarantors.

        (2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a COFR insurance guarantor is as follows:

        (i) The COFR insurance guarantor must request an initial determination by the Director of the COFR insurance guarantor's acceptability to serve as a COFR insurance guarantor under this subpart, at least 90 days before the date a COFR is required, by submitting information describing the COFR insurance guarantor's structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, and such other information as may be requested by the Director.

        (ii) The Director reviews the continued acceptability of COFR insurance guarantors annually. Each COFR insurance guarantor must submit updates to the initial request submitted under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, annually, within 90 days after the close of the COFR insurance guarantor's fiscal year, describing any material changes to the COFR insurance guarantor's legal status, structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, since the previous year's submission, and providing such other information as may be requested by the Director.

        (c)  The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the financial guaranty method by submitting a Financial Guaranty Form to the Director.

        (1) Each form must be executed by no more than four financial guarantors accepted by the Director, at least one of which must be a parent or affiliate of the COFR Operator. ( paragraph (g) of this section for additional requirements if more than one financial guarantor signs the form.)

        (2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a financial guarantor is as follows:

        (i) The financial guarantor must comply with the self-insurance provisions in paragraph (d) of this section, and the periodic reporting requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.

        (ii) The financial guarantor must also demonstrate that it maintains net worth and working capital, each in amounts equal to or greater than—

        (A) The aggregate total applicable amounts, calculated for each COFR Operator vessel for which the financial guaranty is being provided, based on each such COFR Operator's vessel with the greatest total applicable amount, plus—

        (B) The total applicable amount required to be demonstrated by a self-insurer under this subpart if the financial guarantor is also acting as a self-insurer.

        (3) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.

        (d)  The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the self-insurance method as follows:

        (1) Submit to the Director the financial statements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section for the fiscal year preceding the date the COFR Operator signs the Application or request for COFR renewal.

        (2) Demonstrate that the COFR Operator maintains, in the United States, working capital and net worth, each in amounts equal to or greater than the total applicable amount, calculated as follows:

        (i) If the self-insurer has multiple vessels, calculate the total applicable amount based on the vessel with the greatest total applicable amount.

        (ii) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.

        (e)  (1) Each self-insurer and financial guarantor must submit the following reports to the Director with the Application and annually thereafter, within the deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section:

        (i) Submit the self-insurer or financial guarantor's annual, current, and audited non-consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.

        (ii) Accompany the financial statements with a declaration from the self-insurer or financial guarantor's chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official, certifying the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets, and the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total assets included in the accompanying balance sheet, which are located in the United States.

        (iii) If the financial statements cannot be submitted in non-consolidated form, submit a consolidated statement accompanied by an additional declaration prepared by the same Certified Public Accountant—

        (A) Verifying the amount by which the total assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) liabilities, and the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) current liabilities;

        (B) Specifically naming the self-insurer or financial guarantor;

        (C) Confirming that the amounts so verified relate only to the self-insurer or financial guarantor, apart from any parent or other affiliated entity; and

        (D) Identifying the consolidated financial statement to which it applies.

        (2) When the self-insurer or financial guarantor's demonstrated net worth is not at least ten times the cumulative total applicable amounts, their chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official must submit to the Director with the Application and semi-annually thereafter, within the deadline specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, an affidavit stating that neither their working capital nor net worth fell during the first 6 months of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current fiscal year, below the cumulative total applicable amounts.

        (3) All self-insurers and financial guarantors must—

        (i) Submit, upon the Director's request, additional financial information within the time specified; and

        (ii) Notify the Director in writing within 5 days following the date the self-insurer or financial guarantor knows, or has reason to know, that its working capital or net worth has fallen below the total applicable amounts.

        (4) All required annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the close of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's fiscal year. All required semi-annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 30 days after the close of the applicable 6-month period. The Director will grant an extension of the time limits for submissions under this paragraph only as provided in § 138.60(e).

        (5) A failure by a self-insurer or financial guarantor to timely submit to the Director any statement, data, notification, or other submission required may result in the Director denying or revoking the COFR, and may prompt enforcement action as provided under § 138.170.

        (6) The Director may waive the working capital requirement for any self-insurer or financial guarantor that—

        (i) Is a regulated public utility, a municipal or higher-level governmental entity, or an entity operating solely as a charitable, non-profit organization qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)), provided that the self-insurer or financial guarantor demonstrates in writing that the waiver would benefit a local public interest; or

        (ii) Demonstrates in writing that working capital is not a significant factor in the self-insurer or financial guarantor's financial condition, in which case the self-insurer or financial guarantor's net worth in relation to the required cumulative total applicable amounts, and a history of stable operations, are the major elements considered by the Director.

        (f)  (1) The COFR Operator may request that the Director accept a guaranty method for establishing evidence of financial responsibility that is different from one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section as follows:

        (i) The COFR Operator must submit the request to the Director in writing, at least 90 days prior to the date the COFR is required.

        (ii) The request must describe in detail: The method proposed; the reasons why the COFR Operator does not wish to (or is unable to) use one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; and how the proposed guaranty method assures that the vessel's responsible parties have the financial ability to meet their potential liabilities under OPA 90 and CERCLA in the event of an incident or a release.

        (iii) Each COFR Operator making a request under this paragraph must provide the Director a proposed guaranty form that includes all the elements described in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.

        (2) The Director will not accept a self-insurance method other than the one described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Director also will not accept a guaranty method under this paragraph that merely deletes or alters a requirement or provision of one of the guaranty methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section (for example, one that alters the termination clause of the Insurance Guaranty).

        (3) A Director's decision to accept an alternative guaranty method of establishing evidence of financial responsibility under this paragraph is final agency action.

        (g)  If more than one guarantor executes the relevant guaranty form, the following rules apply:

        (1) If a guarantor's percentage of vertical participation is specified on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor is subject to direct action and is liable for the payment of costs and damages under OPA 90 or CERCLA, as applicable, only in accordance with the percentage of vertical participation so specified for that guarantor.

        (2) Participation in the form of layering (tiers, one in excess of another) is not permitted. Only vertical participation on a percentage basis and participation with no specified percentage allocation is acceptable.

        (3) If no percentage of vertical participation is specified for a guarantor on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor's liability is joint and several for the total of the unspecified portion.

        (4) The participating guarantors must designate a lead guarantor having authority to bind all of the participating guarantors for actions required of guarantors under OPA 90 or CERCLA and this subpart, including but not limited to reporting changes in the evidence of financial responsibility as provided in § 138.150(d), receipt of source designations, advertisement of source designations and the responsible party's claims procedures, and receipt and settlement of claims.

        (h)  (1) Each guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility must submit to the Director a written acknowledgment by the guarantor that a claimant (including a claimant by right of subrogation) may assert any claim for costs or damages arising under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, directly against the guarantor, regardless of whether the claim is asserted in an action in court or other proceeding. The guarantor must also acknowledge that, in the event a claim is asserted directly against the guarantor under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, the guarantor may invoke only the following rights and defenses—

        (i) The incident, release, or both, were caused by the willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided;

        (ii) All rights and defenses, which would be available to the responsible party under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, as applicable;

        (iii) A defense that the amount of the claim, or all claims asserted with respect to the same incident or release, whether asserted in court or in any other proceeding, exceeds the amount of the guaranty, except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the applicable tonnage certificate was incorrect (see § 138.50(f)); and

        (iv) The claim is not one made under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.

        (2) Except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the evidence of financial responsibility or applicable tonnage certificate is incorrect (see § 138.50(f)), a guarantor who provides evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart will be liable, with respect to any one incident or release, or both, as applicable, only for the amount of costs and damages specified in the evidence of financial responsibility.

        (3) A guarantor will not be considered to have consented to direct action under any law other than OPA 90 or CERCLA, or to unlimited liability under any law or in any venue, solely because the guarantor has provided evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart.

        (4) In the event of any finding that the liability of a guarantor under OPA 90 or CERCLA exceeds the amount of the guaranty provided under this subpart, that guaranty is considered null and void with respect to that excess.

        (i)  If the Director intends to disapprove or revoke the approval of a guarantor (for example, due to the guarantor's change in financial position), the Director will notify the COFR Operator of the need to establish new evidence of financial responsibility within a specified period.

        (1) If the COFR Operator establishes, or causes to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Application if otherwise complete will be approved or the COFR will remain in effect, and the COFR Operator will not have to pay a new Application fee or certification fee.

        (2) If the COFR Operator fails to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Director may deny or revoke the COFR and, if revoked, the COFR Operator will have to apply for a new COFR and pay a new certification fee. The COFR Operator's failure to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director may also result in enforcement as provided under § 138.170.

        § 138.120   Fees.

#### § § 138.120

        (a)  Each COFR Operator applying for a COFR, or requesting a COFR renewal, must pay the fees required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as follows:

        (1) All fees required by this section must be paid in United States dollars.

        (2) For COFR Operators using eCOFR as provided under § 138.60(c)(1)(i), credit card payment is required.

        (3) For COFR Operators submitting Applications and requests for COFR renewal under § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) through (iv) (email, fax, and mail submissions), the fees must be paid by a check, cashier's check, draft, or postal money order, made payable to the “U.S. Coast Guard”. Cash payments will not be accepted.

        (i) For Applications and requests for COFR renewal submitted under § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) (email and fax submissions, respectively), all fee payments must be received by the Director no later than 21 days following submission of the Application or request for COFR renewal.

        (ii) For Applications and requests for COFR renewal submitted under § 138.60(c)(1)(iv) (mail submissions), all fee payments must be enclosed with the Application or request for COFR renewal.

        (4) Any failure to timely pay the fees required by this section may result in COFR denial or revocation, debt collection (see 6 CFR part 11, 44 CFR part 11, and 31 CFR parts 285, and 900 through 904), and such other enforcement under § 138.170 as may be appropriate.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the COFR Operator must pay a non-refundable Application fee of $200 for each Application submitted under this subpart (for each Application for one or more Individual Certificates, for a Fleet Certificate, or for a Master Certificate).

        (2) An Application fee is not required when the COFR Operator submits—

        (i) A request for an additional Individual Certificate under an existing Application;

        (ii) A request to amend an Application;

        (iii) A request for Certificate renewal; or

        (iv) A request to reinstate a Certificate, if submitted within 90 days following the Certificate's revocation.

        (c)  In addition to the Application fees required by paragraph (b) of this section, each COFR Operator who submits an Application or request for COFR renewal must pay the following certification fees:

        (1) $100 for each vessel listed in, or added to, an Application for one or more Individual Certificates;

        (2) $100 for each Application for a Fleet Certificate or Master Certificate; and

        (3) $100 for each request for renewal of an Individual Certificate, a Fleet Certificate or a Master Certificate.

        (d)  (1) A certification fee will be refunded, upon receipt by the Director of a written request, if the Application or request for COFR renewal is denied by the Director, or if the Application is withdrawn by the COFR Operator before the Director issues the COFR.

        (2) Overpayments of Application and certification fees will be refunded to the COFR Operator.

        § 138.130   Agents for Service of process.

#### § § 138.130

        (a)  Each COFR Operator and guarantor must designate on the forms submitted a person located in the United States as its U.S. agent for service of process and (in the event of an incident, a release, or both) for receipt of notices of source designation, claims presented under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, and lawsuits brought under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.

        (b)  Each U.S. agent for service of process designated under paragraph (a) must acknowledge the agency designation in writing unless the agent has already submitted a written master (that is, blanket) agency acknowledgment to the Director showing that the agent has agreed in advance to act as the U.S. agent for service of process for the COFR Operator or guarantor in question.

        (c)  A COFR Operator or guarantor may change a designated U.S. agent for service of process, at any time and for any reason, by submitting a new U.S. agent for service of process designation in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (a), and by causing the new U.S. agent for service of process to submit the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d)  In the event a designated U.S. agent for service of process becomes unavailable at any time, for any reason, the COFR Operator or guarantor must designate a new U.S. agent for service of process in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (a), within 5 days of the COFR Operator or guarantor becoming aware of such unavailability. In addition, the new U.S. agent for service of process must submit to the Director the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.

        (e)  If a designated U.S. agent for service of process cannot be served, then service of process on the Director, as provided in this paragraph, will constitute valid service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor. Service of process on the Director will not be effective unless the server—

        (1) Has sent a copy of each document served on the Director to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as applicable, by registered mail, at the COFR Operator or guarantor's last known address on file with the Director;

        (2) Indicates, at the time process is served upon the Director, that the purpose of the mailing is to effect service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor; and

        (3) Provides evidence acceptable to the Director at the time process is served upon the Director, that service was attempted on the designated U.S. agent for service of process but failed, stating the reasons why service on the U.S. agent for service of process was not possible, and that the document was sent to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        § 138.140   Application withdrawals, COFR denials and revocations.

#### § § 138.140

        (a)  A COFR Operator, or anyone authorized to act on their behalf, may withdraw an Application at any time prior to issuance of the COFR.

        (b)  The Director may deny an Application or revoke a COFR, and the United States may initiate enforcement under § 138.170, for any failure to comply with the requirements of this subpart, including—

        (1) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, makes a false statement in, or in connection with, any submission required by this subpart;

        (2) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, fails to establish or maintain acceptable evidence of financial responsibility, as required by this subpart;

        (3) If the COFR Operator fails to pay the Application and certification fees required by § 138.120;

        (4) If the COFR Operator or guarantor fails to designate and maintain a U.S. agent for service of process as required by § 138.130;

        (5) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, fails to comply with, or respond to, lawful inquiries, regulations, or orders of the U.S. Coast Guard pertaining to the activities subject to this subpart;

        (6) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, fails to timely report information required to be reported to the Director under this subpart, including failing to timely submit to the Director statements, data, financial information, notifications, affidavits, or other submissions required by this subpart; or

        (7) If the Director obtains information indicating that the Application should be denied or that a new COFR is required (for example, a permanent vessel transfer, new COFR Operator, vessel renaming, guaranty termination, disapproval of a guarantor).

        (c)  If a COFR is revoked by the Director under paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on the expiration of 30 days following the date the Director receives a guarantor's notice of termination as provided under §§ 138.110(a)(3) and 138.150(d), the Director may reinstate the COFR if the guarantor promptly notifies the Director following the revocation that the guarantor rescinded the termination and that there was no gap in guarantor coverage.

        (d)  If the Director obtains information indicating that an Application should be denied or that a COFR should be revoked for reasons that the COFR Operator may not be aware of, the Director will notify the COFR Operator, in writing, stating the reason for the intended action.

        (1) A notice from the Director that an Application is incomplete will be considered a denial unless the Application is completed by the COFR Operator within the period specified in the notice. A COFR subject to revocation remains valid until the COFR is revoked as provided in § 138.140(d)(2) and (3).

        (2) If the Director issues a notice of intent to deny an Application or revoke a COFR due to a violation under paragraph (b) of this section, the COFR Operator may demonstrate compliance to the Director in writing by no later than the date specified by the Director in the notice. If the COFR Operator demonstrates compliance by that date, the Application will remain under consideration, and any current COFR will remain in effect, unless and until the Director issues a written decision denying the Application or revoking the COFR, as applicable. Otherwise, the Application denial or COFR revocation is effective as of the date specified by the notice.

        (3) The denial of an Application or revocation of a COFR does not terminate the guaranty.

        (e)  (1) A COFR Operator may ask the Director to reconsider a denial of the COFR Operator's Application or the revocation of a COFR as follows:

        (i) The COFR Operator must submit the request for reconsideration, in writing, to the Director no later than 21 days after the date of the denial or revocation.

        (ii) The submission must state the COFR Operator's reasons for requesting reconsideration and include all supporting documentation.

        (2) A decision by the Director on reconsideration of an Application denial or a COFR revocation is final agency action. If the Director does not issue a written decision on the request for reconsideration within 30 days after its submission, the request for reconsideration will be deemed to have been denied, and the Application denial or COFR revocation will be deemed to have been affirmed as a matter of final agency action. Unless the Director issues a decision reversing the revocation, the COFR revocation remains in effect.

        (f)  If the COFR for a vessel expires or is revoked while the vessel is located in the navigable waters, at any port or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or in the Exclusive Economic Zone, the COFR Operator and the vessel's other responsible parties will be deemed in violation of this subpart. In such event, the COFR Operator or, if unavailable or no longer operating the vessel, the vessel's current responsible parties, must notify the Director within 24 hours, by email or other electronic means. The notice must include the information required by § 138.150(b) and must establish new evidence of financial responsibility, designate a new COFR Operator if applicable, and cure any other violation of this subpart.

        § 138.150   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 138.150

        (a)  When there is a change in any of the facts contained in an Application, a request for COFR renewal, evidence of financial responsibility, or other submission made under this subpart, the change must be reported, in writing, to the Director. The reports required by this section may be submitted with, but are in addition to, other submissions required by this subpart (for example, Applications, requests for COFR renewal, semi-annual and annual financial reports, Master Certificate reports).

        (d)  Each guarantor (or, if there are multiple guarantors, each lead guarantor) must give the Director 30 days notice before terminating a guaranty as provided in § 138.110(a)(3), explaining the reason for the intended termination, once known, or should have known, in the ordinary course of business.

        (e)  A failure to timely submit the reports required by this section may result in enforcement actions as provided in § 138.170. Exceptions to the reporting deadlines will only be granted as provided in § 138.60(e).

        § 138.160   Non-owning COFR Operator's responsibility for identification.

#### § § 138.160

        (a) Each COFR Operator of a vessel with a COFR, other than an unmanned, non-self-propelled barge, who is not also an owner of the vessel must ensure that the original or a legible copy of the vessel's demise charter-party (or other written document on the owner's letterhead, signed by the vessel owner, which specifically identifies the COFR Operator named on the COFR) is maintained on board the vessel.

        (b) The demise charter-party or other document required by paragraph (a) of this section must be presented, upon request, for examination and copying, to the Director or other United States Government official.

        § 138.170   Enforcement.

#### § § 138.170

        (a)  Any person who fails to comply with the requirements of this subpart, including the reporting requirements in § 138.150, may be subject to enforcement as provided in this section, including if—

        (3) The COFR Operator ceases, for any reason, to be an operator of a covered vessel, including when a vessel is scrapped or transferred to a new owner or operator, and a new Application and report have not been submitted to the Director as required by §§ 138.80 and 138.150; or

        (4) The COFR Operator fails to maintain a U.S. agent for service of process.

        (b)  During a period of non-compliance with this subpart, all use by the vessel of the navigable waters of the United States, of any port or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or of the Exclusive Economic Zone to transship or lighter oil destined for a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, is forbidden.

        (c)  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will withhold or revoke the clearance required by 46 U.S.C. 60105 of any vessel subject to this subpart that does not have a COFR or for which the evidence of financial responsibility required has not been established and maintained.

        § 138.240   Procedure for updating limits of liability to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index (Annual CPI-U) and statutory changes.

#### § § 138.240

        (a)  The Director, NPFC, will periodically adjust the limits of liability set forth in § 138.230(a) through (c) to reflect significant increases in the Annual CPI-U, according to the procedure for calculating limit of liability inflation adjustments set forth in paragraphs (b)-(d) of this section, and will publish the inflation-adjusted limits of liability and any statutory amendments to those limits of liability in the  as amendments to § 138.230. Updates to the limits of liability under this paragraph are effective on the 90th day after publication in the  of the amendments to § 138.230, unless otherwise specified by statute (in the event of a statutory amendment to the limits of liability) or in the  notice amending § 138.230.

        (b)  (1) The Director, NPFC, calculates the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit of liability was established, or last adjusted by statute or regulation, whichever is later ( the previous period), to the most recently published Annual CPI-U ( the current period), using the following escalation formula:

        (2) The cumulative percent change value calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is rounded to one decimal place.

        (c)  Not later than every three years from the year the limits of liability were last adjusted for inflation, the Director, NPFC, will evaluate whether the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since that date has reached a significance threshold of 3 percent or greater. For any three-year period in which the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U is less than 3 percent, the Director, NPFC, will publish a notice of no inflation adjustment to the limits of liability in the  If this occurs, the Director, NPFC, will recalculate the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since the year in which the limits of liability were last adjusted for inflation each year thereafter until the cumulative percent change equals or exceeds the threshold amount of 3 percent. Once the 3-percent threshold is reached, the Director, NPFC, will increase the limits of liability, by regulation using the procedure set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, for all source categories (including any new limit of liability established by statute or regulation since the last time the limits of liability were adjusted for inflation) by an amount equal to the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year each limit was established, or last adjusted by statute or regulation, whichever is later. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Director, NPFC, in the Director's sole discretion, from adjusting the limits of liability for inflation by regulation issued more frequently than every three years.

        (d)  The Director, NPFC, calculates adjustments to the limits of liability in § 138.230 for inflation using the following formula:

Rulemakings will afford prior public notice and comment, except when there is good cause not to do so, for example due to an imminent threat to the safety of life and property.

        (b) Before a safety zone, no anchoring area (NAA), or area to be avoided (ATBA) is established, all factors detrimental to safety are considered, including but not limited to:

        (1) The scope and degree of the risk or hazard involved;

        (2) Vessel traffic characteristics and trends, including traffic volume, the sizes and types of vessels involved, potential interference with the flow of commercial traffic, the presence of any unusual cargoes, and other similar factors;

        (3) Port and waterway configurations and variations in local conditions of geography, climate and other similar factors;

        (4) The need for granting exemptions for the installation and use of equipment or devices for use with vessel traffic services for certain classes of small vessels, such as self-propelled fishing vessels and recreational vessels;

        (5) The proximity of fishing grounds, oil and gas drilling and production operations, or other potential or actual conflicting activity;

        (6) Environmental factors;

        (7) Economic impact and effects;

        (8) Existing vessel traffic services; and

          § 151.26   Shipboard oil pollution emergency plans.

#### § § 151.26

          (a)  The shipboard oil pollution emergency plan must be available on board in English and in the working language of the master and the officers of the ship, if other than English.

          (b)  The plan must contain the following six sections. A seventh non-mandatory section may be included at the shipowner's discretion:

          (1)  This section must contain the following:

          (i)  The introductory text of the plan must contain the following language (For ships operating in Antarctica, the introductory text of the plan must contain the following language  explain that they are in accordance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty):

          (ii) General information.

          (A) The ship's name, call sign, official number, International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number, and principal characteristics.

          (B) [Reserved]

          (2)  The plan must be realistic, practical, and easy to use, and the Preamble section of the plan must reflect these three features of the plan. The use of flowcharts, checklists, and appendices within the plan will aid in addressing this requirement. This section must contain an explanation of the purpose and use of the plan and indicate how the shipboard plan relates to other shore-based plans. Additionally, the Preamble section of the plan must clearly recognize coastal States' rights to approve oil pollution response in their waters by stating the following:

          (3)  This section of the plan must include information relating to the following:

          (i)  A report shall be made whenever an incident involves—

          (A) A discharge of oil above the permitted level for any reason, including those for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea;

          (B) A discharge of oil or oily mixture during the operation of the ship in excess of the quantities or instantaneous rate permitted in § 151.10 of this subpart or in § 157.37 of this subchapter; or

          (C) A probable discharge. Factors to be considered in determining whether a discharge is probable include, but are not limited to: ship location and proximity to land or other navigational hazards, weather, tide, current, sea state, and traffic density. The master must make a report in cases of collision, grounding, fire, explosion, structural failure, flooding or cargo shifting, or an incident resulting in failure or breakdown of steering gear, propulsion, electrical generating system, or essential shipborne navigational aids.

          (ii)  This section of the plan must include a notification form, such as the one depicted in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii), that includes all the data elements required in Resolution A.851(20) and contains information to be provided in the initial and follow-up notifications. The official number of the vessel and current conditions of the vessel are to be included. In addition, the initial notification should include as much of the information on the form as possible, and supplemental information, as appropriate. However, the initial notification must not be delayed pending collection of all information. Copies of the form must be placed at the location(s) on the ship from which notification may be made.

          (iii)  (A) This section of the plan must make reference to the appendices listing coastal state contacts, port contacts, and ship interest contacts. In order to expedite response and minimize damage from a pollution incident, it is essential that appropriate coastal States should be notified without delay. This process begins with the initial report required by article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78.

          (B) For actual or probable discharges of oil, or oily mixtures the reports must comply with the procedures described in MARPOL Protocol I. The reports shall be directed to either the nearest Captain of the Port (COTP) or to the National Response Center (NRC),  800-424-8802,  202-267-2675, or  202-267-1322.

          (C) For Antarctica, in addition to compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, reports shall also be directed to any Antarctic station that may be affected.

          (D) The plan must clearly specify who will be responsible for informing the necessary parties from the coastal State contacts, the port contacts, and the ship interest contacts.

          (4)  This section of the plan must contain a discussion of procedures to address the following scenarios:

          (i) Operational spills: The plan must outline procedures for safe removal of oil spilled and contained on deck. The plan must also provide guidance to ensure proper disposal of recovered oil and cleanup materials;

          (ii) Spills resulting from casualties: Casualties should be treated in the plan as a separate section. The plan should include various checklists or other means that will ensure the master considers all appropriate factors when addressing the specific casualty (Reference is made here to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, Section 8). These checklists must be tailored to the specific ship and to the specific product or product types. In addition to the checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks must be identified. Reference to existing fire control plans and muster lists is sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities. The following are examples of casualties that must be considered—

          (A) Grounding;

          (B) Fire or explosion;

          (C) Collision/Allision;

          (D) Hull failure;

          (E) Excessive list;

          (F) Containment system failure;

          (G) Submerged/Foundered;

          (H) Wrecked/Stranded; and

          (I) Hazardous vapor release.

          (iii) In addition to the checklist and personnel duty assignments required by paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the plan must include—

          (A) Priority actions to ensure the safety of personnel and the ship, assess the damage to the ship, and take appropriate further action;

          (B) Stability and strength considerations: The plan should provide the master with detailed guidance to ensure that great care in casualty response must be taken to consider stability and strength when taking actions to mitigate the spillage of oil or to free the vessel if aground. Information for making damage stability and longitudinal strength assessments, or contacting classification societies to acquire such information, should be included. Where appropriate, the plan should provide a list of information for making damage stability and damage longitudinal strength assessments. The damage stability information for oil tankers and offshore oil barges in 33 CFR 155.240 is required to be provided in the SOPEP;

          (C) Lightening procedures to be followed in cases of extensive structural damage: The plan must contain information on procedures to be followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in the plan to existing company guides. A copy of such company procedures for ship-to-ship transfer operations must be kept in the plan. The plan must address the coordination of this activity with the coastal or port state, as appropriate;

          (D) Mitigating activities: The spill mitigation requirements of 33 CFR 155.1035(c) must be met for tankships, the requirements of 33 CFR 155.1040(c) must be met for unmanned vessels, and the requirements of 33 CFR 155.5035(c) must be met for nontank vessels. Additionally, the following personnel safety mitigation strategies must be addressed for all personnel involved—

          (1) Assessment and monitoring activities;

          (2) Personnel protection issues;

          (3) Protective equipment;

          (4) Threats to health and safety;

          (5) Containment and other response techniques;

          (6) Isolation procedures;

          (7) Decontamination of personnel; and

          (8) Disposal of removed oil and clean-up materials; and

          (E) Drawings and ship-specific details: Supporting plans, drawings, and ship-specific details such as a layout of a general arrangement plan, midship section, lines or tables of offsets, and tank tables must be included with the plan. The plan must show where current cargo, bunker or ballast information, including quantities and specifications, is available.

          (5)  (i) This section of the plan must contain information to assist the master in initiating action by the coastal State, local government, or other involved parties. This information must include guidance to assist the master with organizing a response to the incident, should a response not be organized by the shore authorities. Detailed information for specific areas may be included as appendices to the plan. See 33 CFR 151.26(b)(2) (Preamble) regarding a ship owner's responsibility to comply with individual state requirements for oil spill response.

          (ii) For Antarctica, a vessel owner or operator must include a plan for prompt and effective response action to such emergencies as might arise in the performance of its vessel's activities.

          (iii) To comply with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, an agency of the United States government may promulgate a directive providing for prompt and effective response by the agency's public vessels operating in Antarctica.

          (6)  Appendices must include the following information:

          (i) Twenty-four hour contact information and alternates to the designated contacts. These details must be routinely updated to account for personnel changes and changes in telephone, telex, and telefacsimile numbers. Clear guidance must also be provided regarding the preferred means of communication.

          (ii) The following lists, each identified as a separate appendix:

          (A) A list of agencies or officials of coastal state administrations responsible for receiving and processing incident reports;

          (B) A list of agencies or officials in regularly visited ports. When this is not feasible, the master must obtain details concerning local reporting procedures upon arrival in port; and

          (C) A list of all parties with a financial interest in the ship such as ship and cargo owners, insurers, and salvage interests.

          (D) A list which specifies who will be responsible for informing the parties listed and the priority in which they must be notified.

          (iii) A record of annual reviews and changes.

          (7)  If this section is included by the shipowner, it should include the following types of information or any other information that may be appropriate:

          (i) Response equipment or oil spill removal organizations;

          (ii) Public affairs practices;

          (iii) Recordkeeping;

          (iv) Plan exercising; and

          (v) Individuals qualified to respond.

          (8)  The plan must be organized as depicted in Table 151.26(b)(8).

        § 151.1510   Ballast water management requirements.

#### § § 151.1510

        (a) The master of each vessel subject to this subpart shall employ one of the following ballast water management practices:

        (1) Carry out an exchange of ballast water on the waters beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), from an area more than 200 nautical miles from any shore, and in waters more than 2,000 meters (6,560 feet, 1,093 fathoms) deep, such that, at the conclusion of the exchange, any tank from which ballast water will be discharged contains water with a minimum salinity level of 30 parts per thousand, unless the vessel is required to employ an approved ballast water management system (BWMS) per the schedule in § 151.1512(b) of this subpart. This exchange must occur prior to entry into the Snell Lock at Massena, NY, or navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge. An alternative management system (AMS) that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 151.2026 may also be used, so long as it was installed on the vessel prior to the date that the vessel is required to comply with the ballast water discharge standard in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart. If using an AMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart may employ the AMS for no longer than 5 years from the date they would otherwise be required to comply with the ballast water discharge standard in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart.

        (2) Retain the vessel's ballast water on board the vessel. If this method of ballast water management is employed, the COTP may seal any tank or hold containing ballast water on board the vessel for the duration of the voyage within the waters of the Great Lakes or the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge.

        (3) Install and operate a BWMS that has been approved by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR part 162, in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart. Following installation of a BWMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel must maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specifications.

        (i) Requirements for approval of BWMS are found in 46 CFR part 162.060.

        (ii) Requests for approval of BWMS must be submitted to the Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, or by email to

        (4) Use only water from a U.S. public water system (PWS), as defined in 40 CFR 141.2 and that meets the requirements of 40 CFR parts 141 and 143, as ballast water. Vessels using water from a PWS as ballast must maintain a record of which PWS they received the water and a receipt, invoice, or other documentation from the PWS indicating that water came from that system. Furthermore, they must certify that they have met the conditions in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. Vessels using water from a PWS must use such water exclusively for all ballast water unless the usage is in accordance with § 151.1515 of this subpart. Vessels using PWS water as ballast must have either—

        (i) Previously cleaned the ballast tanks (including removing all residual sediments) and not subsequently introduced ambient water; or

        (ii) Never introduced ambient water to those tanks and supply lines.

        (b) No master of a vessel subject to this subpart shall separately discharge sediment from tanks or holds containing ballast water unless it is disposed of ashore in accordance with local requirements.

        (c) Nothing in this subpart authorizes the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances (NLSs) in a manner prohibited by United States or international laws or regulations. Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, NLSs, or any other pollutant must be discharged in accordance with the applicable regulations. Nothing in this subpart affects or supersedes any requirement or prohibitions pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 ).

        (d) Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this subpart, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of vessels employing a Coast Guard-approved BWMS must meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard, found in § 151.1511 of this subpart, at all times of ballast water discharge into the waters of the United States.

        (2) For organisms less than 50 micrometers and greater than or equal to 10 micrometers: discharge must include fewer than 10 living organisms per milliliter (mL) of ballast water.

        (3) Indicator microorganisms must not exceed:

        (i) For Toxicogenic  (serotypes O1 and O139): a concentration of less than 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 mL.

        (ii) For  a concentration of fewer than 250 cfu per 100 mL.

        (iii) For intestinal enterococci: a concentration of fewer than 100 cfu per 100 mL.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) The Coast Guard will conduct a practicability review as follows:

        (1) No later than January 1, 2016, the Coast Guard will publish the results of a practicability review to determine—

        (i) Whether technology to comply with a performance st_and_ard more stringent than that required by paragraph (a) of this section can be practicably implemented, in whole or in part, and, if so, the Coast Guard will schedule a rulemaking to implement the more stringent standard;

        (ii) Whether testing protocols that can accurately measure efficacy of treatment against a performance standard more stringent than that required by paragraph (a) of this section can be practicably implemented.

        (2) If the Coast Guard determines on the basis of a practicability review conducted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that technology to achieve a significant improvement in ballast water treatment efficacy could be practicably implemented, the Coast Guard will report this finding and will, no later than January 1, 2017, initiate a rulemaking that would establish performance standards and other requirements or conditions to ensure to the maximum extent practicable that aquatic nuisance species are not discharged into waters of the United States from vessels. If the Coast Guard subsequently finds that it is not able to meet this schedule, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the  so informing the public, along with an explanation of the reason for the delay, and a revised schedule for rule making that shall be as expeditious as practicable.

        (3) When conducting the practicability review as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Coast Guard will consider—

        (i) The capability of any identified technology to achieve a more stringent ballast water discharge standard, in whole or in part;

        (ii) The effectiveness of any identified technology in the shipboard environment;

        (iii) The compatibility of any identified technology with vessel design and operation;

        (iv) The safety of any identified technology;

        (v) Whether the use of any identified technology may have an adverse impact on the environment;

        (vi) The cost of any identified technology;

        (vii) The economic impact of any identified technology, including the impact on shipping, small businesses, and other uses of the aquatic environment;

        (viii) The availability, accuracy, precision, and cost of methods and technologies for measuring the concentrations of organisms, treatment chemicals, or other pertinent parameters in treated ballast water as would be required under any alternative discharge standards;

        (ix) Any requirements for the management of ballast water included in the most current version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Vessel General Permit and any documentation available from the EPA regarding the basis for these requirements; and

        (x) Any other factor that the Coast Guard considers appropriate that is related to the determination of whether identified technology is performable, practicable, and/or may possibly prevent the introduction and spread of non-indigenous aquatic invasive species.

        § 151.2025   Ballast water management requirements.

#### § § 151.2025

        (a) The master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel equipped with ballast tanks that operates in the waters of the United States must employ one of the following ballast water management methods:

        (1) Install and operate a ballast water management system (BWMS) that has been approved by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR part 162. The BWMS must be installed in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. Following installation, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart must properly maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specifications. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this subpart, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of vessels employing a Coast Guard-approved BWMS must meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard (BWDS), found in § 151.2030 of this subpart, at all times of discharge into the waters of the United States.

        (2) Use only water from a U.S. public water system (PWS), as defined in 40 CFR 141.2, that meets the requirements of 40 CFR parts 141 and 143 as ballast water. Vessels using water from a PWS as ballast must maintain a record of which PWS they received the water from as well as a receipt, invoice, or other documentation from the PWS indicating that water came from that system. Furthermore, they must certify that they have met the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, and describe in the BWM plan the procedures to be used to ensure compliance with those conditions, and thereafter document such compliance in the BW record book. Vessels using water from a PWS must use such water exclusively unless the usage is in accordance with § 151.2040 of this subpart. Vessels using PWS water as ballast must have either—

        (i) Previously cleaned the ballast tanks (including removing all residual sediments) and not subsequently introduced ambient water; or

        (ii) Never introduced ambient water to those tanks and supply lines.

        (3) Perform complete ballast water exchange in an area 200 nautical miles from any shore prior to discharging ballast water, unless the vessel is required to employ an approved BWMS per the schedule found in § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. An alternate management system (AMS) that meets the requirements of § 151.2026 of this subpart may also be used, so long as it was installed on the vessel prior to the date that the vessel is required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. If using an AMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart may employ the AMS for no longer than 5 years from the date they would otherwise be required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart;

        (4) Do not discharge ballast water into waters of the United States.

        (5) Discharge to a facility onshore or to another vessel for purposes of treatment. Any vessel owner/operator discharging ballast water to a facility onshore or to another vessel must ensure that all vessel piping and supporting infrastructure up to the last manifold or valve immediately before the dock manifold connection of the receiving facility or similar appurtenance on a reception vessel prevents untreated ballast water from being discharged into waters of the United States.

        (b) Requests for approval of BWMS must be submitted to the Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, or by email to  in accordance with 46 CFR part 162.

        (c) A vessel engaged in the foreign export of Alaskan North Slope Crude Oil must comply with §§ 151.2060 and 151.2070 of this subpart, as well as with the provisions of 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii). Section 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii) requires a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange unless doing so would endanger the safety of the vessel or crew.

        (d) This subpart does not authorize the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances (NLS) in a manner prohibited by United States or international laws or regulations. Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, NLS, or any other pollutant must be discharged in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

        (e) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 to 1376).

        (f) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 ).

        (g) Vessels with installed BWMS for testing and evaluation by an Independent Laboratory in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 162.060-10 and 46 CFR 162.060-28 will be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (ii) For  a concentration of fewer than 250 cfu per 100 mL.

        (iii) For intestinal enterococci: A concentration of fewer than 100 cfu per 100 mL.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c) The Coast Guard will conduct a practicability review as follows:

        (1) No later than January 1, 2016, the Coast Guard will publish the results of a practicability review to determine—

        (i) Whether technology to comply with a performance standard more stringent than that required by paragraph (a) of this section can be practicably implemented, in whole or in part, and, if so, the Coast Guard will schedule a rulemaking to implement the more stringent standard; and

        (ii) Whether testing protocols that can assure accurate measurement of compliance with a performance standard more stringent than that required by paragraph (a) of this section can be practicably implemented.

        (2) If the Coast Guard determines on the basis of a practicability review conducted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that technology to achieve a significant improvement in ballast water treatment efficacy could be practicably implemented, the Coast Guard will report this finding and will, no later than January 1, 2017, initiate a rulemaking that would establish performance standards and other requirements or conditions to ensure to the maximum extent practicable that aquatic nuisance species are not discharged into waters of the United States from vessels. If the Coast Guard subsequently finds that it is not able to meet this schedule, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the  so informing the public, along with an explanation of the reason for the delay, and a revised schedule for rule making that shall be as expeditious as practicable.

        (3) When conducting the practicability review as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Coast Guard will consider—

        § 151.2040   Discharge of ballast water in extraordinary circumstances.

#### § § 151.2040

        (a) The Coast Guard will allow the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel that cannot practicably meet the requirements of § 151.2025(a) of this subpart, either because its voyage does not take it into waters 200 nautical miles or greater from any shore for a sufficient length of time and the vessel retains ballast water onboard or because the master of the vessel has identified safety or stability concerns, to discharge ballast water in areas other than the Great Lakes and the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge.

        (1) The Coast Guard will not allow such a discharge if the vessel is required to have a Coast Guard-approved ballast water management system (BWMS) per the implementation schedule found in § 151.2035(b) of this subpart.

        (2) If the Coast Guard allows the discharge of ballast water as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel must discharge only that amount of ballast water operationally necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel for cargo operations.

        (3) Ballast water records must be made available to the local Captain of the Port (COTP) upon request.

        (4) Vessels on a voyage to the Great Lakes or the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge must comply with the requirements of 33 CFR 151.1515.

        (b) If the installed BWMS required by this subpart stops operating properly during a voyage, or the vessel's BWM method is unexpectedly unavailable, the person directing the movement of the vessel must ensure that the problem is reported to the nearest COTP or District Commander as soon as practicable. The vessel may continue to the next port of call, subject to the directions of the COTP or District Commander, as provided by part 160 of this chapter.

        (1) The Coast Guard will normally allow a vessel that cannot practicably meet the requirements of § 151.2025(a)(1) of this subpart because its installed BWMS is inoperable, or the vessel's BWM method is unexpectedly unavailable, to employ one of the other ballast water management (BWM) methods listed in § 151.2025(a) of this subpart.

        (2) If the master of the vessel determines that the vessel cannot employ other BWM methods due to the voyage or safety concerns listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Coast Guard will normally allow the vessel to discharge ballast water in areas other than the Great Lakes and the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge.

        (3) If the Coast Guard approves such an allowance, the vessel must discharge only that amount of ballast water operationally necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the vessel for cargo operations. Ballast water records must be made available to the local COTP upon request.

        (c) Nothing in this subpart relieves the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel of any responsibility, including ensuring the safety and stability of the vessel and the safety of the crew and passengers.

        § 151.2050   Additional requirements—nonindigenous species reduction practices.

#### § § 151.2050

        (3) Areas near dredging operations.

        (4) Areas where tidal flushing is known to be poor or times when a tidal stream is known to be turbid.

        (5) In darkness, when bottom-dwelling organisms may rise up in the water column.

        (6) Where propellers may stir up the sediment.

        (7) Areas with pods of whales, convergence zones, and boundaries of major currents.

        (c) Clean the ballast tanks regularly to remove sediments. Sediments must be disposed of in accordance with local, State, and Federal regulations.

        (d) Discharge only the minimal amount of ballast water essential for vessel operations while in the waters of the United States.

        (e) Rinse anchors and anchor chains when the anchor is retrieved to remove organisms and sediments at their places of origin.

        (f) Remove fouling organisms from the vessel's hull, piping, and tanks on a regular basis and dispose of any removed substances in accordance with local, State and Federal regulations.

        (g) Maintain a ballast water management (BWM) plan that has been developed specifically for the vessel and that will allow those responsible for the plan's implementation to understand and follow the vessel's BWM strategy and comply with the requirements of this subpart.

        (1) The COTP will notify the facility operator in writing of any inadequacies in the Operations Manual. The facility operator may submit information, views, and arguments regarding the inadequacies identified, and proposals for amending the Manual, in print or electronically, within 45 days from the date of the COTP notice. After considering all relevant material presented, the COTP will notify the facility operator of any amendment required or adopted, or the COTP will rescind the notice. The amendment becomes effective 60 days after the facility operator receives the notice, unless the facility operator petitions the Commandant to review the COTP's notice, in which case its effective date is delayed pending a decision by the Commandant. Petitions to the Commandant must be submitted in writing via the COTP who issued the requirement to amend the Operations Manual.

        (2) If the COTP finds that there is a condition requiring immediate action to prevent the discharge or risk of discharge of oil or hazardous material that makes the procedure in paragraph (a)(1) of this section impractical or contrary to the public interest, the COTP may issue an amendment effective on the date the facility operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the COTP will include a brief statement of the reasons for the findings in the notice. The owner or operator may petition the Commandant to review the amendment, but the petition does not delay the amendment.

        (b) The facility operator may propose amendments to the operations manual by:

        (1) Submitting any proposed amendment and reasons for the amendment to the COTP in printed or electronic format not less than 30 days before the requested effective date of the proposed amendment; or

        (2) If an immediate amendment is needed, requesting the COTP to examine the amendment immediately.

        (c) The COTP will respond to proposed amendments submitted under paragraph (b) of this section by:

        (1) Notifying the facility operator that the amendments have been examined by the Coast Guard; or

        (2) Notifying the facility operator of any inadequacies in the operations manual or proposed amendments, with an explanation of why the manual or amendments do not meet the requirements of this subchapter.

        (d) Amendments to personnel and telephone number lists required by § 154.310(a)(7) of this part do not require examination by the COTP, but the COTP must be advised of such amendments as they occur.

        (e) Amendments may be submitted as page replacements or as an entire manual. When an entire manual is submitted, the facility operator must highlight or otherwise annotate the changes that were made since the last version examined by the Coast Guard. A revision date or other revision-specific identifying information must be included on the page replacements or amended manual.

      Subpart E [Reserved]

      Subpart F—Response Plans for Oil Facilities

**Source:** Source: CGD 91-036, 61 FR 7917, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

        § 154.1010   Purpose.

#### § § 154.1010

        This subpart establishes oil spill response plan requirements for all marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities (hereafter also referred to as facilities) that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone. The development of a response plan prepares the facility owner or operator to respond to an oil spill. These requirements specify criteria to be used during the planning process to determine the appropriate response resources. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. The criteria are based on a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident.

        § 154.1015   Applicability.

#### § § 154.1015

        (a) This subpart applies to all MTR facilities that because of their location could reasonably be expected to cause at least substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone.

        (b) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport oil, in bulk, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines and are classified as substantial harm MTR facilities:

        (1) Fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of transferring oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more and deepwater ports;

        (2) Mobile MTR facilities used or intended to be used to transfer oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more; and

        (3) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as substantial harm facilities by the COTP under § 154.1016.

        (c) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport oil in bulk could not only reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm, but also significant and substantial harm, to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone and are classified as significant and substantial harm MTR facilities:

        (1) Deepwater ports, and fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of transferring oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more except for facilities that are part of a non-transportation-related fixed onshore facility with a storage capacity of less than 42,000 gallons; and

        (2) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as significant and substantial harm facilities by the COTP under § 154.1016.

        (d) An MTR facility owner or operator who believes the facility is improperly classified may request review and reclassification in accordance with § 154.1075.

        § 154.1016   Facility classification by COTP.

#### § § 154.1016

        (a) The COTP may upgrade the classification of:

        (1) An MTR facility not specified in § 154.1015 (b) or (c) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment; or

        (2) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(b) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment.

        (b) The COTP may downgrade, the classification of:

        (1) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(c) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment; or

        (2) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(b) to a facility that could not reasonably be expected to cause substantial, or significant and substantial harm to the environment.

        (3) The COTP will consider downgrading an MTR facility's classification only upon receiving a written request for a downgrade of classification from the facility's owner or operator.

        (c) When changing a facility classification the COTP may, as appropriate, consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to: Type and quantity of oils handled in bulk; facility spill history; age of facility; proximity to public and commercial water supply intakes; proximity to navigable waters based on the definition of navigable waters in 33 CFR 2.36; and proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.

In addition, there must be adequate sorbent material for initial response to an average most probable discharge. If the facility is a fixed facility, the containment boom and sorbent material must be located at the facility. If the facility is a mobile facility, the containment boom and sorbent must be available locally and be at the site of the discharge within 1 hour of its discovery.

        § 154.1041   Specific response information to be maintained on mobile MTR facilities.

#### § § 154.1041

        (a) Each mobile MTR facility must carry the following information as contained in the response plan when performing transfer operations:

        (1) A description of response activities for a discharge which may occur during transfer operations. This may be a narrative description or a list of procedures to be followed in the event of a discharge.

        (2) Identity of response resources to respond to a discharge from the mobile MTR facility.

        (3) List of the appropriate persons and agencies (including the telephone numbers) to be contacted in regard to a discharge and its handling, including the National Response Center.

        (b) The owner or operator of the mobile facility must also retain the information in this paragraph at the principal place of business.

        § 154.1045   Response plan development and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport Group I through Group IV petroleum oils.

#### § § 154.1045

        (a) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils shall use the criteria in this section to evaluate response resources identified in the response plan for the specified operating environment.

        (1) The criteria in Table 1 of appendix C of this part are to be used solely for identification of appropriate equipment in a response plan. These criteria reflect conditions used for planning purposes to select mechanical response equipment and are not conditions that would limit response actions or affect normal facility operations.

        (2) The response resources must be evaluated considering limitations for the COTP zones in which the facility operates, including but not limited to—

        (i) Ice conditions;

        (ii) Debris;

        (iii) Temperature ranges;

        (iv) Weather-related visibility; and

        (v) Other appropriate environmental conditions as determined by the COTP.

        (3) The COTP may reclassify a specific body of water or location within the COTP zone. Any reclassifications will be identified by the COTP in the applicable ACP. Reclassifications may be to—

        (i) A more stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions exceed the significant wave height criteria during more than 35 percent of the year; or

        (ii) A less stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions do not exceed the significant wave height criteria for the less stringent operating environment during more than 35 percent of the year.

        (b) Response equipment must—

        (1) Meet or exceed the operating criteria listed in Table 1 of appendix C of this part;

        (2) Function in the applicable operating environment; and

        (3) Be appropriate for the petroleum oil carried.

        (c) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the facility's average most probable discharge. The response resources must include, at a minimum—

        (1) 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts petroleum oil transfers to or from the facility, whichever is greater, and the means of deploying and anchoring the boom available at the spill site within 1 hour of the detection of a spill; and

        (2) Oil recovery devices and recovered oil storage capacity capable of being at the spill site within 2 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

        (d) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to a discharge up to the facility's maximum most probable discharge volume.

        (1) The response resources must include sufficient containment boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity for any recovery of up to the maximum most probable discharge planning volume, as contained in appendix C.

        (2) The response resources must be appropriate for each group of petroleum oil identified in § 154.1020 that is handled, stored, or transported by the facility.

        (3) These response resources must be positioned such that they can arrive at the scene of a discharge within the following specified times:

        (i) The equipment identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section or in § 154.1040(d) must arrive within the times specified in those paragraphs or that section, as appropriate.

        (ii) In higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes, response resources must be capable of arriving on scene within 6 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

        (iii) In all other locations, response resources must be capable of arriving on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil discharge from a facility.

        (4) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).

        (e) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify the response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the worst case discharge volume of petroleum oil to the maximum extent practicable.

        (1) The location of these response resources must be suitable to meet the response times identified in paragraph (f) of this section for the applicable geographic area(s) of operation and response tier.

        (2) The response resources must be appropriate for—

        (i) The volume of the facility's worst case discharge;

        (ii) Group(s) of petroleum oil as identified in § 154.1020 that are handled, stored, or transported by the facility; and

        (iii) The geographic area(s) in which the facility operates.

        (3) The response resources must include sufficient boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity to recover the worst case discharge planning volumes.

        (4) The guidelines in appendix C of this part must be used for calculating the quantity of response resources required to respond at each tier to the worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.

        (5) When determining response resources necessary to meet the requirements of this section, a portion of those resources must be capable of use in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of the response equipment identified for the applicable geographic area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth.

        (i) Offshore—10 percent.

        (ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals—20 percent.

        (6) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may be permitted to operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).

        (f) Response equipment identified in a response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must be capable of arriving on scene within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable response tier in a higher volume port area, Great Lakes, and in other areas. Response times for these tiers from the time of discovery of a discharge are—

        (g) For the purposes of arranging for response resources for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), response equipment identified for Tier 1 plan credit must be capable of being mobilized and en route to the scene of a discharge within 2 hours of notification. The notification procedures identified in the plan must provide for notification and authorization of mobilization of identified Tier 1 response resources—

        (1) Either directly or through the qualified individual; and

        (2) Within 30 minutes of a discovery of a discharge or substantial threat of discharge.

        (h) Response resources identified for Tier 2 and Tier 3 plan credit must be capable of arriving on scene within the time specified for the applicable tier.

        (i) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports groups II through IV petroleum oils within the inland, nearshore, or offshore areas where pre-authorization for dispersant use exists must identify in their response plan, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, response resources capable of conducting dispersant operations within those areas.

        (1) Dispersant response resources must be capable of commencing dispersant-application operations at the site of a discharge within 7 hours of the decision by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator to use dispersants.

        (2) Dispersant response resources must include all of the following:

        (i) Sufficient volumes of dispersants for application as required by paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Any dispersants identified in a response plan must be of a type listed on the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan Product Schedule (which is contained in 40 CFR part 300, and available online from the U.S. Government Printing Office).

        (ii) Dispersant-application platforms capable of delivering and applying the dispersant on a discharge in the amounts as required by paragraph (i)(3) of this section. At least 50 percent of each EDAC tier requirement must be achieved through the use of fixed-wing, aircraft-based application platforms. For dispersant-application platforms not detailed within the EDSP, adequacy of performance criteria must be documented by presentation of independent evaluation materials (e.g., field tests and reports of actual use) that record the performance of the platform.

        (iii) Dispersant-application systems that are consistent in design with, and are capable of applying dispersants within, the performance criteria in ASTM F1413-07 (incorporated by reference,  § 154.106). For dispersant-application systems not fully covered by ASTM F1413-07, such as fire monitor-type applicators, adequacy of performance criteria must be documented by presentation of independent evaluation materials (e.g., laboratory tests, field tests, and reports of actual use) that record the design of performance specifications.

        (iv) Dispersant-application personnel trained in and capable of applying dispersants according to the recommended procedures contained within ASTM F1737-07 (incorporated by reference,  § 154.106).

        (3) Dispersant stockpiles, application platforms, and other supporting resources must be available in a quantity and type sufficient to treat a facility's worst-case discharge (as determined by using the criteria in appendix C, section 8) or in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements in Table 154.1045(i) of this section, whichever is the lesser amount.

        (j) The owner or operator of a facility handling Groups I through IV petroleum oil as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan, and ensure the availability through contract or other approved means, of response resources necessary to provide aerial oil tracking to support oil spill assessment and cleanup activities. Facilities operating exclusively on inland rivers are not required to comply with this paragraph. Aerial oil tracking resources must:

        (1) Be capable of arriving at the site of a discharge in advance of the arrival of response resources identified in the plan for tiers 1, 2, and 3 Worst-Case Discharge response times, and for a distance up to 50 nautical miles from shore (excluding inland rivers);

        (2) Be capable of supporting oil spill removal operations continuously for three 10-hour operational periods during the initial 72 hours of the discharge;

        (3) Include appropriately located aircraft and personnel capable of meeting the response time requirement for oil tracking from paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and

        (4) Include sufficient numbers of aircraft, pilots, and trained observation personnel to support oil spill removal operations, commencing upon initial assessment, and capable of coordinating on-scene cleanup operations, including dispersant and mechanical recovery operations. Observation personnel must be trained in:

        (i) The protocols of oil-spill reporting and assessment, including estimation of slick size, thickness, and quantity; and

        (ii) The use of assessment techniques in ASTM F1779-08 (incorporated by reference,  § 154.106), and familiar with the use of other guides, such as NOAA's “Open Water Oil Identification Job Aid for Aerial Observation,” and NOAA's “Characteristic Coastal Habitats” guide (available on the Internet at use the following links in the order presented: Home|Emergency Response|Responding to Oil Spills).

        (k) A response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify response resources with firefighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that does not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or that can not rely on sufficient local firefighting resources must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), the availability of adequate firefighting resources. The response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for petroleum oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting resources are available within a reasonable time to respond to a worst case discharge. The individual may be the qualified individual as defined in § 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.

        (l) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify equipment and required personnel available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.

        (1) Except as set out in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the identified response resources must include the quantities of boom sufficient to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments as required by § 154.1035(b)(4).

        (2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility response plan must be consistent with the required resources and response methods to be used in fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners or operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance with the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the annual plan review required under § 154.1065(a). Facility owners or operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.

        (m) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify an oil spill removal organization(s) with response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), to effect a shoreline cleanup operation commensurate with the quantity of emulsified petroleum oil to be planned for in shoreline cleanup operations.

        (1) Except as required in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the shoreline cleanup response resources required must be determined as described in appendix C of this part.

        (2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility response plan must be consistent with the required shoreline cleanup resources and methods contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners or operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance with the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the annual plan review required under § 154.1065(a). Facility owners or operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.

        (n) Appendix C of this part describes the procedures to determine the maximum extent practicable quantity of response resources that must be identified and available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), for the maximum most probable discharge volume, and for each worst case discharge response tier.

        (1) Included in appendix C of this part is a cap that recognizes the practical and technical limits of response capabilities that an individual facility owner or operator can be expected to contract for in advance.

        (2) Table 5 in appendix C of this part lists the caps that apply in February 18, 1993, and February 18, 1998. Depending on the quantity and type of petroleum oil handled by the facility and the facility's geographic area of operations, the resource capability caps in this table may be reached. The owner or operator of a facility whose estimated recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 shall identify sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower. The identified resources must be capable of arriving on scene not later than the Tier 1, 2, and 3 response times in this section. No contract is required. While general listings of available response equipment may be used to identify additional sources, a response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator has considered in his or her planning. When listing Coast Guard classified oil spill removal organization(s) which have sufficient removal capacity to recover the volume above the response capability cap for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 in appendix C of this part, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.

        (o) The Coast Guard will continue to evaluate the environmental benefits, cost efficiency and practicality of increasing mechanical recovery capability requirements. This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a public notice and comment process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include, at least, an evaluation of:

        (1) Best available technologies for containment and recovery;

        (2) Oil spill tracking technology;

        (3) High rate response techniques;

        (4) Other applicable response technologies; and

        (5) Increases in the availability of private response resources.

      Subpart I—Response Plans for Other Non-Petroleum Oil Facilities

**Source:** Source: CGD 91-036, 61 FR 7932, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

        § 154.1310   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 154.1310

        This subpart establishes oil spill response planning requirements for an owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils. The requirements of this subpart are intended for use in developing response plans and identifying response resources during the planning process. They are not performance standards.

        § 154.1320   Response plan submission requirements.

#### § § 154.1320

        An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils shall submit a response plan in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, and with all sections of subpart F of this part, except §§ 154.1045 and 154.1047, which apply to petroleum oils.

        § 154.1325   Response plan development and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport other non-petroleum oils.

#### § § 154.1325

        (a) An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils must provide information in his or her plan that identifies—

        (1) Procedures and strategies for responding to a worst case discharge of other non-petroleum oils to the maximum extent practicable; and

        (2) Sources of the equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and mitigate such a discharge.

        (b) An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils must ensure that any equipment identified in a response plan is capable of operating in the conditions expected in the geographic area(s) in which the facility operates using the criteria in Table 1 of appendix C of this part. When evaluating the operability of equipment, the facility owner or operator must consider limitations that are identified in the ACPs for the COTP zone in which the facility is located, including—

        (1) Ice conditions;

        (2) Debris;

        (3) Temperature ranges; and

        (4) Weather-related visibility.

        (c) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils must identify the response resources that are available by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a). The equipment identified in a response plan must include—

        (1) Containment boom, sorbent boom, or other methods for containing oil floating on the surface or to protect shorelines from impact;

        (2) Oil recovery devices appropriate for the type of other non-petroleum oils handled; and

        (3) Other appropriate equipment necessary to respond to a discharge involving the type of oil handled.

        (d) Response resources identified in a response plan under paragraph (c) of this section must be capable of commencing an effective on-scene response within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable operating area:

        (e) A response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils must identify response resources with firefighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that does not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on sufficient local firefighting resources must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), the availability of adequate firefighting resources. The response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department on other non-petroleum oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting resources are available within a reasonable response time to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual as defined in § 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.

        (f) The response plan for a facility that is located in any environment with year-round preapproval for use of dispersants and that handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils may request a credit for up to 25 percent of the worst case planning volume set forth by subpart F of this part. To receive this credit, the facility owner or operator must identify in the plan and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), the availability of specified resources to apply the dispersants and to monitor their effectiveness. The extent of the credit will be based on the volumes of the dispersant available to sustain operations at the manufacturers' recommended dosage rates. Identification of these resources does not imply that they will be authorized for use. Actual authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the NCP and the applicable ACP.

        Certification, Recertification, and Operational Review

          § 154.2020   Certification and recertification—owner/operator responsibilities.

#### § § 154.2020

          (a) Prior to operating, a new vapor control system (VCS) installation must be certified under 33 CFR 154.2023 by a certifying entity as meeting the requirements of this subpart.

          (b) A certified VCS or a Coast Guard-approved VCS must be recertified by a certifying entity under 33 CFR 154.2023 before it can—

          (1) Control vapors other than those for which it was originally certified;

          (2) Receive vapors from vessels other than those for which it was approved, if the VCS was in operation prior to July 23, 1990;

          (3) Operate under any changed design or configuration;

          (4) Operate as part of multi-breasted barge-loading operations, if the VCS was not originally approved or certified for such operations; or

          (5) Be connected to a tank vessel if a pigging system is used to clear cargo in the cargo line back to the tank vessel.

          (c) For a transfer facility, prior to operating a VCS to control vapor from a tank vessel during cargo loading line pigging to clear cargo in the cargo loading line back to the tank vessel, the cargo loading line pigging system must be reviewed by a certifying entity as meeting the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2104.

          (d) To apply for certification, the owner or operator of a facility VCS must submit plans, calculations, specifications, and other related information, including a qualitative failure analysis, to the certifying entity. Suggested, but not mandatory, guidance for preparing a qualitative failure analysis can be found in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication “Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures,” and in Military Standard MIL-STD-882B for a quantitative failure analysis. For assistance in locating those publications, contact the Commandant (CG-ENG), Attn: Office of Design and Engineering Standards, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, Washington, DC 20593-7509, telephone 202-372-1418 or via email at . The analysis must demonstrate that—

          (1) The VCS can operate continuously and safely while controlling cargo vapors to or from tankships or tank barges over the full range of transfer rates expected at the facility;

          (2) The VCS has the proper alarms and automatic shutdown systems required by this subpart to prevent an unsafe operation;

          (3) The VCS has sufficient automatic or passive devices to minimize damage to personnel, property, and the environment if an accident were to occur;

          (4) If a quantitative failure analysis is also conducted, the level of safety attained is at least one order of magnitude greater than that calculated for operating without a VCS; and

          (5) If a facility uses a cargo line pigging system to clear cargo in the cargo line back to the tank vessel with the VCS connected, the qualitative failure analysis must demonstrate that the cargo line pigging system has at least the same levels of safety required by paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to prevent overpressure of the vessel's cargo tanks and account for the probability that the pig is destroyed during line-pigging operations.

          (e) The VCS owner or operator must maintain at the facility—

          (1) A copy of VCS design documentation, including plans, drawings, calculations, and specifications for the VCS;

          (2) The facility operations manual, including the list of cargoes that the facility is approved to vapor control;

          (3) Any certification or recertification letter issued under 33 CFR 154.2023; and

          (4) Other records as required by 33 CFR 154.740.

          (e) Any condition requiring an alarm as specified in this part must activate an audible and visible alarm where the cargo transfer and VCSs are controlled.

          (f) For a VCS installed after August 15, 2013, an alarm or shutdown must be activated if electrical continuity of an alarm or shutdown sensor required by this subpart is lost.

          (g) The VCS piping surface temperature must not exceed 177 °C (350  °F) or 70 percent of the auto-ignition temperature in degrees Celsius of the vapors being transferred, whichever is lower, during normal operations. This must be achieved by either separating or insulating the entire VCS from external heat sources.

          (h) The VCS must be equipped with a mechanism to eliminate any liquid condensate from the vapor collection system that carries over from the vessel or condenses as a result of an enrichment process.

          (1) If a liquid knockout vessel is installed to eliminate any liquid condensate, it must have—

          (i) A mechanism to indicate the level of liquid in the device;

          (ii) A high liquid level sensor that activates an alarm, meeting the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section;

          (iii) A high-high liquid level sensor that closes the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a), and shuts down any vapor-moving devices before carrying liquid over from the vessel to the vapor-moving device. One sensor with two stages may accomplish both this requirement and the requirement of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section; and

          § 154.2103   Facility requirements for vessel vapor overpressure and vacuum protection.

#### § § 154.2103

          In this section, the requirements of having a flame arrester or a flame screen at the opening of a pressure relief valve or a vacuum relief valve apply only to facilities collecting vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.

          (a) A facility's vapor control system (VCS) must have the capacity for collecting cargo vapor at a rate of not less than the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate for cargoes that are vapor controlled plus the vapor growth for the cargoes and any inerting, diluting, or enriching gas that may be added to the system. Vapor growth must be considered as 25 percent of the cargo's saturated vapor pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) at 115  °F, divided by 12.5 psia (the vapor pressure of gasoline at 115  °F), times the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate, unless there is experimental data for actual vapor growth for turbulent transferring under the most severe conditions for vapor growth. If the cargo is transferred at temperatures above 115  °F, the cargo's true vapor pressure (in psia) at the transferring temperature must be used when determining the vapor growth.

          (b) A facility VCS must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 80 percent of the highest setting of any of the vessel's vacuum relief valves or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for a non-inerted tank vessel. A facility VCS also must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for an inerted tank vessel. The system must sustain the pressure in the vessel's cargo tanks within this range at any cargo transfer rate less than or equal to the maximum transfer rate determined at the pre-transfer conference.

          (c) The pressure measured at the facility vapor connection must be corrected for pressure drops across the vessel's vapor collection system, vapor collection hose or arm, and vapor line up to the location of the pressure sensor.

          (d) The facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device that meets the installation requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, which activates an alarm that meets 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the facility vapor connection exceeds either—

          (1) The pressure corresponding to the upper pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or

          (2) A lower pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.

          (e) If a facility draws vapor from a vessel with a vapor-moving device, the facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, which activates an alarm meeting 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the facility vapor connection falls below either—

          (1) The pressure corresponding to the lower pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or

          (i) While transferring cargo to a vessel connected to a VCS, compressed air or gas may be used to clear cargo hoses and loading arms, but must not be used to clear cargo lines. However, compressed inert gas such as nitrogen can be used to clear cargo lines if a pigging system that meets 33 CFR 154.2104 is provided.

          (j) If a pigging system is used to clear cargo lines to the tank vessel while the vessel is connected to the facility VCS, the following operational requirements apply:

          (1) The VCS must be in operation, with all of the high-pressure alarms and shutdowns required by 33 CFR 154.2103 active, before and during pigging operations;

          (2) Personnel performing the pigging operation must be adequately trained on the specific pigging system being used.

          (5) Personnel performing pigging operations must monitor pig movement at all times. The facility and vessel manifold valves must be closed immediately after the pig reaches the pig-receiving device; and

          (6) If the pigging system contains pressure-sensing, relieving, or alarming components in addition to those required by 33 CFR 154.2103, the components must be periodically tested in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (q) of this section.

          (k) If one or more analyzers required by 33 CFR 154.2107(d) or (e) or 154.2110 become inoperable during a transfer operation, the operation may continue, provided that at least one analyzer remains operational; however, no further transfer operations may start until all inoperable analyzers are replaced or repaired.

          (l) Whenever a condition results in a shutdown of the VCS, the emergency shutdown system required by 33 CFR 154.550 must be automatically activated to terminate cargo loading into tanks which are being vapor controlled.

          (m) If it is suspected that a flare in the VCS has had a flashback, or if a flame is detected on a detonation arrester required by 33 CFR 154.2109(c)(2), the transfer operation must stop and cannot restart until that detonation arrester and any quick-closing stop valves downstream of the detonation arrester are inspected and found to be in satisfactory condition.

          (n) Before each transfer operation, the freezing point of each cargo must be determined. If there is a possibility that the ambient air temperature during transfer operations will be at or below the freezing point of the cargo, adequate precautions must be taken to prevent freezing of vapor or condensate, or to detect and remove the frozen liquid and condensation to prevent accumulation.

          (o) Before each transfer operation, the cargo vapor must be evaluated to determine its potential to polymerize, and adequate precautions must be taken to prevent and detect polymerization of the cargo vapors.

          (p) Mixing of incompatible vapors is prohibited. The VCS piping, equipment, hoses, valves, and arresters must be purged between vapor control operations that involve incompatible chemical vapors in accordance with the following:

          (1) Chemical compatibility must be determined by using the procedures contained in 46 CFR part 150;

          (r) VCS equipment and instrumentation must be tested in compliance with 33 CFR 156.170(g) or (i), with the COTP or designated representative invited to observe these tests. The test procedure and a checklist must be approved by the certifying entity during the initial certification of the system and incorporated into the facility operations manual.

          (s) A transfer operation that includes collection of vapor emitted to or from a vessel's cargo tanks must meet the transfer requirements of 33 CFR 156.120(aa), and a declaration of inspection meeting the requirements of 33 CFR 156.150 must be completed before each transfer.

Three measurements must be taken against each standard and recorded as shown in Form 154.2181(b)(2) of this section, with the average of the three values in each case then used to calculate the CE according to this equation (where CE = percentage calibration error based upon span of the instrument, R = reference value of zero or high-level calibration gas introduced into the monitoring system, A = actual monitoring system response to the calibration gas, and S = span of the instrument):

          (3) The CE test must check each pressure sensor/switch for upscale (activate) and downscale (deactivate) hysteresis around the sensor/switch set pressure. The calibration error must be calculated and recorded as shown in Form 154.2181(b)(3) of this section. Test the pressure sensor/switch three times and record the desired setting and the as-found set pressure. Calculate and record the difference of the two settings. Calculate the error percentage using this equation (where CE = percentage calibration error based upon span of the instrument, R = reference setting of the instrument, A = actual response as recorded on the test instrument, and S = span of the instrument):

          (c) The calibration drift (CD) test required by 33 CFR 154.2180 must be performed once every quarter and documented as shown in Form 154.2181(c)(3) of this section, to verify the ability of the instrument to conform to the established calibration.

          (1) The CD measurement must be conducted once daily for 7 consecutive days without making any adjustments to the instruments.

          (2) Conduct the CD test at zero level (between 0 and 20 percent of the instrument span) and at high level (between 75 and 95 percent of the instrument span).

          (3) Calculate and record the CD for 7 consecutive days using the equations in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section and Form 154.2181(c)(3) of this section.

          (d) The response time (RT) test required by 33 CFR 154.2180 must be performed once every quarter and documented as shown in Form 154.2181(d) of this section, to determine the RT which is the largest average response time in the upscale or downscale direction.

          (1) For systems that normally operate below 20 percent of calibrated range, only a span (upscale) test is required.

          (2) Record the span (upscale) value, zero (downscale) cylinder gas value, and stable, initial process-measured variable value.

          (3) Determine the step change, which is equal to the average difference between the initial process-measured variable value and the average final stable cylinder gas-measured value.

          (4) To determine both upscale and downscale step change intervals—

          (i) Inject span (or zero) cylinder gas into the sample system as close to the sample probe as possible. Existing systems that inject the gas at the analyzer box do not need to be modified. However, the gas transit time between the analyzer box and the sample probe must be taken into account;

          (ii) Allow the analyzer to stabilize and record the stabilized value. A stable reading is achieved when the concentration reading deviates less than 6 percent from the measured average concentration in 6 minutes or if it deviates less than 2 percent of the monitor's span value in 1 minute;

          (iii) Stop the span (or zero) gas flow, allow the monitor to stabilize back to the measured variable value, and record the stabilized value; and

          (iv) Repeat this procedure a total of three times and subtract the average final monitor reading from the average starting monitor value to determine the average upscale (or downscale) step change.

          (5) Determine the response time, which is equal to the elapsed time at which 95 percent of the step change occurred.

          (i) To find this value, take 5 percent of the average step change value and subtract the result from the cylinder gas analyzed value as shown in the following equation:

          (ii) Inject span (or zero) cylinder gas into the sample system as close to the sample probe as possible, and measure the time it takes to reach the 95 percent step change value.

          (iii) Repeat the previous step (paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section) a total of three times each with span and zero cylinder gas to determine average upscale and downscale response times.

          (iv) Compare the response times achieved for the upscale and downscale tests. The longer of these two times equals the response time for the analyzer.

          (e) The sample system bias (SSB) test required by 33 CFR 154.2180 must be performed once every quarter and documented, to establish that the system has no additional influence on the measurement being made by the analyzer.

          (1) Conduct a close CE test in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, by injecting calibration gas as close as possible to the analyzer, eliminating as much of the sample system components as possible, while still simulating the normal source operating conditions.

          (2) If system integrity is maintained, and it has not become contaminated, the difference between the close and standard CE tests should be the same.

          (f) For CE and CD tests, analyzers and pressure sensors must meet the following minimum compliance requirements:

          (1) Oxygen analyzers must not deviate from the reference value of the zero- or high-level calibration gas by more than 0.5 percent of full scale;

          (2) Total hydrocarbon analyzers must not deviate from the reference value of the zero- or high-level calibration gas by more than 1 percent of full scale; and

          (3) Pressure sensors/switches must not deviate from the reference value of the zero- or high-level calibration gas by more than 1.5 percent of full range.

          (g) For RT tests, each oxygen or hydrocarbon analyzer must respond, in less than 1 minute, to 95 percent of the final stable value of a test span gas.

          (h) For SSB tests, the analyzer system bias must be less than 5 percent of the average difference between the standard CE test and the close CE test, divided by the individual analyzer span.

          In this section, the requirements of having a flame arrester or a flame screen at the opening of a pressure relief valve or a vacuum relief valve apply only to facilities collecting vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.

          (a) A facility vapor collection system must have a capacity for collecting cleaning facility vapors at a rate of no less than 1.1 times the facility's maximum allowable gas-freeing rate, plus any inerting, diluting, or enriching gas that may be added to the system.

          (b) A facility vapor control system (VCS) must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 80 percent of the highest setting of any of the barge's vacuum relief valves or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the barge's pressure relief valves.

          (c) A fluid displacement system must provide a pressure-sensing device that activates an alarm that satisfies the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the fluid injection connection exceeds either the pressure corresponding to the upper pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section or a lower pressure agreed upon by the facility and barge persons in charge. The pressure-sensing device must be located in the fluid displacement system's piping downstream of any devices that could potentially isolate the barge's vapor collection system from the pressure-sensing device. The pressure measured by the sensing device must be corrected for pressure drops across any barge piping, hoses, or arms that are used to inject the fluid.

          (d) A fluid displacement system must provide a pressure-sensing device that is independent of the device required by paragraph (c) of this section. This pressure-sensing device must activate the fluid displacement system emergency shutdown and close the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a). It must also close the remotely operated shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2202(c) when the pressure at the fluid injection connection reaches a corresponding 90 percent of the lowest setting of any pressure relief valve on the barge. The pressure-sensing device must be located in the fluid displacement system's piping downstream of any device that could potentially isolate the barge's VCS from the pressure-sensing device. The pressure measured by the sensing device must be corrected for pressure drops across any barge piping, hoses, or arms that are used to inject the fluid.

          (f) The vacuum relief valve requirements of paragraph (e) of this section may include a valve to isolate it from the facility vapor collection piping, provided—

          (1) The isolation valve must be interlocked with any vapor-moving device such that the vapor-moving device cannot activate unless the isolation valve is in the full open position (, the vacuum relief valve is not isolated); and

          (2) The isolation valve can only be closed after the facility person in charge has acknowledged that the hatch opening required by 33 CFR 154.2250(i) is open and secured.

          (g) If a vapor-moving device capable of drawing more than 0.5 psig vacuum is used to draw vapor, air, inert gas, or other medium from the barge, the facility must install portable, intrinsically safe, pressure-sensing devices on any cargo tank, or on the common vapor header, at the connection required by 46 CFR 39.6003(b) before any cleaning operation begins on the tank. A pressure-sensing device must be provided that—

          (1) Activates an alarm that satisfies 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure in the cargo tank being cleaned falls below 80 percent of the highest setting of any of the barge's vacuum relief valves, or a higher pressure agreed upon by the facility and barge persons in charge; and

          (2) Activates the emergency shutdown system for the vapor-moving device and closes the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve described in 33 CFR 154.2101(a) when the pressure in the cargo tank being cleaned falls below 90 percent of the highest setting of any of the barge's vacuum relief valves, or a higher pressure agreed upon by the facility and barge persons in charge. This pressure-sensing device must be independent of the device used to activate an alarm required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

          (h) The pressure-sensing devices required by paragraph (g) of this section must—

          (1) Have suitable means, such as approved intrinsic safety barriers that are able to accept passive devices, so that the under-pressure alarm circuits of the barge side of the under-pressure control system, including cabling, normally closed switches, and pin and sleeve connectors, are intrinsically safe;

          (2) Be connected to the under-pressure alarm system by a four-wire, 16-ampere shielded flexible cable; and

          (j) A fluid displacement system must include a pressure-indicating device that displays the pressure in the fluid displacement system injection line. This device must be within 6 meters (19.7 feet) of the fluid injection connection.

          (k) If a fluid displacement system used to inject inert gas or another medium into the cargo tank of a barge being gas-freed is capable of producing a pressure greater than 2 psig, a pressure relief valve must be installed in the fluid displacement system injection line between the fluid injection source and the fluid injection connection that—

          (1) Relieves at a predetermined pressure such that the pressure in the fluid displacement system at the fluid injection connection does not exceed 1.5 psig;

          (2) Has a relieving capacity equal to or greater than the maximum volumetric flow capacity of the fluid displacement system;

          (n) If the pressure relief valve is not designed with a minimum vapor discharge velocity of 30 meters (98.4 feet) per second, the relieving capacity test required by paragraphs (k)(4) and (l)(5) of this section must be carried out with a flame screen or flame arrester fitted at the discharge opening.

          (o) A pressure indicating device must be provided by the facility for installation at the connection required by 46 CFR 39.6003(b).

          (1) The minimum amount of open area for air flow on the barge has been determined so that the pressure in the cargo tank cannot be less than 14.5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) (−0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) at the maximum flow capacity of the vapor-moving device;

          (2) Any hatch or fitting providing the minimum open area has been secured open so that accidental closure is not possible; and

          (3) The hatch and/or fitting must be opened before the pressure in the cargo tank falls below 10 percent of the highest setting of any of the barge's vacuum relief valves.

          (j) 33 CFR 154.2150(p) and (q) apply to a TBCF's VCS.

        § 155.230   Emergency control systems for tank barges.

#### § § 155.230

        (a)  This section does not apply to foreign vessels engaged in innocent passage (that is, neither entering nor leaving a U.S. port); it applies to tank barges and vessels towing them on the following waters:

        (1) On the territorial sea of the U.S. [as defined in Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, it is the belt of waters 12 nautical miles wide with its shoreward boundary the baseline of the territorial sea], unless—

        (i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the towing vessel; and

        (ii) The barge's coastwise route is restricted, on its certificate of inspection (COI), so the barge may operate “in fair weather only, within 20 miles of shore,” or with words to that effect. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may define “fair weather” on the COI.

        (2) In Great Lakes service unless—

        (i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the towing vessel; and

        (ii) The barge's route is restricted, on its certificate of inspection (COI), so the barge may operate “in fair weather only, within 5 miles of a harbor,” or with words to that effect. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may define “fair weather” on the COI.

        (3) On Long Island Sound. For the purposes of this section, Long Island Sound comprises the waters between the baseline of the territorial sea on the eastern end (from Watch Hill Point, Rhode Island, to Montauk Point, Long Island) and a line drawn north and south from Premium Point, New York (about 40°54.5′ N, 73°45.5′ W), to Hewlett Point, Long Island (about 40°50.5′ N, 73°45.3′ W), on the western end.

        (4) In the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

        (5) On the waters of Admiralty Inlet north of Marrowstone Point (approximately 48°06′ N, 122°41′ W).

        (b)  If you are the owner or operator of a single-hull tank barge or of a vessel towing it, you must adequately man and equip either the barge or the vessel towing it so the crew can arrest the barge by employing  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Moreover, the crew must be able to arrest or retrieve the barge by employing either  or  described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively. If you are the owner or operator of a double-hull tank barge, you must adequately equip it and train its crew or, if it is unmanned, train the crew of the vessel towing it, so the crew can retrieve the barge by employing  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (1)  Each single-hull tank barge, whether manned or unmanned, must be equipped with an operable anchoring system that conforms to 46 CFR 32.15-15; except that, for barges operating only on the West Coast of the U.S., a system comprising heavy surge gear and bridle legs may serve instead of the anchoring system. Because these systems will also serve as emergency control systems, the owner or operator must ensure that they meet the following criteria:

        (i)  When the barge is underway—

        (A) The system is ready for immediate use;

        (B) No more than two crewmembers are needed to operate the system and anchor the barge or arrest its movement;

        (C) While preparing to anchor the barge or arrest its movement, the operator of the system should confer with the master or mate of the towing vessel regarding appropriate length of cable or chain to use; and

        (D) Each operator of the system should wear a safety belt or harness secured by a lanyard to a lifeline, drop line, or fixed structure such as a welded padeye, if the sea or the weather warrants this precaution. Each safety belt, harness, lanyard, lifeline, and drop line must meet the specifications of ANSI A10.14 (incorporated by reference, see § 155.140).

        (ii)  The owner or operator of the system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the system is ready for immediate use, and must include a visual inspection of the equipment that comprises the system in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must also verify that the system is being maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection need not include actual demonstration of the operation of the equipment or system.

        (iii)  On each manned barge, every crewmember must be thoroughly familiar with the operation of the system. On each vessel towing an unmanned barge, every deck crewmember must be thoroughly familiar with the operation of the system installed on the barge. If during the last 12 months the system was not used to anchor or arrest the movement of the barge, then a drill on the use of the system must be conducted within the next month. The drill need not involve actual deployment of the system. However, it must allow every participant to demonstrate the competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed to ensure that everyone assigned a duty in anchoring or arresting the movement of the barge is ready to do his or her duty.

        (2)  If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph (a) of this section, you must have installed an emergency retrieval system or some other measure acceptable to the Coast Guard, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Any such system must meet the following criteria:

        (i)  The system must use an emergency towline with  the same pulling strength as required of the primary towline. The emergency towline must be readily available on either the barge or the vessel towing it. The towing vessel must have on board equipment to regain control of the barge and continue towing (using the emergency towline), without having to place personnel on board the barge.

        (ii)  The system must use a stowage arrangement that ensures the readiness of the emergency towline and the availability of all retrieval equipment for immediate use in an emergency whenever the barge is being towed astern.

        (iii)  The owner or operator of the system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the emergency retrieval system is ready for immediate use, and must include a visual inspection of the equipment that comprises the system in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must also verify that the system is being maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection need not include actual demonstration of the operation of the equipment or system.

        (iv)  Barge-retrieval drills must take place annually, and not more than one month after a master or mate responsible for supervising barge retrieval begins employment on a vessel that tows tank barges.

        (A) Each drill must allow every participant to demonstrate the competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed to ensure that everyone assigned a duty in barge retrieval is ready to do his or her part to regain control of a drifting barge.

        (B) If the drill includes actual operation of a retrieval system, it must be conducted under the supervision of the master or mate responsible for retrieval, and preferably in open waters free from navigational hazards so as to minimize risk to personnel and the environment.

        (3)  If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph (a) of this section, you may use an alternative measure or system fit for retrieving a barge or arresting its movement as a substitute for Measure 2, described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Before you use such a measure or system, however, it must receive the approval of the Commandant (CG-ENG). It will receive this approval if it provides protection against grounding of the tank vessel comparable to that provided by one of the other two measures described in this section.

#### § § 155.760

        (a) The COTP or OCMI may require the vessel operator of any vessel that is required to have transfer procedures under § 155.720 to amend those procedures if the COTP or OCMI finds that the transfer procedures do not meet the requirements of this part.

        (b) The COTP or OCMI shall notify the vessel operator in writing of any inadequacies in the oil transfer procedures. The vessel operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on and proposals for amending the procedures within 14 days from the date of the COTP or OCMI notice. After considering all relevant material presented, the COTP or OCMI shall notify the vessel operator of any amendment required or adopted, or the COTP or OCMI may rescind the notice. The amendment becomes effective 30 days after the vessel operator receives the notice, unless the vessel operator petitions the Commandant to review the COTP or OCMI notice, in which case its effective date is delayed pending a decision by the Commandant. Petitions to the Commandant must be submitted in writing via the COTP or OCMI who issued the requirement to amend.

        (c) If the COTP or OCMI finds that there is a condition requiring immediate action to prevent the discharge or risk of discharge that makes the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section impractical or contrary to the public interest, he or she may issue an amendment effective on the date the vessel operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the COTP or OCMI includes a brief statement of the reasons for the findings in the notice, and the vessel operator may petition the Commandant, in any manner, to review the amendment. The petition does not postpone the amendment.

      Subpart D—Tank Vessel Response Plans for Oil

**Source:** Source: CGD 91-034, 61 FR 1081, Jan. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

        § 155.1010   Purpose.

#### § § 155.1010

        The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil spill response plans for certain vessels. The planning criteria in this subpart are intended for use in response plan development and the identification of resources necessary to respond to the oil spill scenarios prescribed during the planning process. The development of a response plan prepares the vessel owner or operator and the vessel's crew to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident.

        § 155.1015   Applicability.

#### § § 155.1015

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this subpart applies to each vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue, and that—

        (2) Operates on the navigable waters of the United States; or

        (3) Transfers oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

        (b) This subpart also applies to vessels which engage in oil lightering operations in the marine environment beyond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured, when the cargo lightered is destined for a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

        (c) This subpart does not apply to the following types of vessels:

        (1) Public vessels and vessels deemed public vessels under 14 U.S.C. 3908.

        (2) Vessels that, although constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue, are not storing or carrying oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue.

        (3) Dedicated response vessels when conducting response operations.

        (4) Vessels of opportunity when conducting response operations in a response area.

        (5) Offshore supply vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.

        (6) Fishing or fishing tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101 of not more than 750 gross tons when engaged only in the fishing industry.

        (7) Foreign-flag vessels engaged in innocent passage through the territorial sea or transit passage through a strait used for international navigation, unless bound for or departing from a port or place of the United States.

        (8) Vessels carrying oil as a secondary cargo and measuring 400 gross tons or greater.

        (d) Vessels covered by this subpart that are not operating within the navigable waters or the exclusive economic zone of the United States must meet all requirements of this subpart except for—

        (1) Identifying and ensuring, through contract or other approved means, the availability of response resources including the shore-based spill management team;

        (2) Providing the geographic-specific appendices required in § 155.1035, 155.1040, or 155.1045, as appropriate; and

        (3) Identifying and designating a qualified individual and alternate qualified individual required in § 155.1026.

        (p) Appendix B of this part sets out caps that recognize the practical and technical limits of response capabilities for which an individual vessel owner or operator can contract in advance. Table 6 in appendix B lists the contracting caps that are applicable, as of February 18, 1993, and that are slated to apply on February 18, 1998. The owner or operator of a vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as a primary cargo, whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in table 6, shall identify commercial sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed for each tier or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower, to the extent that this equipment is available. The equipment so identified must be capable of arriving on scene no later than the applicable tier response times contained in § 155.1050(g) or as quickly as the nearest available resource permits. A response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of this additional equipment. No contract is required.

        (q) The Coast Guard will continue to evaluate the environmental benefits, cost efficiency and practicality of increasing mechanical recovery capability requirements. This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a public notice and comment process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include and evaluation of:

        (1) Best available technologies for containment and recovery;

        (2) Oil spill tracking technology;

        (3) High rate response techniques;

        (4) Other applicable response technologies; and

        (5) Increases in the availability of private response resources.

Both announced and unannounced exercises must be included. The following are the minimum exercise requirements for vessels covered by this subpart:

        (1) Qualified individual notification exercises, which must be conducted quarterly;

        (2) Emergency procedures exercises, which must be conducted quarterly;

        (3) Shore-based spill management team tabletop exercises, which must be conducted annually. In a triennial period, at least one of these exercises must include a worst case discharge scenario;

        (4) Oil spill removal organization equipment deployment exercises, which must be conducted annually; and

        (5) An exercise of the entire response plan, which must be conducted every 3 years. The vessel owner or operator shall design the exercise program so that all components of the response plan are exercised at least once every 3 years. All of the components do not have to be exercised at one time; they may be exercised over the 3-year period through the required exercises or through an area exercise.

        (b) Annually, at least one of the exercises listed in § 155.1060(a) (2) and (4) must be unannounced. An unannounced exercise is one in which the personnel participating in the exercise have not been advised in advance of the exact date, time, and scenario of the exercise.

        (c) A vessel owner or operator shall participate in unannounced exercises, as directed by the Coast Guard COTP. The objectives of the unannounced exercises will be to evaluate notifications and equipment deployment for responses to average most probable discharge spill scenarios outlined in vessel response plans. The unannounced exercises will be limited to four per area per year, an area being that geographic area for which a separate and distinct Area Contingency Plan has been prepared, as described in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. After participating in an unannounced exercise directed by a COTP, the owner or operator will not be required to participate in another unannounced exercise for at least 3 years from the date of the exercise.

        (d) A vessel owner or operator shall participate in area exercises as directed by the applicable on-scene coordinator. The area exercises will involve equipment deployment to respond to the spill scenario developed by the exercise design team, of which the vessel owner or operator will be a member. After participating in an area exercise, a vessel owner or operator will not be required to participate in another area exercise for at least 6 years.

        (e) The vessel owner or operator shall ensure that adequate exercise records are maintained. The following records are required:

        (1) On board the vessel, records of the qualified individual notification exercises and the emergency procedures exercises. These exercises may be documented in the ship's log or may be kept in a separate exercise log.

        (2) At the United States' location of either the qualified individual, spill management team, the vessel owner or operator, or the oil spill removal organization, records of exercises conducted off the vessel. Response plans must indicate the location of these records.

        (f) Records described in paragraph (e) of this section must be maintained and available to the Coast Guard for 3 years following completion of the exercises.

        (g) The response plan submitted to meet the requirements of this subpart must specify the planned exercise program. The plan shall detail the exercise program, including the types of exercises, frequencies, scopes, objectives, and the scheme for exercising the entire response plan every 3 years.

        (h) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the vessel response plan exercise requirements. These guidelines are available from the TASC DEPT Warehouse, 33141Q 75th Avenue, Landover, MD 20875 (fax: 301-386-5394, stock number USCG-X0241). Compliance with an alternative program that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and has been approved under § 155.1065 will also satisfy the vessel response plan exercise requirements.

        § 155.1230   Response plan development and evaluation criteria.

#### § § 155.1230

        (a) Owners and operators of vessels that carry animal fats or vegetable oils as a primary cargo must provide information in their plan that identifies—

        (1) Procedures and strategies for responding to a worst case discharge of animal fats or vegetable oils to the maximum extent practicable; and

        (2) Sources of the equipment and supplies necessary to contain, recover, and mitigate such a discharge.

        (b) An owner or operator of a vessel carrying animal fats or vegetable oils as a primary cargo must ensure that any equipment identified in a response plan is capable of operating in the conditions expected in the geographic area(s) in which the vessel operates using the criteria in Table 1 of Appendix B of this part. When evaluating the operability of equipment, the vessel owner or operator must consider limitations that are identified in the Area Contingency Plans for the COTP zones in which the vessel operates, including—

        (1) Ice conditions;

        (2) Debris;

        (3) Temperature ranges; and

        (4) Weather-related visibility.

        (c) The owner or operator of a vessel carrying animal fats or vegetable oils as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan and ensure, through contract or other approved means, the availability of required equipment including—

        (1) Containment boom, sorbent boom, or other methods for containing oil floating on the surface or to protect shorelines from impact;

        (2) Oil recovery devices appropriate for the type of animal fats or vegetable oils carried; and

        (3) Other appropriate equipment necessary to respond to a discharge involving the type of animal fats or vegetable oils carried.

        (d) Response resources identified in a response plan under paragraph (c) of this section must be capable of arriving on-scene within the applicable Tier 1 response times specified in this paragraph. An oil spill removal organization may not be listed in the plan unless the organization has provided written consent to be listed in the plan as an available resource. Response times from the time of discovery of a discharge are as follows:

        (e) The owner or operator of a vessel carrying animal fats or vegetable oils as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan and ensure the availability of the following resources through contract or other approved means:

        (1) A salvage company with appropriate expertise and equipment.

        (2) A company with vessel firefighting capability that will respond to casualties in the area(s) in which the vessel is operating.

        (f) Vessel owners or operators must identify intended sources of the resources required under paragraph (e) of this section capable of being deployed to the areas in which the vessel will operate. A company may not be listed in the plan unless the company has provided written consent to be listed in the plan as an available resource. To meet this requirement in a response plan submitted for approval or reapproval on or after February 18, 1998, the vessel owner or operator must identify both the intended sources of this capability and demonstrate that the resources are capable of being deployed to the port nearest to the area where the vessel operates within 24 hours of discovery of a discharge.

        (g) The owner or operator of a vessel carrying animal fats or vegetable oils as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, certain resources required by subpart D, § 155.1035(c)(5)(ii) and § 155.1040(c)(5)(i), as applicable.

        (1) Resources must include—

        (i) Fendering equipment;

        (ii) Transfer hoses and connection equipment; and

        (iii) Portable pumps and ancillary equipment necessary to offload the vessel's largest cargo tank in 24 hours of continuous operation.

        (2) Resources must be capable of reaching the locations in which the vessel operates within the stated times following notification:

        (i) Inland, nearshore, and Great Lakes waters—12 hours.

        (ii) Offshore waters and rivers and canals—18 hours.

        (iii) Open ocean waters—36 hours.

        (3) For barges operating in rivers and canals as defined in this subpart, the requirements of this paragraph (g)(3) may be met by listing resources capable of being deployed in an area within the response times in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A vessel owner or operator may not identify such resources in a plan unless the response organization has provided written consent to be identified in a plan as an available resource.

        (h) The response plan for a vessel that is located in any environment with year-round preapproval for use of dispersants suitable for animal fats and vegetable oils and that handles, stores, or transports animal fats or vegetable oils may request a credit for up to 25 percent of the worst case planning volume set forth by subpart D of this part. To receive this credit, the vessel owner or operator must identify in the plan and ensure, by contract or other approved means, the availability of specified resources to apply the dispersants and to monitor their effectiveness. To extent of the credit will be based on the volumes of the dispersant available to sustain operations at the manufacturers' recommended dosage rates. Other spill mitigation techniques, including mechanical dispersal, may be identified in the response plan, provided they are in accordance with the NCP and the applicable ACP. Resources identified for plan credit should be capable of being on scene within 12 hours of a discovery of a discharge. Identification of these resources does not imply that they will be authorized for use. Actual authorization for use during the spill response will be governed by the provisions of the NCP and the applicable ACP.

      Subpart I—Salvage and Marine Firefighting

**Source:** Source: USCG-1998-3417, 73 FR 80649, Dec. 31, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

        § 155.4010   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 155.4010

        (a) The purpose of this subpart is to establish vessel response plan  and  requirements for vessels, that are carrying group I-IV oils, and that are required by §§ 155.1015 and 155.5015 to have a vessel response plan.

        (b)  and  actions can save lives and property, and prevent the escalation of potential oil spills to worst case discharge scenarios.

        (c) A planholder must ensure by  that response resources are available to respond. However, the response criteria specified in the regulations (e.g., quantities of response resources and their arrival times) are planning criteria, not performance standards, and are based on assumptions that may not exist during an actual incident, as stated in 33 CFR 155.1010. Compliance with the regulations is based upon whether a covered response plan ensures that adequate response resources are available, not on whether the actual performance of those response resources after an incident meets specified arrival times or other planning criteria. Failure to meet specified criteria during an actual spill response does not necessarily mean that the planning requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 U.S.C. 1251-1376) and regulations were not met. The Coast Guard will exercise its enforcement discretion in light of all facts and circumstances.

        (a)(1) If you have an existing approved vessel response plan required by § 155.1015, you must have your vessel response plan updated and submitted to the Coast Guard by February 22, 2011.

        (2) All new or existing vessels operating on the navigable waters of the United States or transferring oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, that meet the applicability requirements of § 155.1015, that do not have an approved vessel response plan, must comply with § 155.1065.

        (3) Your vessel may not conduct oil transport or transfer operations if—

        (i) You have not submitted a plan to the Coast Guard in accordance with § 155.1065 prior to February 22, 2011;

        (ii) The Coast Guard determines that the response resources referenced in your plan do not meet the requirements of this subpart;

        (iii) The contracts or agreements cited in your plan have lapsed or are otherwise no longer valid;

        (iv) You are not operating in accordance with your plan; or

        means a plan that outlines the responsibilities and actions during a marine fire incident. The principle purpose is to explain the resource provider's role, and the support which can be provided, during marine firefighting incidents. Policies, responsibilities and procedures for coordination of on-scene forces are provided in the plan. It should be designed for use in conjunction with other state, regional and local contingency and resource mobilization plans.

        means the area extending seaward 12 miles from the boundary lines defined in 46 CFR part 7, except in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, a nearshore area is one extending seaward 12 miles from the line of demarcation (COLREG lines) as defined in §§ 80.740 through 80.850 of this chapter.

        means the area up to 38 nautical miles seaward of the outer boundary of the nearshore area.

        means that a marine firefighting professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who can determine the steps needed to control and extinguish a marine fire in accordance with a vessel's stability and structural integrity assessment if necessary.

        means that a salvage professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who has the ability to assess the vessel's stability and structural integrity. The data collected during this assessment will be used in the salvage software calculations and to determine necessary steps to salve the vessel.

        means those techniques for refloating a vessel aside from using pumps. These services include, but are not limited to, the use of pontoons, air bags or compressed air.

        means Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession of the United States.

        means a resource provider listed in the vessel response plan as the principal entity contracted for providing specific salvage and/or marine firefighting services and resources, when multiple resource providers are listed for that service, for each of the COTP zones in which a vessel operates. The primary resource provider will be the point of contact for the planholder, the Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) and the Unified Command, in matters related to specific resources and services, as required in § 155.4030(a).

        means contacting the salvage and/or marine firefighting resource providers, by phone or other means of communications to discuss and assess the situation. The person contacted must be competent to consult on a determination of the appropriate course of action and initiation of a response plan.

        means an entity that provides personnel, equipment, supplies, and other capabilities necessary to perform salvage and/or marine firefighting services identified in the response plan, and has been arranged by contract or other approved means. The resource provider must be selected in accordance with § 155.4050. For marine firefighting services, resource providers can include public firefighting resources as long as they are able, in accordance with the requirements of § 155.4045(d), and willing to provide the services needed.

        means any act undertaken to assist a vessel in potential or actual danger, to prevent loss of life, damage or destruction of the vessel and release of its contents into the marine environment.

        means a plan developed to guide salvage operations except those identified as specialized salvage operations.

        means a salvage plan developed to carry out a specialized salvage operation, including heavy lift and/or subsurface product removal.

        means the safe removal of oil from a vessel that has sunk or is partially submerged underwater. These actions can include pumping or other means to transfer the oil to a storage device.

        means having salvage resources on scene that can perform examination and analysis of the vessel's hull and equipment below the water surface. These resources also include the ability to determine the bottom configuration and type for the body of water. This service can be accomplished through the use of equipment such as sonar, magnetometers, remotely operated vehicles or divers. When divers are used to perform these services, the time requirements for this service apply and not those of diving services support.

        (a) You must identify, in the geographical-specific appendices of your VRP, the  and  services listed in Table 155.4030(b)—Salvage and Marine Firefighting Services and Response Timeframes. Additionally, you must list those  that you have contracted to provide these services. You may list multiple  for each service, but you must identify which one is your primary  for each Captain of the Port (COTP) zone in which you operate. A method of contact, consistent with the requirements in §§ 155.1035(e)(6)(ii), 155.1040(e)(5)(ii), and 155.5035(e)(6)(ii) must also be listed, in the geographical-specific appendices of your VRP, adjacent to the name of the

        (b) Table 155.4030(b) lists the required  and  services and response timeframes.

        (c)  You must ensure that all  and  are integrated into the response organizations listed in your plans. The response organization must be consistent with the requirements set forth in §§ 155.1035(d), 155.1040(d), 155.1045(d), and 155.5035(d).

        (d)  Your plan must include provisions on how the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers will coordinate with other response resources, response organizations, and OSROs. For example, you will need to identify how salvage and marine firefighting assessment personnel will coordinate response activity with oil spill removal organizations. For services that, by law, require public assistance, there must be clear guidelines on how service providers will interact with those organizations. The information contained in the response plan must be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans (ACPs) and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan as found in §§ 155.1030(h) and 155.5030(f).

        (e)  Your VRP must identify towing vessels with the proper characteristics, horsepower, and bollard pull to tow your vessel(s). These towing vessels must be capable of operating in environments where the winds are up to 40 knots.

        (f)  Your salvage resource provider must be able to bring on scene a pumping capability that can offload the vessel's largest cargo or fuel tank, whichever is greater, in 24 hours of continuous operation. This is required for both emergency transfer and lightering operations.

        (g)  Your plan must list the proper type and amount of extinguishing agent needed to combat an oil fire involving your vessel's cargo fuel, other contents, and superstructure. If your primary extinguishing agent is foam or water, you must identify resources in your plan that are able to pump, for a minimum of 20 minutes, at least 0.016 gallons per minute per square foot of the deck area of your vessel, or an appropriate rate for spaces that this rate is not suitable for and if needed, an adequate source of foam. These resources described are to be supplied by the resource provider, external to the vessel's own firefighting system.

        (h)  You must have subsurface product removal capability if your vessel(s) operates in waters of 40 feet or more. Your resource provider must have the capability of removing bulk liquid cargo and fuel from your sunken vessel to a depth equal to the maximum your vessel operates in up to 150 feet.

        § 155.4032   Other resource provider considerations.

#### § § 155.4032

        (a)  If another resource provider, not listed in the approved plan for the specific service required, is to be contracted for a specific response, justification for the selection of that resource provider needs to be provided to, and approved by, the FOSC. Only under exceptional circumstances will the FOSC authorize deviation from the resource provider listed in the approved vessel response plan in instances where that would best affect a more successful response.

        (b)  Your resource providers must have the capability to implement the necessary engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to safeguard their workers when providing salvage and marine firefighting services, as found in 33 CFR 155.1055(e) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q).

        § 155.4035   Required pre-incident information and arrangements for the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers listed in response plans.

#### § § 155.4035

        (a) You must provide the information listed in §§ 155.1035(c), 155.1040(c), and 155.5035(c) to your salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.

        (b)  (1) You must prepare a vessel pre-fire plan in accordance with NFPA 1405, Guide for Land-Based Firefighters Who Respond to Marine Vessel Fires, Chapter 9 (Incorporation by reference,  § 155.140). If the planholder's vessel pre-fire plan is one that meets another regulation, such as SOLAS Chapter II-2, Regulation 15, or international standard, a copy of that specific fire plan must also be given to the resource provider(s) instead of the NFPA 1405 pre-fire plan, and be attached to the VRP.

        (2) The marine firefighting resource provider(s) you are required to identify in your plan must be given a copy of the plan. Additionally, they must certify in writing to you that they find the plan acceptable and agree to implement it to mitigate a potential or actual fire.

        (3) If a marine firefighting resource provider subcontracts to other organizations, each subcontracted organization must also receive a copy of the vessel pre-fire plan.

        § 155.4040   Response times for each salvage and marine firefighting service.

#### § § 155.4040

        (a) You must ensure, by contract or other approved means, that your resource provider(s) is capable of providing the services within the required timeframes.

        (1) If your vessel is at the pier or transiting a COTP zone within the continental United States (CONUS), the timeframes in Table 155.4030(b) apply as listed.

        (2) If your vessel is at the pier or transiting a COTP zone outside the continental United States (OCONUS), the timeframes in Table 155.4030(b) apply as follows:

        (i) Inland waters and nearshore area timeframes apply from the COTP city out to and including the 12 mile point.

        (ii) Offshore area timeframes apply from 12 to 50 miles outside the COTP city.

        (3) If your vessel transits within an OCONUS COTP zone that is outside the areas described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but within the inland waters or the nearshore or offshore area, you must submit in writing, in your plan, the steps you will take to address salvage and marine firefighting needs in the event these services are required.

        (b) The timeframe starts when anyone in your response organization receives notification of a potential or actual incident. It ends when the service reaches the ship, the outer limit of the nearshore area, the outer limit of the offshore area, the 12 or 50-mile point from the COTP city, or a point identified in your response plan for areas OCONUS.

        (c) Table 155.4040(c) provides additional amplifying information for vessels transiting within the nearshore and offshore areas of CONUS or within 50 miles of an OCONUS COTP city.

        (d)  To apply the timeframes to your vessel's situation, follow these procedures:

        (1) Identify if your vessel operates CONUS or OCONUS.

        (2) If your vessel is calling at any CONUS pier or an OCONUS pier within 50 miles of a COTP city, you must list the pier location by facility name or city and ensure that the marine firefighting resource provider can reach the locations within the specified response times in Table 155.4030(b).

        (3) If your vessel is transiting within CONUS inland waters, nearshore or offshore areas or the Great Lakes, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching your vessel within the appropriate response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).

        (4) If your vessel is transiting within 12 miles or less from an OCONUS COTP city, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching a point 12 miles from the harbor of the COTP city within the nearshore area response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).

        (5) If your vessel is transiting between 12 and 50 miles from an OCONUS COTP city, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching a point 50 miles from the harbor of the COTP city within the offshore area response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).

        (6) If your vessel transits inland waters or the nearshore or offshore areas OCONUS, but is more than 50 miles from a COTP city, you must still contract for salvage and marine firefighting services and provide a description of how you intend to respond and an estimated response time when these services are required, however, none of the time limits listed in Table 155.4030(b) will apply to these services.

        § 155.4045   Required agreements or contracts with the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.

#### § § 155.4045

        (a) You may only list resource providers in your plan that have been arranged by contract or other approved means.

        (b) You must obtain written consent from the resource provider stating that they agree to be listed in your plan. This consent must state that the resource provider agrees to provide the services that are listed in §§ 155.4030(a) through 155.4030(h), and that these services are capable of arriving within the response times listed in Table 155.4030(b). This consent may be included in the contract with the resource provider or in a separate document.

        (c) This written consent must be available to the Coast Guard for inspection. The response plan must identify the location of this written consent, which must be:

        (1) On board the vessel; or

        (2) With a qualified individual located in the United States.

        (d) Public marine firefighters may only be listed out to the maximum extent of the public resource's jurisdiction, unless other agreements are in place. A public marine firefighting resource may agree to respond beyond their jurisdictional limits, but the Coast Guard considers it unreasonable to expect public marine firefighting resources to do this.

        § 155.4050   Ensuring that the salvors and marine firefighters are adequate.

#### § § 155.4050

        (a) You are responsible for determining the adequacy of the resource providers you intend to include in your plan.

        (b) When determining adequacy of the resource provider, you must select a resource provider that meets the following selection criteria to the maximum extent possible:

        (1)  is currently working in response service needed.

        (2)  has documented history of participation in successful salvage and/or marine firefighting operations, including equipment deployment.

        (3)  owns or has contracts for equipment needed to perform response services.

        (4)  has personnel with documented training certification and degree experience (Naval Architecture, Fire Science, etc.).

        (5)  has 24-hour availability of personnel and equipment, and history of response times compatible with the time requirements in the regulation.

        (6)  has on-going continuous training program. For marine firefighting providers, they meet the training guidelines in NFPA 1001, 1005, 1021, 1405, and 1561 (Incorporation by reference, see § 155.140), show equivalent training, or demonstrate qualification through experience.

        (7)  has successful record of participation in drills and exercises.

        (8)  has salvage or marine firefighting plans used and approved during real incidents.

        (9)  has membership in relevant national and/or international organizations.

        (10)  has insurance that covers the salvage and/or marine firefighting services which they intend to provide.

        (11)  has sufficient up front capital to support an operation.

        (12)  has equipment and experience to work in the specific regional geographic environment(s) that the vessel operates in (e.g., bottom type, water turbidity, water depth, sea state and temperature extremes).

        (13)  has the logistical and transportation support capability required to sustain operations for extended periods of time in arduous sea states and conditions.

        (14)  has the capability to implement the necessary engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to safeguard the health and safety of their workers when providing salvage and marine firefighting services.

        (15)  has familiarity with the salvage and marine firefighting protocol contained in the local ACPs for each COTP area for which they are contracted.

        (c) A  need not meet all of the selection criteria in order for you to choose them as a provider. They must, however, be selected on the basis of meeting the criteria to the maximum extent possible.

        (d) You must certify in your plan that these factors were considered when you chose your resource provider.

        § 155.4052   Drills and exercises.

#### § § 155.4052

        (a) A vessel owner or operator required by §§ 155.1035, 155.1040, 155.5035 to have a response plan shall conduct exercises as necessary to ensure that the plan will function in an emergency. Both announced and unannounced exercises must be included.

        (b) The following are the minimum exercise requirements for vessels covered by this subpart:

        (1) Remote assessment and consultation exercises, which must be conducted quarterly;

        (2) Emergency procedures exercises, which must be conducted quarterly;

        (3) Shore-based salvage and shore-based marine firefighting management team tabletop exercises, which must be conducted annually;

        (4) Response provider equipment deployment exercises, which must be conducted annually;

        (5) An exercise of the entire response plan, which must be conducted every three years. The vessel owner or operator shall design the exercise program so that all components of the response plan are exercised at least once every three years. All of the components do not have to be exercised at one time; they may be exercised over the 3-year period through the required exercises or through an area exercise; and

        (6) Annually, at least one of the exercises listed in § 155.4052(b)(2) and (4) must be unannounced. An unannounced exercise is one in which the personnel participating in the exercise have not been advised in advance of the exact date, time, or scenario of the exercise.

        (7) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the vessel response plan exercise requirements. These guidelines are available on the Internet at  Once on that Web site, select the link for “Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP)” and then select “Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines”. Compliance with an alternate program that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 155.1060(a) and 155.5061, and has been approved under 33 CFR 155.1065 and 155.5065 will also satisfy the vessel response plan exercise requirements.

        § 155.4055   Temporary waivers from meeting one or more of the specified response times.

#### § § 155.4055

        (a) You may submit a request for a temporary waiver of a specific response time requirement, if you are unable to identify a resource provider who can meet the response time.

        (b) Your request must be specific as to the COTP zone, operating environment, salvage or marine firefighting service, and response time.

        (c) Emergency lightering requirements set forth in § 155.4030(b) will not be subject to the waiver provisions of this subpart.

        (d) You must submit your request to the Assistant Commandant for Response Policy (CG-5R), via the local COTP for final approval. The local COTP will evaluate and comment on the waiver before forwarding the waiver request, via the District, to the Assistant Commandant (CG-5R) for final approval.

        (e) Your request must include the reason why you are unable to meet the time requirements. It must also include how you intend to correct the shortfall, the time it will take to do so, and what arrangements have been made to provide the required response resources and their estimated response times.

        (f) Assistant Commandant for Response Policy (CG-5R), will only approve waiver requests up to a specified time period, depending on the service addressed in the waiver request, the operating environment, and other relevant factors. These time periods are listed in Table 155.4055(g).

        (g) Table 155.4055(g) lists the service waiver time periods.

      Subpart J—Nontank Vessel Response Plans

**Source:** Source: USCG-2009-1070, 78 FR 60124, Sept. 30, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

        § 155.5010   Purpose.

#### § § 155.5010

        The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil spill response plans for nontank vessels. The planning criteria in this subpart are intended for use in nontank vessel oil spill response plan development and the identification of resources necessary to respond to a nontank vessel's worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge. The development of a nontank vessel response plan prepares the vessel's crew and ship management to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They are planning criteria based upon a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident. Note to § 155.5010: For nontank vessels that are mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs), additional oil spill planning standards are found in 30 CFR part 254.

        § 155.5012   Deviation from response plan.

#### § § 155.5012

        The owner or operator of a nontank vessel required to have a vessel response plan (VRP) under this subpart may not deviate from the approved VRP unless the President or Federal On-Scene Coordinator determines that the deviation from the VRP would provide for a more expeditious or effective response to the spill or mitigation of its environmental effects.

        § 155.5015   Applicability.

#### § § 155.5015

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this subpart applies to each self-propelled vessel that—

        (1) Carries oil of any kind as fuel for main propulsion;

        (2) Is not a tank vessel or is not certificated as a tank vessel;

        (3) Operates upon the navigable waters of the United States, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(17a); and

        (4) Is 400 gross tons or more as measured under the convention measurement system in 46 U.S.C. 14302 or the regulatory measurement system of 46 U.S.C. 14502 for vessels not measured under 46 U.S.C. 14302.

        (b) This subpart also applies to vessels carrying oil as secondary cargo and that meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) For Integrated Tug Barge (ITB) units that are not certificated as tank vessels, the tonnage used to determine applicability of these regulations is the aggregate tonnage of the ITB combination, and the oil capacity used to determine the worst case discharge volume is the aggregate oil capacity of the ITB combination.

        (d) This subpart does not apply to the following types of vessels—

        (1) Public vessels;

        (2) Foreign-flag vessels engaged in innocent passage through the territorial sea or transit passage through a strait used for international navigation, unless bound for or departing from a port or place of the United States;

        (3) Vessels that carry oil as a primary cargo and are required to submit a vessel response plan (VRP) in accordance with 33 CFR part 155, subpart D;

        (4) Vessels constructed or operated in such a manner that no oil in any form can be carried onboard as fuel for propulsion or cargo;

        (5) Permanently moored craft; and

        (6) Inactive vessels.

        Note to § 155.5015: VRP requirements for tank vessels are found in subpart D of this part.

        § 155.5020   Definitions.

#### § § 155.5020

        Except as otherwise defined in this section, the definitions in §§ 155.110 and 155.1020 apply to this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart only, the term—

        means oil, not carried as fuel, which is carried in bulk, and that is transported to and off-loaded at a port or place by a vessel. It does not include—

        (1) Oil carried in integral tanks, marine portable tanks, or independent tanks for use by machinery, helicopters, and boats carried onboard the vessel, or for use by helicopters that are directly supporting the vessel's primary operations;

        (2) Oil transferred from a towing vessel to a vessel in its tow to operate installed machinery other than the propulsion plant; or

        (3) Oil recovered during oil spill response operations.

        includes—

        (1) A written contractual agreement between a vessel owner or operator and a required response resource provider. The agreement must identify and ensure the availability of specified personnel and equipment required under this subpart within stipulated response times in the applicable Captain of the Port (COTP) zone or specified geographic areas;

        (2) Certification by the vessel owner or operator that specified personnel and equipment required under this subpart are owned, operated, or under the direct control of the vessel owner or operator, and are available within stipulated response times in the applicable COTP zone or specified geographic areas;

        (3) Active membership with a local or regional required response resource provider that has identified specific personnel and equipment required under this subpart that are available to respond to a discharge within stipulated response times in the COTP zone or specified geographic areas;

        (4) A document that—

        (i) Identifies the personnel, equipment, and services capable of being provided by the required response resource provider within stipulated response times in the COTP zone or specified geographic areas;

        (ii) Sets out the parties' acknowledgment that the required response resource provider intends to commit the resources in the event of a response;

        (iii) Permits the Coast Guard to verify the availability of the identified response resources through tests, inspections, and exercises; and

        (iv) Is referenced in the vessel response plan; or

        (5) With the written consent of the required response resource provider, the identification of a required response resource provider with specified equipment and personnel that are available within stipulated response times in the COTP zone, port area, or specified geographic area. This paragraph is “other approved means” for only—

        (i) Nontank vessels with a fuel or cargo oil capacity of less than 250 barrels for maximum most probable discharge oil spill removal response resource requirements per 33 CFR 155.5050(e);

        (ii) Nontank vessels that carry group I through group IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater, but less than 2,500 barrels, for salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting response resources per 33 CFR 155.5050(i)(2);

        (iii) Nontank vessels that carry group I through group IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo with a capacity less than 250 barrels for salvage response resources in 33 CFR 155.5050(i)(3);

        (iv) Nontank vessels that carry group II through group IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater, but less than 2,500 barrels, for dispersant response resources per 33 CFR 155.5035(i)(7) and 33 CFR 155.5050(j); and

        (v) Nontank vessels that carry groups I through IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater, but less than 2,500 barrels, for aerial oil spill tracking to support oil spill assessment and cleanup activities per 33 CFR 155.5050(k).

        means all oils of any kind, which may be used to supply power or lubrication for primary or auxiliary purposes onboard the vessel in which it is carried.

        means a vessel that is out of service or laid up and has emptied its tanks of fuel except for the minimum amount of fuel necessary for the maintenance of the vessel's material condition. Such a vessel is considered not to be operating on the navigable waters of the United States for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5), unless the cognizant COTP determines that it poses an unacceptable risk to the marine environment due to the amount of oil carried for maintenance. A vessel would not be considered inactive if it carried oil as a cargo or cargo residue.

        or  means any tug barge combination in which a specially designed propulsion unit (tug) is mated to a cargo unit (barge) of a compatible special design or where a propulsion unit (tug) is mated to a cargo unit (barge) with a specially designed connection system such that the combined unit has operating characteristics and seakeeping capabilities that exceed, under all anticipated weather conditions, those of a tug and barge, where the tug is secured in the barge notch or on fenders by means such as wire rope, chains, lines, or other tackle now commonly used in offshore towing.

        or  means a discharge of—

        (1) Two thousand five hundred (2,500) barrels of oil, for vessels with a fuel and cargo capacity equal to or greater than 25,000 barrels; or

        (2) Ten percent of the vessel's fuel and cargo capacity, for vessels with a fuel and cargo capacity of less than 25,000 barrels.

        means navigable waters of the United States as defined in 33 CFR 2.36(b)(1), including the waters in 46 U.S.C. 2101(17a).

        means a vessel meeting the description provided in 33 CFR 155.5015(a).

        or  means any person or persons who own(s) or otherwise control(s) oil spill removal resources that are designed for, or are capable of, removing oil from the water or shoreline. Control of such resources through means other than ownership includes leasing or subcontracting of equipment or, in the case of trained personnel, by having contracts, evidence of employment, or consulting agreements. _OSRO_s provide response equipment and services, individually or in combination with subcontractors or associated contractors, under contract or other approved means, directly to a vessel owner or operator of a vessel or a facility required to have a response plan under 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5). OSROs are able to mobilize and deploy equipment or trained personnel and remove, store, and transfer recovered oil. Persons such as sales and marketing organizations (e.g., distributorships and manufacturer's representatives) that warehouse or store equipment for sale are not OSROs.

        means a protection and indemnity insurance group that provides liability insurance cover for the vessel owner or operator that would respond to an oil discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge by the vessel.

        means a watercraft that is not considered to be a vessel under the rule of construction in 1 U.S.C. 3, because it is not practically (as opposed to theoretically) used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water.

        means a vessel owned or bareboat-chartered and operated by the United States, or by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by a foreign nation, except when such vessel is engaged in commerce.

        or  and  means a shore-based representative of a vessel owner or operator who meets the requirements of 33 CFR 155.5026.

        means any incident involving a vessel that may create a significant risk of discharge of fuel or cargo oil. Such incidents include, but are not limited to, groundings, allisions, strandings, collisions, hull damage, fires, explosions, loss of propulsion, floodings, on-deck spills, or other similar occurrences.

        means the combination of required response resources and the times within which the resources must arrive on scene. Appendix B of this part, especially Tables 5 and 6, provide specific guidance on calculating the response resources required by a respective tier. Section 155.5050(g) sets forth the required times within which the response resources must arrive on scene. _Tier_s are applied to three categories of areas—

        (1) Higher volume port areas;

        (2) The Great Lakes; and

        (3) All other operating environments, including rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, offshore, and open ocean areas.

        means any movement of oil to or from a vessel by means of pumping, gravitation, or displacement. A transfer is considered to begin when the person in charge of the transferring vessel or facility and the person in charge of the receiving facility or vessel first meet to begin completing the declaration of inspection required by 33 CFR 156.150. A transfer is considered to be complete when all the connections for the transfer have been uncoupled and secured with blanks or other closure devices and both of the persons in charge have completed the declaration of inspection to include the date and time they complete the transfer.

        or  means a discharge in adverse weather conditions of a vessel's entire fuel or cargo oil, whichever is greater.

        § 155.5021   Operating restrictions.

#### § § 155.5021

        Nontank vessels subject to this subpart may not—

        (a) Operate upon the navigable waters of the United States unless in compliance with a vessel response plan (VRP) approved under § 155.5065.

        (b) Continue to operate on the navigable waters of the United States if—

        (1) The Coast Guard determines that the response resources identified in the vessel's certification statement do not meet the requirements of this subpart;

        (2) The contracts or agreements required in §§ 155.5050 and 155.5052 and the vessel's certification statement are no longer valid;

        (3) The vessel is not operating in compliance with the submitted VRP; or

        (4) The period of the VRP authorization has expired.

        § 155.5023   Interim operating authorization.

#### § § 155.5023

        (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 155.5021 of this subpart, a vessel may continue to operate for up to 2 years after the date of submission of a vessel response plan (VRP) pending approval of that VRP, if the vessel has received written authorization for continued operations from the Coast Guard.

        (b) To receive this authorization, the vessel owner or operator must certify in writing with an original or electronic signature to the Coast Guard that the vessel owner or operator has identified and has ensured, by contract or other approved means, the availability of the necessary private response resources to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge from their vessel.

        (c) Those nontank vessels temporarily authorized to operate under the provisions provided in this section must comply with 33 CFR 155.1070(c), (d), and (e).

        (C) Worst case discharge.

        (2) Nontank vessels with a capacity less than 250 barrels must plan for and identify maximum most probable discharge response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (3) The organization(s) identified to meet the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(v) of this section must be capable of providing the equipment and supplies necessary to meet the requirements of §§ 155.5050 and 155.5052, as appropriate, and sources of trained personnel to continue operation of the equipment and staff the OSRO(s) and spill management team identified for the first 7 days of the response.

        (4) The GSA must list the response resources and related information required under §§ 155.5050, 155.5052, and appendix B of this part, as appropriate.

        (5) If the Coast Guard has evaluated an OSRO and has determined the OSROs capability is equal to or exceeds the response capability needed by the vessel, the GSA may identify only the OSRO and their applicable classification and not the information required in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. This information is subject to Coast Guard verification at any time during the validity of the VRP.

        (6) The GSA must also separately list the companies identified to provide the salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting resources required in this subpart. The GSA must list the response resources and related information required in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. This information is subject to Coast Guard verification at any time during the validity of the VRP.

        (i) Nontank vessels with a capacity less than 2,500 barrels, but greater than or equal to 250 barrels, need only plan for and identify salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting response resources, as required by subpart I, in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (ii) Nontank vessels with a capacity less than 250 barrels need only plan for and identify salvage response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (7) For nontank vessels with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater that carry group II through group IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo and that operate in waters where dispersant use pre-authorization agreements exist, the GSA must also separately list the resource providers and specific resources, including appropriately trained dispersant-application personnel, necessary to provide, if appropriate, the dispersant capabilities required in this subpart. All resource providers and resources must be available by contract or other approved means. The dispersant resources to be listed within this section must include the following—

        (i) Identification of each primary dispersant staging site to be used by each dispersant-application platform to meet the requirements of § 155.5050(j) of this chapter; and

        (ii) Identification of the platform type, resource provider, location, and dispersant payload for each dispersant-application platform identified. Location data must identify the distance between the platform's home base and the identified primary dispersant-staging site(s) for this section.

        (8) For each unit of dispersant stockpile required to support the effective daily application capacity of each dispersant-application platform necessary to sustain each intended response tier of operation, identify the dispersant product resource provider, location, and volume. Location data must include the distance from the stockpile to the primary staging sites where the stockpile would be loaded on to the corresponding platforms. If the Coast Guard has evaluated an OSRO and has determined its capability meets the response capability needed by the vessel owner or operator, the section may identify the OSRO only, and not the information required in paragraphs (i)(7)(i), (i)(7)(ii), and (i)(8) of this section.

        (9) Nontank vessels with an oil capacity of 250 barrels or greater, but less than 2,500 barrels, that carry group II through group IV petroleum oils as fuel or cargo and that operate in waters where dispersant use pre-authorization agreements exist, need only plan for and identify dispersant response resources but not ensure their availability by contract. Submission of a written consent from the dispersant response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (10) For nontank vessels with a fuel and cargo capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater not operating exclusively on the inland areas of the United States, the GSA must also separately list the resource providers and specific resources necessary to provide oil spill tracking capabilities required in this subpart. The oil spill tracking resources to be listed within this section must include the following—

        (i) The identification of a resource provider; and

        (ii) The type and location of aerial surveillance aircraft that have been ensured available, through contract or other approved means, to meet the oil spill tracking requirements of § 155.1050(k) of this part.

        (11) Nontank vessels with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater, but less than 2,500 barrels, need only plan for and identify aerial oil spill tracking response resources in the VRP, but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, “Contract or other approved means”, paragraph (5).

        (j)  This section of the VRP must include for each vessel covered by the VRP the following information, as applicable—

        (1) List of the vessel's principal characteristics;

        (2) Capacities of all cargo, fuel, lube oil, ballast, and fresh water tanks;

        (3) The total volume and groups of oil that would be involved in a—

        (b)  Captain of the Port (COTP) reclassification of a specific body of water or location within the COTP zone must be in accordance with 33 CFR 155.1050(b).

        (c)  Response equipment must—

        (1) Meet or exceed the criteria listed in Table 1 of appendix B of this part;

        (2) Be capable of functioning in the applicable operating environment; and

        (3) Be appropriate for the amount of oil capable of being carried.

        (d)  (1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel that carries groups I through IV petroleum oil as cargo must identify in the VRP and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources that will respond to a discharge up to the vessel's average most probable discharge (AMPD). Nontank vessels that carry oil as cargo must meet the requirements for AMPD coverage, as applicable, per 33 CFR 155.1050(d).

        (2) Nontank vessels that only carry groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel do not have to ensure the availability of AMPD resources by contract or other approved means, but must plan for and identify response resources required in § 155.1050(d)(1) and list this information in the applicable geographic-specific appendix for bunkering or fueling operations. Permission or acknowledgement from the listed resource providers is not required.

        (e)  (1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo must identify in the VRP and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources necessary to respond to a discharge up to the vessel's maximum most probable discharge (MMPD) volume. For the purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, vessel owners or operators must meet 33 CFR 155.1050(e).

        (2) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel with a capacity less than 250 barrels must plan for and identify MMPD response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (f)  The owner or operator of a nontank vessel with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo must identify in the VRP and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources necessary to respond to discharges up to the worst case discharge (WCD) volume of the oil to the maximum extent practicable. For the purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, vessel owners or operators must meet 33 CFR 155.1050(f). Nontank vessels need only plan for Tier 1 response resources.

        (g)  Response equipment identified to respond to a WCD should be capable of arriving on scene within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable response in a higher volume port area, Great Lakes, or in other areas. Table 155.5050(g) details response times for this tier, from the time of discovery of a discharge.

        (h)  For the purposes of arranging for MMPD or WCD response resources through contract or other approved means, response equipment identified for plan credit should be capable of being mobilized and en route to the scene of a discharge within 2 hours of notification. The notification procedures identified in the VRP should provide for notification and authorization for mobilization of response resources—

        (1) Either directly or through the qualified individual; and

        (2) Within 30 minutes of a discovery of a discharge or substantial threat of discharge.

        (i)  The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo must plan for salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting response resources, as applicable.

        (1) Nontank vessels with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater must meet the salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting requirements found in subpart I of this part.

        (2) Nontank vessels with a capacity less than 2,500 barrels, but greater than or equal to 250 barrels, need to plan for and identify salvage, emergency lightering, and marine firefighting response resources found in subpart I in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (3) Nontank vessels with a capacity less than 250 barrels need to plan for and identify salvage response resources found in subpart I in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (j)  (1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups II through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater that operates in any area pre-authorized for dispersant use must identify in their VRP, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, response resources capable of conducting dispersant operations within those areas. Vessel owners or operators must meet 33 CFR 155.1050(k). These nontank vessels must meet Tier 1 for dispersant effective daily application capability.

        (2) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel with a capacity less than 2,500 barrels, but greater than or equal to 250 barrels, needs to plan for and identify dispersant response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, paragraph (5) of the definition of “Contract or other approved means.”

        (k)  (1) The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo with a capacity of—

        (i) 2,500 barrels or greater must identify in the VRP, and ensure availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources necessary to provide aerial oil spill tracking to support oil spill assessment and cleanup activities. Vessel owners or operators of these vessels must meet 33 CFR 155.1050(l).

        (ii) Less than 2,500 barrels, but greater than 250 barrels, need to plan for and identify aerial oil tracking response resources in the VRP but do not have to ensure these resources are available by contract. Submission of a written consent for plan listing from the recognized response resource provider must accompany the VRP for approval or revision. This is considered an acceptable “other approved means.” See 33 CFR 155.5020, “Contract or other approved means”, paragraph (5).

        (2) Nontank vessels operating exclusively on the inland areas of the United States are not required to comply with paragraph (k) of this section.

        (l)  The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater must identify in the VRP, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the response resources necessary to perform shoreline protection operations. The response resources must include the quantities of boom listed in Table 2 of appendix B of this part, based upon the specific COTP zones in which the vessel operates.

        (m)  The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo with a capacity of 250 barrels or greater must identify in the VRP, and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, an oil spill removal organization capable of effecting a shoreline cleanup operation commensurate with the quantity of emulsified petroleum oil to be planned for in shoreline cleanup operations. The shoreline cleanup resources required must be determined as described in appendix B of this part.

        (n)  Appendix B of this part sets out response capability capacities (caps) that recognize the practical and technical limits of response capabilities for which an individual vessel owner or operator can contract in advance. Table 6 in appendix B lists the contracting caps that are applicable. The owner or operator of a nontank vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as fuel or cargo, with a capacity of 2,500 barrels or greater, whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 6, must identify commercial sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed for each tier or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower, to the extent that this equipment is available. The equipment so identified must be capable of arriving on scene no later than the applicable tier response times contained in § 155.5050(g) or as quickly as the nearest available resource permits. A VRP must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of this additional equipment. No contract is required.

        (o)  The Coast Guard will continue to evaluate the environmental benefits, cost efficiency, and practicality of increasing mechanical recovery capability requirements. This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a rulemaking process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include, at least, an evaluation of—

        (1) Best available technologies for containment and recovery;

        (2) Oil spill tracking technology;

        (3) High rate response techniques;

        (4) Other applicable response technologies; and

        (5) Increases in the availability of private response resources.

        (p)  Table 155.5050(p) summarizes the VRP required response resources.

        § 157.09   Segregated ballast.

#### § § 157.09

        (a) A new vessel of 70,000 tons DWT or more must have segregated ballast tanks that have a total capacity to allow the vessel to meet the draft and trim requirements in paragraph (b) of this section without recourse to the use of oil tanks for water ballast.

        (b) In any ballast condition during any part of a voyage, including that of lightweight with only segregated ballast, the vessel's drafts and trim must have the capability of meeting each of the following requirements:

        (1) The molded draft amidship (dm) in meters without taking into account vessel deformation must not be less than dm in the following mathematical relationship:

        (2) The drafts at the forward and after perpendiculars must correspond to those determined by the draft amidship as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in association with the trim by the stern of no more than 0.015L.

        (3) The minimum allowable draft at the after perpendicular is that which is necessary to obtain full immersion of the propeller.

        (c) The vessel may be designed to carry ballast water in cargo tanks during the condition described in § 157.35.

        (d) Segregated ballast spaces, voids, and other noncargo-carrying spaces for a vessel of conventional form must be distributed:

        (1) So that the mathemati*c*al average of the hypothetical colli*s*ion (O) and the hypothetical stranding (O) outflows as determined by the application of the procedures in § 157.19 and appendix B is 80 percent or less of the maximum allowable outflow (O) as determined by § 157.19(b)(1); and

        (2) To prote*c*t *a*t lea*s*t 45 percent of the sum of the side and bottom shell areas, based upon projected molded dimensions, within the cargo tank length. When the vessel design configuration does not provide for the spaces to be distributed to protect at least 45 percent of the side and bottom shell areas, the spaces must be distributed so that the mathematical average of the hypothetical collision (O) and the hypothetical stranding (O) outflows, determined by application of the procedures in § 157.19 and appendix B, is a further 2 percent less than the maximum allowable outflow (O) for each 1 percent by which the shell area protection coverage required is not achieved.

        (e) A ballast space, void or other non-cargo-carrying space used to meet requirements in paragraph (d) of this section must separate the cargo tank boundaries from the shell plating of the vessel by at least 2 meters.

        (f) A vessel of conventional form for application of this section has:

        (1) A block coefficient of .80 or greater,

        (2) A length to depth ratio between 12 and 16, and

        (3) A breadth to depth ratio between 1.5 and 3.5.

        (g) Segregated ballast spaces, voids, and other noncargo-carrying spaces for a vessel not of conventional form must be distributed in a configuration acceptable to the Coast Guard.

        § 157.12d   Technical specifications.

#### § § 157.12d

        (a)  (1) The monitoring system must be capable of effectively monitoring and controlling the discharge of any effluent into the sea through those overboard discharge outlets permitted by § 157.11 that are necessary to fulfill the operational requirements of the oil tanker.

        (2) The discharge of dirty ballast water or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas into the sea through outlets, which are not controlled by the monitoring system is prohibited.

        (3) The monitoring system must function effectively under all environmental conditions normally encountered by oil tankers, and must be designed and constructed to satisfy the specifications for approval in 46 CFR subpart 162.050. Moreover—

        (i) The system must be designed so a discharge of dirty-ballast or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas cannot take place unless the monitoring system is in the normal operating mode and the relevant sampling point has been selected;

        (ii) The system should sample the effluent discharge from a minimum number of discharge outlets and be arranged so that discharge overboard can take place via only one outlet at a time;

        (iii) Where it is intended that more than one line be used for simultaneous discharging purposes, one oil content meter, together with a flow meter, must be installed in each discharge line. These instruments must be connected to a common processor; and

        (iv) To avoid alarms because of short-term high-oil-concentration signals (spikes) causing indications of high instantaneous rates of discharge, the short-term high ppm signal may be suppressed for a maximum of 10 seconds. Alternatively, the instantaneous rate of discharge may be continuously averaged during the preceding 20 seconds or less as computed from instantaneous ppm values of the oil content meter readings received at intervals not exceeding 5 seconds.

        (4) The monitoring system must comprise—

        (i) An oil content meter to measure the oil content of the effluent in ppm. The meter must be approved in accordance with the provisions contained in 46 CFR subpart 162.050 and certified to take into account the range of cargoes carried;

        (ii) A flow rate indicating system to measure the rate of effluent being discharged into the sea;

        (iii) A ship speed indicating device to give the ship's speed in knots;

        (iv) A ship position indicating device to give the ship's position-latitude and longitude;

        (v) A sampling system to convey a representative sample of the effluent to the oil content meter;

        (vi) An overboard discharge control to stop the overboard discharge;

        (vii) A starting interlock to prevent the discharge overboard of any effluent unless the monitoring system is fully operational; and

        (viii) A control section comprising—

        (A) A processor that accepts signals of oil content in the effluent, the effluent flow rate, and the ship's speed, and computes these values into liters of oil discharged per nautical mile and the total quantity of oil discharged;

        (B) A means to provide alarms and command signals to the overboard discharge control;

        (C) A recording device to provide a record of data required under § 157.12d(h)(2);

        (D) A data display to exhibit the current operational data required under § 157.12d(i);

        (E) A manual override system to be used in the event of failure of the monitoring system;

        (F) A means to provide signals to the starting interlock to prevent the discharge of any effluent before the monitoring system is fully operational; and

        (G) The control section of the monitoring system must be tested in accordance with the vibration testing requirements described in 46 CFR 162.050-37.

        (5) Each main component of the monitoring system must be fitted with a name plate, properly identifying the component by assembly drawing number, type or model number, and serial number, as appropriate.

        (6) The electrical components of the monitoring system that are to be installed in an explosive atmosphere must be in compliance with 46 CFR 162.050-25.

        (7) Each main component of the monitoring system must be designed in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in subchapters F and J.

        (b)  (1) Sampling points must be located so relevant samples can be obtained from those outlets used for operational discharges in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The sampling probes located in the overboard discharge lines and the piping system connecting the sampling probes to the oil content meter must meet the requirements of this paragraph.

        (2) The piping and probes must be—

        (i) Of a material resistant to fire, corrosion, and oil; and

        (ii) Of adequate strength and properly jointed and supported.

        (3) The system must have a stop-valve fitted adjacent to each probe, except that, where the probe is mounted in a cargo line, two stop-valves must be fitted, in series, in the sample line. One of these may be the remote controlled sample selector valve.

        (4) Sampling probes must be arranged for easy withdrawal and must, as far as practicable, be mounted at an accessible location in a vertical section of the discharge line. Should it be necessary to fit sampling probes in a horizontal section of the discharge line it must be ascertained, during the installation survey, that the pipe runs full of liquid at all times during the discharge of the effluent. Sampling probes must normally penetrate inside the discharge pipe to a distance of one quarter the diameter of that pipe.

        (5) Means must be provided for cleaning the probes and piping system by the provision of permanent clean water flushing arrangements or an equivalent method. The design of the probes and piping must be such as to minimize their clogging by oil, oily residue, and other matter.

        (6) The velocity of the fluid in the piping must be such that, taking into consideration the length of the piping, the overall response time must be as short as possible between an alteration in the mixture being pumped and the alteration in the oil content meter reading. In no case should the response time, including the response time of the oil content meter, be more than 40 seconds.

        (7) The location of sampling probes in relation to any point of flow diversion to a slop tank must be selected with regard to the need for sampling the oily water in the recirculation mode.

        (8) The arrangements for driving the sampling pump or any other pumps used in the system must account for the safety requirements of the space in which the pump is located. Any bulkhead penetration between a hazardous and a non-hazardous area must be of a design meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 32.60-20 and 46 CFR subpart 111.105.

        (9) The flushing arrangement must be such that where necessary it can be utilized for test-running and stabilizing the oil content meter and correcting for zero setting.

        (10) Sample water returning to the slop tank must not be allowed to free-fall into the tank. In tankers equipped with an inert gas system, a water seal meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 32.53-10(b) must be arranged in the piping leading to a slop tank.

        (11) A valve must be provided for the manual collection of samples from the inlet piping to the oil content meter at a point downstream of any sampling pump.

        (c)  (1) A flow meter for measuring the rate of discharge must be installed in a vertical section of a discharge line or in any other section of a discharge line as appropriate, so as to be always filled with the liquid being discharged.

        (2) A flow meter must employ an operating principle which is suitable for shipboard use and, where relevant, can be used in large diameter pipes.

        (3) A flow meter must be suitable for the full range of flow rates that may be encountered during normal operation. Alternatively, arrangements such as the use of two flow meters of different ranges or a restriction of the operational flow rate range may be employed if necessary to meet this requirement.

        (4) The flow meter, as installed, must have an accuracy of ±10 percent, or better, of the instantaneous rate of discharge throughout the operating range for discharging the effluent.

        (5) Any component part of the flow meter in contact with the effluent should be of corrosion-resistant and oil-resistant material of adequate strength.

        (6) The design of the flow metering arrangements must account for the safety requirements of the space in which such metering arrangements are located.

        (d)  The automatic speed signal required for a monitoring system must be obtained from the ship's speed indicating device by means of a repeater signal. The speed information used may be either speed over the ground or speed through the water, depending upon the speed measuring equipment installed on board.

        (e)  The ship position indicating device must consist of a receiver for a global navigation satellite system, a terrestrial radio navigation system, or other means suitable for use at all times throughout the intended voyage to establish and update the ship's position by automatic means.

        (f)  The overboard discharge control must be able to stop the discharge of the effluent into the sea automatically by either closing all relevant overboard discharge valves or stopping all relevant pumps. The discharge control arrangement must be fail-safe so that all effluent discharge is stopped when the monitoring system is not in operation, at alarm conditions, or when the monitoring system fails to function.

        (g)  (1) The processor of a control section must receive signals from the oil content meter, the flow rate indicating system and the ship's speed indicating system at time intervals not exceeding 5 seconds and must automatically compute the following:

        (i) Instantaneous rate of discharge of oil in liters per nautical mile; and

        (ii) Total quantity of oil discharged during the voyage in cubic meters or liters.

        (2) When the limits imposed by § 157.37(a)(3) and (4) are exceeded, the processor must provide alarms and provide command signals to the overboard discharge control arrangement, which will cause the discharge of effluent into the sea to stop.

        (3) The processor must normally include a device for the continuous generation of time and date information. Alternative arrangements that ensure the automatic and continuous reception of time and date information from an external source may be approved by the Marine Safety Center.

        (4) In the event of power failure the processor must retain its memory in respect to computation of the total quantity of oil discharged, time, and date. A printout of data must be obtained when the monitoring system is operating with manual override, but the printout of data is not required if, when the power fails, the monitoring system activates the overboard discharge control to stop the discharge of effluent.

        (h)  (1) The recording device of a control section must include a digital printer, which may be formatted electronically. The recorded parameters must be explicitly identified on the printout. The printout must be legible and must remain so once removed from the recording device and must be retained for at least 3 years.

        (2) The data to be automatically recorded must include at least the following:

        (i) Instantaneous rate of discharge of oil (liters per nautical mile);

        (ii) Instantaneous oil content (ppm);

        (iii) The total quantity of oil discharged (cubic meters or liters);

        (iv) Time and date (GMT, Greenwich Mean Time);

        (v) Ship's speed in knots;

        (vi) Ship's position—latitude and longitude;

        (xii) Override action, including, but not limited to, manual override, flushing, and calibration. Any information inserted manually as a result of an override action must be identified as such on the printout.

        (3) Data required in paragraph (h)(2) of this section must be printed out or may be stored electronically with printout capability, with the following minimum frequency:

        (i) When the discharge is started;

        (ii) When the discharge is stopped;

        (iii) At intervals of not more than 10 minutes (except when the system is in stand-by mode);

        (iv) When an alarm condition develops;

        (v) When normal conditions are restored;

        (vi) Whenever the computed rate of discharge varies by 10 liters per nautical mile;

        (vii) When zero-setting or calibration modes are selected; and

        (viii) On manual command.

        (4) The recording device must be located in a position easily accessible to the person in charge of the overboard discharge operation.

        (i)  (1) In addition to the recorded printout, the current data must be visibly displayed and at a minimum contain the following:

        (i) Instantaneous rate of discharge of oil (liters per nautical mile);

      Subpart A—Vessel Traffic Services

        General Rules

          § 161.1   Purpose and Intent.

#### § § 161.1

          (a) The purpose of this part is to promulgate regulations implementing and enforcing certain sections of the 46 U.S.C. Chapter 700 “Ports and Waterways Safety setting up a national system of Vessel Traffic Services that will enhance navigation, vessel safety, and marine environmental protection, and promote safe vessel movement by reducing the potential for collisions, rammings, and groundings, and the loss of lives and property associated with these incidents within VTS areas established hereunder.

          (b) Vessel Traffic Services provide the mariner with information related to the safe navigation of a waterway. This information, coupled with the mariner's compliance with the provisions set forth in this part, enhances the safe routing of vessels through congested waterways or waterways of particular hazard. Under certain circumstances, a VTS may issue directions to control the movement of vessels in order to minimize the risk of collision between vessels, or damage to property or the environment.

          (c) The owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of a vessel remains at all times responsible for the manner in which the vessel is operated and maneuvered, and is responsible for the safe navigation of the vessel under all circumstances. Compliance with these rules or with a direction of the VTS is at all times contingent upon the exigencies of safe navigation.

          (d) Nothing in this part is intended to relieve any vessel, owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of a vessel from the consequences of any neglect to comply with this part or any other applicable law or regulation (e.g., the International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS) or the Inland Navigation Rules) or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

          § 161.2   Definitions.

#### § § 161.2

          For the purposes of this part:

          means a Vessel Traffic _Center_ or Vessel Movement Center.

          means the system of vessel traffic management established and jointly operated by the United States and Canada within adjoining waters. In addition, CVTS facilitates traffic movement and anchorages, avoids jurisdictional disputes, and renders assistance in emergencies in adjoining United States and Canadian waters.

          means any condition related to a vessel's ability to safely navigate or maneuver, and includes, but is not limited to:

          (1) The absence or malfunction of vessel operating equipment, such as propulsion machinery, steering gear, radar system, gyrocompass, depth sounding device, automatic radar plotting aid (ARPA), radiotelephone, Automatic Identification System equipment, navigational lighting, sound signaling devices or similar equipment.

          (2) Any condition on board the vessel likely to impair navigation, such as lack of current nautical charts and publications, personnel shortage, or similar condition.

          (3) Vessel characteristics that affect or restrict maneuverability, such as cargo or tow arrangement, trim, loaded condition, underkeel or overhead clearance, speed capabilities, power availability, or similar characteristics, which may affect the positive control or safe handling of the vessel or the tow.

          means all navigable waters of the United States including the territorial sea of the United States, extending to 12 nautical miles from United States baselines, as described in Presidential Proclamation No. 5928 of December 27, 1988.

          means a routing measure comprising an area within defined limits where vessels must navigate with particular caution and within which the direction of traffic may be recommended.

          means any commercial vessel engaged in towing another vessel astern, alongside, or by pushing ahead.

          means available in a widely-distributed and publicly available medium (e.g., VTS User's Manual, ferry schedule, Notice to Mariners).

          means the shore-based facility that operates the vessel tracking system for a Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) area or zone within such an area. The VMC does not necessarily have the capability or qualified personnel to interact with marine traffic, nor does it necessarily respond to traffic situations developing in the area, as does a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS).

          means a mandatory reporting system used to monitor and track vessel movements. This is accomplished by a vessel providing information under established procedures as set forth in this part in the areas defined in Table 161.12(c) (VTS and VMRS Centers, Call Signs/MMSI, Designated Frequencies, and Monitoring Areas).

          means a vessel, or an owner, operator, charterer, Master, or person directing the movement of a vessel that is required to participate in a VMRS.

          means the shore-based facility that operates the vessel traffic service for the Vessel Traffic Service area or zone within such an area.

          means a service implemented by the United States Coast Guard designed to improve the safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect the environment. The VTS has the capability to interact with marine traffic and respond to traffic situations developing in the VTS area.

          or  means the geographical area encompassing a specific VTS area of service. This area of service may be subdivided into zones for the purpose of allocating responsibility to individual Vessel Traffic Centers or to identify different operating requirements.

          means a waterway within a VTS area in which special operating requirements apply.

          means a vessel or an owner, operator, charterer, Master, or person directing the movement of a vessel within a VTS Area that is:

          (1) Subject to the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act;

          (2) Required to participate in a VMRS; or

          (3) Equipped with a required Coast Guard type-approved Automatic Identification System (AIS).

          means the manual established and distributed by the VTS to provide the mariner with a description of the services offered and rules in force for that VTS. Additionally, the manual may include chartlets showing the area and zone boundaries, general navigational information about the area, and procedures, radio frequencies, reporting provisions and other information which may assist the mariner while in the VTS area.

          § 161.5   Deviations from the rules.

#### § § 161.5

          (a) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part, either for an extended period of time or if anticipated before the start of a transit, must be submitted in writing to the appropriate District Commander. Upon receipt of the written request, the District Commander may authorize a deviation if it is determined that such a deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required measure or is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under the circumstances. An application for an authorized deviation must state the need and fully describe the proposed alternative to the required measure.

          (b) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part due to circumstances that develop during a transit or immediately preceding a transit may be made to the appropriate VTC. Requests to deviate must be made as far in advance as practicable. Upon receipt of the request, the VTC may authorize a deviation if it is determined that, based on vessel handling characteristics, traffic density, radar contacts, environmental conditions and other relevant information, such a deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required measure or is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under the circumstances.

      (a)  The regulations in this section are applicable to that part of the inland waterway from Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Del. and Md., between Reedy Point, Delaware River, and Old Town Point Wharf, Elk River.

      (b)  No vessel in the waterway shall be raced or crowded alongside another vessel. Vessels of all types, including pleasure craft, are required to travel at all times at a safe speed throughout the canal and its approaches so as to avoid damage by suction or wave wash to wharves, landings, riprap protection, or other boats, or injury to persons. Pilots and vessel operators transiting the canal and its approaches are warned that violation of this rule may result in having their privilege to transit the canal suspended. Passages of vessels through the canal will be monitored and specific cases will be investigated where damage by suction or wave wash does occur. Owners and operators of yachts, motorboats, rowboats and other craft are cautioned that large deep draft ocean-going vessels and other large commercial vessels ply the canal, and such owners and operators should be particularly careful to moor or anchor well away from the main ship channels, with moorings and lines which are sufficient and proper.

      (c)  All vessels proceeding with the current shall have the right-of-way over those proceeding against the current. Large vessels or tows must not overtake and attempt to pass other large vessels or tows in the waterway. All small pleasure craft shall relinquish the right-of-way to deeper draft vessels, which have a limited maneuvering ability due to their draft and size.

      (d)  Vessels will not be permitted to stop or anchor in the ship channel.

      (e)  Water skiing in the waterway is prohibited between Reedy Point and Welch Point.

      (f)  Transiting the canal by vessels under sail is not permitted between Reedy Point and Welch Point.

      § 162.65   All waterways tributary to the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay and all waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico east and south of St. Marks, Fla.

#### § § 162.65

      (a)  This section applies to the following:

      (1)  All navigable waters of the United States, natural or artificial, including bays, lakes, sounds, rivers, creeks, intracoastal waterways, as well as canals and channels of all types, which are tributary to or connected by other waterways with the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay or with the Gulf of Mexico east and south of St. Marks, Florida.

      (2)  All river and harbor lands owned by the United States in or along the waterways described in paragraph (a)(1) of this paragraph, including lock sites and all structures thereon, other sites for Government structures and for the accommodation and use of employees of the United States, and rights of way and spoil disposal areas to the extent of Federal interest therein.

      (3)  The term “vessel” as used in this section includes all floating things moved over these waterways other than rafts.

      (b) 1)  A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and rafts that normally use the various waterways or sections thereof. The District Commander may specify the width of the fairway required in the various waterways under his charge.

      (2)  (i) No vessels or rafts shall anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts of the waterway, except in case of an emergency. Whenever it becomes necessary for a vessel or raft to stop in any such portions of the waterway it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or craft. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.

      (ii) No vessel or raft will be allowed to use any portion of the fairway as a mooring place except temporarily as authorized above without the written permission from the District Commander.

      (iii) When tied up, all vessels must be moored by bow and stern lines. Rafts and tows shall be secured at sufficiently close intervals to insure their not being drawn away from the bank by winds, currents or the suction of passing vessels. Tow lines shall be shortened so that the different parts of the tow shall be as close together as possible. In narrow sections, no vessel or raft shall be tied abreast of another.

      (iv) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E).

      (v) No vessel, even if fastened to the bank as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, shall be left without a sufficient crew to care for it properly.

      (vi) Vessels will not be permitted to load or unload in any of the land cuts except as a regular established landing or wharf without written permission secured in advance from the District Commander.

      (vii) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged channel or narrow portion of a waterway for the purpose of fishing, if navigation is obstructed, thereby.

      (viii) Except in cases of emergency the dropping of anchors, weights, or other ground tackle, within areas occupied by submarine cable or pipe crossings, is prohibited. Such crossings will ordinarily be marked by signboards on each bank of the shore or indicated on coast charts.

      (3)  (i) Vessels shall proceed at a speed which will not endanger other vessels or structures and will not interfere with any work in progress incident to maintaining, improving, surveying or marking the channel.

      (ii) Official signs indicating limiting speeds through critical portions of the waterways shall be strictly obeyed.

      (iii) Vessels approaching and passing through a bridge shall so govern their speed as to insure passage through the bridge without damage to the bridge or its fenders.

      (4)  (i) All vessels drawing tows and equipped with rudders shall use two tow lines or a bridle and shorten them to the greatest possible extent so as to have full control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as short as practicable. If necessary, as in the case of lengthy or cumbersome tows or tows in restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be broken up and may require the installation of a rudder, drag or other approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of others, including aids to navigation maintained by the United States or under its authorization, by collision or otherwise.

      (ii) No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.

      (iii) Tows desiring to pass a bridge shall approach the opening along the axis of the channel so as to pass through without danger of striking the bridge or its fenders. No vessel or tow shall navigate through a drawbridge until the movable span is fully opened.

      (iv) In the event that it is evident to the master of a towing vessel that a tow cannot be safely handled through a bridge, it will be brought to anchor and the towed vessels will be taken through the bridge in small units, or singly if necessary, or the tow will wait until navigation conditions have improved to such an extent that the tow can pass through the bridge without damage.

      (5)  No vessel carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side of said vessel, or whose rigging projects over the side of the vessel so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves or other property, will enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway.

      (6)  Vessels, on meeting or overtaking, shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E). Rafts shall give to vessels the side demanded by proper signal. All vessels approaching dredges or other plant engaged on improvements to a waterway, shall give the signal for passing and slow down sufficiently to stop if so ordered or if no answering signal is received. On receiving the answering signal, they shall then proceed to pass at a speed sufficiently slow to insure safe navigation.

Whenever it becomes necessary for a vessel or tow to stop in any such portions of the waterway, it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or tows. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.

      (ii) When tied up individually, all vessels and tows shall be moored by bow and stern lines. Tows shall be secured at sufficiently frequent intervals to insure their not being drawn away form the bank by winds, currents, or the suction of passing vessels. Lines shall be shortened so that the various barges in a tow will be as close together as possible.

      (iii) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E).

      (iv) Whenever any vessel or tow is moored to the bank (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) at least one crew member shall always remain on board to see that proper signals are displayed and that the vessel or tow is properly moored at all times.

      (v) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged channel or narrow portion of a waterway for the purpose of fishing if navigation is obstructed thereby.

      (4) Speed: Speeding in narrow sections is prohibited. Official signs indicating limited speeds shall be obeyed. Vessels shall reduce speed sufficiently to prevent damage when passing other vessels or structures in or along the waterway.

      (5) Size, assembly, and handling of tows:

      (i) On waterways 150 feet wide or less, tows which are longer than 1,180 feet, including the towing vessel, but excluding the length of the hawser, or wider than one-half of the bottom width of the channel or 55 feet, whichever is less will not be allowed, except when the District Commander has given special permission or the waterway has been exempted from these restrictions by the District Commander. Before entering any narrow section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, tows in excess of one-half the channel width, or 55 feet, will be required to stand by until tows which are less than one-half the channel width or 55 feet wide have cleared the channel. When passing is necessary in narrow channels, overwidth tows shall yield to the maximum. Separate permission must be received from the District Commander for each overlength or overwidth movement. In addition, the following exceptions are allowed:

      (ii) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway—Between mile 6.2 EHL (Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock) and mile 33.6 EHL tows of 78 feet in width will be allowed.

      (iii) Gulf Intercoastal Waterway—Between mile 33.6 EHL and the Mobile Bay Ship Channel, tows of 108 feet in width will be allowed if under 750 feet in length including the towboat but excluding the length of the hawser.

      (iv) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway—Mobile Bay Ship Channel to St. Marks, Fla., for tows made up of empty barges on the off or shallow side, a width of 75 feet will be allowed.

      (v) All vessels pulling tows not equipped with rudders in restricted channels and land cuts shall use two towlines, or a bridle on one towline, shortened as much as safety of the towing vessel permits, so as to have maximum control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as short as practicable. In open water, the towlines and fastenings between barges may be lengthened so as to accommodate the wave surge. In the case of lengthy or cumbersome tows, or tows in restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be broken up, and may require the installation of a rudder or other approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of others. Pushing barges with towing vessel astern, towing barges with towing vessel alongside, or pushing and pulling barges with units of the tow made up both ahead and astern of the towing vessel are permissible provided that adequate power is employed to keep the tows under full control at all times. No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.

      (vi) All tows navigating the Pass Manchac bridges in Louisiana are limited to no more than two barges, not to exceed a combined tow length of 400 feet (excluding the towboat). Vessel operators for tows exceeding these limits must request and receive permission from the COTP New Orleans prior to navigating the bridges. Requests should be made by telephoning the COTP at 504-365-2200 or 504-365-2545. Any decision made by the COTP is final agency action.

      (6) Projections from vessels: Vessels or tows carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects over the side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other property, shall not enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway without prior approval of the District Commander.

      (7) Meeting and passing: Passing vessels shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E), where applicable. At certain intersections where strong currents may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued through navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the intersections.

#### § § 162.80

      (a)  (1) No vessel or craft shall moor along either bank of the Mississippi River between miles 311.5 AHP and mile 340.0 AHP except in case of an emergency, pursuant to an approved navigation permit, or as authorized by the District Commander. Vessels may be moored any place outside the navigation channel in this reach in case of an emergency and then for only the minimum time required to terminate the emergency. When so moored, all vessels shall be securely tied with bow and stern lines of sufficient strength and fastenings to withstand currents, winds, wave action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which might cause the vessels to break their moorings. When vessels are so moored, a guard shall be on board at all times to ensure that proper signals are displayed and that the vessels are securely and adequately moored.

      (2) Vessels may be moored any time at facilities constructed in accordance with an approved navigation permit or as authorized by the District Commander. When so moored, each vessel shall have sufficient fastenings to prevent the vessels from breaking loose by wind, current, wave action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which might cause the vessel to break its mooring. The number of vessels in one fleet and the width of the fleet of vessels tied abreast shall not extend into the fairway or be greater than allowed under the permit.

      (3) Mariners should report immediately by radio or fastest available means to the lockmaster at Old River Lock or to any government patrol or survey boat in the vicinity any emergency mooring or vessels drifting uncontrolled within the area described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It is the responsibility and duty of the master of a towing vessel releasing or mooring a vessel in this reach of the Mississippi River to report such action immediately.

      (b)  (1) When tied up individually or in fleets, vessels shall be moored with sufficient lines and shore fastenings to insure their remaining in place and withstanding the action of winds, currents and the suction of passing vessels.

      (1)  White River between Mississippi River and Arkansas Post Canal, Ark.; Arkansas Post Canal, Ark.; Arkansas River between Arkansas Post Canal, Ark., and Verdigris River, Okla.; Verdigris River between Arkansas River and Catoosa, Okla.; and reservoirs on these waterways between Mississippi River Ark., and Catoosa, Okla.

      (2)  All bridges, wharves, and other structures in or over the waterways described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (3)  The term “vessels” as used in this section includes every description of watercraft used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water, other than rafts.

      (b) Waterways:

      (1)  A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and rafts that normally use the various waterways or sections thereof. The District Commander may specify the width of the fairway required in the waterways under his charge.

      (2)  (i) No vessels or rafts shall anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts of the waterway, except in an emergency. Whenever it becomes necessary for a vessel or raft to stop in any such portions of the waterway, it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or rafts. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.

      (ii) Except temporarily, as authorized in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, no vessel or raft will be allowed to use any portion of the fairway as a mooring place without written permission from the District Commander.

      (iii) When tied up individually, all vessels shall be moored by bow and stern lines. Rafts and tows shall be secured at sufficiently close intervals to insure their not being drawn away from the bank by winds, currents, or the suction of passing vessels. Towlines shall be shortened so that the different parts of the tow will be as close together as possible. In narrow sections, no vessel or raft shall be tied abreast of another if the combined width of vessels or rafts is greater than 70 feet.

      (iv) When a vessel is moored under an emergency condition, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, at least one crew member shall remain in attendance to display proper lights and signals and tend the mooring lines. The crew member shall be provided with an adequate means of communication or signalling a warning in the event that, for any reason, the vessel or tow should go adrift. Immediately after completion of the emergency mooring, the lockmaster of the first lock downstream shall be notified of the character and cargo of the vessel and the location of such mooring.

      (v) Vessels will not be permitted to load or unload in any of the land cuts, except at a regular established landing or wharf, without written permission secured in advance from the District Commander.

      (vi) Except in an emergency, no vessel or raft shall anchor over revetted banks of the waterway, nor shall any type vessel except launches and other small craft land against banks protected by revetment except at regular commercial landings.

      (3)  (i) Excessive speed in narrow sections is prohibited. Official signs indicating limiting speeds through critical sections shall be strictly obeyed.

      (ii) When approaching and passing through a bridge, all vessels and rafts, regardless of size, shall control their speed so as to insure that no damage will be done to the bridge or its fenders.

      (iii) Within the last mile of approach to unattended, normally open automatic, movable span bridges, the factor of river flow velocity, of vessel (and tow) velocity, and of vessel power and crew capability are never to be permitted to result in a condition whereby the movement of vessel (and tow) cannot be completely halted or reversed within a 3-minute period.

      (iv) A vessel shall reduce its speed sufficiently to prevent any damage when approaching another vessel in motion or tied up, a wharf or other structure, works under construction, plant engaged in river and harbor improvement, levees withstanding floodwaters, buildings submerged or partially submerged by high waters, or any other manner of structure or improvements likely to be damaged by collision, suction, or wave action.

      (4)  (i) All vessels drawing tows not equipped with rudders in restricted channels and land cuts shall use two towlines, or a bridle on one towline, shortened to the greatest possible extent so as to have maximum control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as short as practicable. In open water, the towlines and fastenings between barges may be lengthened so as to accommodate the wave surge. In the case of length or cumbersome tows, or tows in restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be broken up, and may require the installation of a rudder or other approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of others. Pushing barges with towing vessel astern, towing barges with towing vessel alongside, or pushing and pulling barges with units of the tow made up both ahead and astern of the towing vessel is permissible provided that adequate power is employed to keep the tow under full control at all times.

      (ii) No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.

      (iii) No vessel or tow shall navigate through a drawbridge until the movable span is fully opened.

      (5)  No vessels carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects over the side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other property, shall enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway.

      (6)  Vessels on meeting or overtaking shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E). Rafts shall give to vessels the side demanded by proper signal. All vessels approaching dredges or other plant engaged on improvements to a waterway shall give the signal for passing and slow down sufficiently to stop if so ordered or if no answering signal is received. On receiving the answering signal, they shall then pass at a speed sufficiently slow to insure safe navigation. Vessels approaching an intersection or bend where the view is obstructed must exercise due caution. At certain intersections where strong currents may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued from time to time through navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the intersections which must be observed.

      § 162.205   Suisun Bay, San Joaquin River, Sacramento River, and connecting waters, CA.

#### § § 162.205

      (a) —(1)  The maximum speed for all ocean-going craft shall not exceed 10 miles per hour above the lower end of New York Slough, seven miles per hour above Criminal Point, or five miles per hour while passing any wharf, dock, or moored craft. As used in this paragraph, the speed of a vessel when navigating with the current shall be its rate of movement in excess of the velocity of the current.

      (2)  All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., in motion, moored or anchored, shall slow down and take every necessary precaution to avoid damage.

      (3)  (i) United States dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats, and similar plant of contractors executing river and harbor improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the regulations contained in part 83 of this chapter shall have the right of way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, whether Federal or contractors' plant, working the channel must however, take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided. Ocean-going vessels may show at the masthead a black ball not more than 20 inches in diameter as a signal to the dredge, and may also blow five long blasts of the whistle when within reasonable hearing distance of the dredge, such signal to be followed at the proper time by the passing signal described in the local pilot rules. The dredge shall promptly acknowledge both signals in the usual manner.

      (ii) Light-draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-going vessels, shall give the right of way to such vessels by making use of the shallower portions of the waterway.

      (iii) Rafts and tows must promptly give the channel side demanded upon proper signal by a vessel, and must be handled in such a manner as not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.

      (4)  (i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel or turning basin must, if still afloat and in a condition making anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall be temporarily beached on the northwest side of Mandeville Island or in the Old River.

      (ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.

      (5)  In no case following accidents of fire or collision will a vessel be allowed to remain either anchored or grounded in the channel, or beached at any place where it endangers other vessels, while settlement is pending with the underwriters.

      (6)  In all other respects, the existing Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the United States will govern in this channel.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  When going against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall not exceed 8 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the water shall not exceed 10 knots.

      (ii)  When going against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall not exceed 5 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the water shall not exceed 7 knots.

      (iii)  Within 550 feet of the centerline of the channel the speed shall be the minimum required to maintain steerageway; wind, tide, current, etc., being taken into consideration.

      (iv)  All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., underway, moored or anchored, shall take every necessary precaution to avoid damage.

      (v)  When passing another vessel (underway, anchored, or tied up); a wharf or other structure; work under construction; plant engaged in river and harbor improvement; levees withstanding flood waters; buildings partially or wholly submerged by high water; or any other structure liable to damage by collision, suction or wave action; vessels shall give as much leeway as circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude causing damage to the vessel or structure being passed. As deemed necessary for public safety during high river stages, floods, or other emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe, by navigation bulletins or other means, the limiting speed in knots or temporarily close the waterway or any reach of it to traffic. Since this subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict observance and full compliance herewith.

      (2)  (i) Dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats and other similar equipment, executing river and harbor improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the regulations contained in part 83 of this chapter, shall have the right-of-way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, whether Federal or contractor's plant, working the channel must however, take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided.

      (ii) Vessels intending to pass dredges or other types of floating plant working in navigable channels, when within a reasonable distance therefrom and not in any case over a mile, shall indicate such intention by one long blast of the whistle, and shall be directed to the proper side for passage by the sounding, by the dredge or other floating plant, of the signal prescribed in the inland pilot rules for vessels underway and approaching each other from opposite directions, which shall be answered in the usual manner by the approaching vessel. If the channel is not clear, the floating plant shall sound the alarm or danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further signal from the plant.

      (iii) When the pipeline from a dredge crosses the channel in such a way that an approaching vessel cannot pass safely around the pipeline or dredge, there shall be sounded immediately from the dredge the alarm or danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further signal from the dredge. The pipeline shall then be opened and the channel cleared as soon as practicable; when the channel is clear for passage the dredge shall so indicate by sounding the usual passing signal as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The approaching vessel shall answer with a corresponding signal and pass promptly.

      (iv) When any pipeline or swinging dredge shall have given an approaching vessel or tow the signal that the channel is clear, the dredge shall straighten out within the cut for the passage of the vessel or tow.

      (v) Shallow draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-going vessels, shall give the right-of-way to such vessels by making use of the shallower portions of the waterway, wherever possible.

      (vi) Tows should promptly give the channel side requested by proper signal from a vessel, and should be handled in such a manner as not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.

      (3)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section no person shall willfully or carelessly obstruct the free navigation of the waterway, or delay any vessel having the right to use the waterway.

      (ii) No vessel shall anchor within the channel except in distress or under stress of weather. Any vessel so anchored shall be moved as quickly as possible to such anchorage as will leave the channel clear for the passage of vessels.

      (iii) Motorboats, sailboats, rowboats, and other small craft shall not anchor or drift in the regular ship channel except under stress of weather or in case of breakdown. Such craft shall be so operated that they will not interfere with or endanger the movement of commercial or public vessels.

      (4)  (i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel or turning basin, must if still afloat and in a condition making anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall be temporarily beached on the southwest side of Ryer Island from Mile 15.0 to Mile 16.3 or in the Harbor and Turning Basin at West Sacramento.

      (ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.

      (5)  Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other persons using the waterway to which this paragraph applies shall notify the District Commander and in the case of undocumented vessels, the State Division of Small Craft Harbors also, by the most expeditious means available of all marine accidents, such as fire, collision, sinking or stranding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel or interference with navigation or where damage to Government property is involved, furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and ownership of the vessel or vessels involved, the time and place, and the action taken. In all cases, the owner of the sunken vessel shall take immediate steps to mark the wreck properly.

      (6)  In all other respects, existing Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the United States will govern in this channel.

      (B) Flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk that is listed in 46 CFR 30.25-1, Table 30.25-1.

      (2)  Use of a Coast Guard type-approved AIS Class B device in lieu of an AIS Class A device is permissible on the following vessels if they are not subject to pilotage by other than the vessel Master or crew:

      (i) Fishing industry vessels;

      (ii) Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section that are certificated to carry less than 150 passengers and that—

      (A) Do not operate in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) or Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) area defined in Table 161.12(c) of § 161.12 of this chapter, and

      (B) Do not operate at speeds in excess of 14 knots; and

      (iii) Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section engaged in dredging operations.

      (c)  The following self-propelled vessels must comply with International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as amended, Chapter V, regulation 19.2.1.6 (Positioning System), 19.2.4 (AIS Class A), and 19.2.3.5 (Transmitting Heading Device) or 19.2.5.1 (Gyro Compass) as applicable (Incorporated by reference, see § 164.03):

The AIS should be returned to continuous operation as soon as the compromise has been mitigated or the security incident has passed. The time and reason for the silent period should be recorded in the ship's official log and reported to the nearest Captain of the Port or Vessel Traffic Center (VTC).

      (3) AIS safety-related text messaging must be conducted in English and solely to exchange or communicate pertinent navigation safety information (analogous to a SECURITE broadcast). Although not prohibited, AIS text messaging should not be relied upon as the primary means for broadcasting distress (MAYDAY) or urgent (PAN PAN) communications. (47 CFR 80.1109, Distress, urgency, and safety communications).

      (4) AIS application-specific messaging (ASM) is permissible, but is limited to applications adopted by the International Maritime Organization (such as IMO SN.1/Circ.289) or those denoted in the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities' (IALA) ASM Collection for use in the United States or Canada, and to no more than one ASM per minute.

      (e)  AIS is primarily intended for use by the Master or person in charge of the vessel, or by the person designated by the Master or person in charge to pilot or direct the movement of the vessel, who must maintain a periodic watch for AIS information.

      (f)  The use of a portable AIS is permissible only to the extent that electromagnetic interference does not affect the proper function of existing navigation and communication equipment on board and such that only one AIS device may be transmitting on board a vessel at any one time.

      (g)  The AIS Pilot Plug on any vessel subject to pilotage by other than the vessel Master or crew must be readily available and easily accessible from the primary conning position of the vessel and permanently affixed (not an extension cord) and adjacent (within 3 feet) to a 120-volt 50/60 Hz AC power receptacle (NEMA 5-15).

      (h)  The following vessels may seek up to a 5-year deviation from the AIS requirements of this section by requesting a deviation under § 164.55.

      (1) Vessels that operate solely within a very confined area (e.g., less than a 1 nautical-mile radius, shipyard, or barge fleeting facility);

      (2) Vessels that conduct only short voyages (less than 1 nautical mile) on a fixed schedule (e.g., a bank-to-bank river ferry service or a tender vessel);

      (3) Vessels that are not likely to encounter other AIS-equipped vessels;

      (4) Vessels whose design or construction makes it impracticable to operate an AIS device (e.g., those that lack electrical power, have an exposed or open cabin, or are submersible); or

      (5) Vessels denoted in paragraph (b)(2) that seek a deviation from requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e) of this section because their AIS Class B device lacks a display.

      (i)  Except for maritime support stations (see 47 CFR 80.5) licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), broadcasts from AIS Class A or B devices on aircraft, non-self propelled vessels or from land are prohibited.

      (j)  Those vessels identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that were not previously subject to AIS carriage must install AIS no later than March 1, 2016.

      (3) Does not fix the position of the vessel using buoys alone (Buoys are aids to navigation placed in approximate positions either to alert mariners to hazards to navigation or to indicate the orientation of a channel. They may not maintain exact charted positions, because strong or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with vessels can move or sink them or set them adrift. Although they may corroborate a position fixed by other means, they cannot fix a position; however, if no other aids are available, buoys alone may establish an estimated position.);

      (4) Evaluates the danger of each closing visual or radar contact;

      (5) Knows and applies the variation and deviation, where a magnetic compass is fitted and where charts or maps have enough detail to enable this type of correction;

      (6) Knows the speed and direction of the current, and the set, drift, and tidal state for the area to be transited;

      (7) Proceeds at a safe speed taking into account the weather, visibility, density of traffic, draft of tow, possibility of wake damage, speed and direction of the current, and local speed-limits; and

      (8) Monitors the voyage plan required by § 164.80.

      (b) The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing shall ensure that the tests and inspections required by § 164.80 are conducted and that the results are entered in the log or other record carried on board.

      § 164.80   Tests, inspections, and voyage planning.

#### § § 164.80

      (a) The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel of less than 1,600 GT shall ensure that the following tests and inspections of gear occur before the vessel embarks on a voyage of more than 24 hours or when each new master or operator assumes command:

      (1)  A test of the steering-gear-control system; a test of the main steering gear from the alternative power supply, if installed; a verification of the rudder-angle indicator relative to the actual position of the rudder; and a visual inspection of the steering gear and its linkage.

      (2)  A test of all installed navigational equipment.

      (3)  Operation of all internal vessel control communications and vessel-control alarms, if installed.

      (4)  Operation of all navigational lights and all searchlights.

      (1)  Tests of onboard equipment as required by § 164.25.

      (2)  Visual inspection of tackle; of connections of bridle and towing pendant, if applicable; of chafing gear; and of the winch brake, if installed.

      (c)(1) The voyage-planning requirements outlined in this section do not apply to you if your towing vessel is—

      (i) Used solely for any of the following services or any combination of these services—

      (A) Within a limited geographic area, such as a fleeting-area for barges or a commercial facility, and used for restricted service, such as making up or breaking up larger tows;

      (B) For harbor-assist;

      (C) For assistance towing as defined by 46 CFR 10.103;

      (D) For response to emergency or pollution;

      (ii) A public vessel that is both owned, or demise chartered, and operated by the United States Government or by a government of a foreign country; and that is not engaged in commercial service;

      (iii) A foreign vessel engaged in innocent passage; or

      (iv) Exempted by the Captain of the Port (COTP).

      (2) If you think your towing vessel should be exempt from these voyage planning requirements for a specified route, you should submit a written request to the appropriate COTP. The COTP will provide you with a written response granting or denying your request.

      (3) If any part of a towing vessel's intended voyage is seaward of the baseline ( the shoreward boundary) of the territorial sea of the U.S., then the owner, master, or operator of the vessel, employed to tow a barge or barges, must ensure that the voyage with the barge or barges is planned, taking into account all pertinent information before the vessel embarks on the voyage. The master must check the planned route for proximity to hazards before the voyage begins. During a voyage, if a decision is made to deviate substantially from the planned route, then the master or mate must plan the new route before deviating from the planned route. The voyage plan must follow company policy and consider the following (related requirements noted in parentheses):

      (i) Applicable information from nautical charts and publications (also see paragraph (b) of section 164.72), including Coast Pilot, Coast Guard Light List, and Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination;

      (ii) Current and forecast weather, including visibility, wind, and sea state for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination (also see paragraphs (a)(7) of section 164.78 and (b) of section 164.82);

      (iii) Data on tides and currents for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination, and the river stages and forecast, if appropriate;

      § 164.82   Maintenance, failure, and reporting.

#### § § 164.82

      (a)  The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel shall maintain operative the navigational-safety equipment required by § 164.72.

      (b)  If any of the navigational-safety equipment required by § 164.72 fails during a voyage, the owner, master, or operator of the towing vessel shall exercise due diligence to repair it at the earliest practicable time. He or she shall enter its failure in the log or other record carried on board. The failure of equipment, in itself, does not constitute a violation of this rule; nor does it constitute unseaworthiness; nor does it obligate an owner, master, or operator to moor or anchor the vessel. However, the owner, master, or operator shall consider the state of the equipment—along with such factors as weather, visibility, traffic, and the dictates of good seamanship—in deciding whether it is safe for the vessel to proceed.

      (c)  The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel whose equipment is inoperative or otherwise impaired while the vessel is operating within a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Area shall report the fact as required by 33 CFR Table 161.18(a) row Q.

      (d)  The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel unable to repair within 96 hours an inoperative marine radar required by § 164.72(a) shall so notify the Captain of the Port (COTP) and shall seek from the COTP both a deviation from the requirements of this section and an authorization for continued operation in the area to be transited. Failure of redundant navigational-safety equipment, including but not limited to failure of one of two installed radars, where each satisfies § 164.72(a), does not necessitate either a deviation or an authorization.

      (1) The initial notice and request for a deviation and an authorization may be spoken, but the request must also be written. The written request must explain why immediate repair is impracticable, and state when and by whom the repair will be made.

      (2) The COTP, upon receiving even a spoken request, may grant a deviation and an authorization from any of the provisions of §§ 164.70 through 164.82 for a specified time if he or she decides that they would not impair the safe navigation of the vessel under anticipated conditions.

          (b)  As used in this section—

          means a Coast Guard Patrol Commander, including a Coast Guard coxswain, petty officer, or other officer operating a Coast Guard vessel and a Federal, State, and local officer designated by or assisting the Captain of the Port Delaware Bay (COTP) in the enforcement of the security zone.

          means any person for whom the United States Secret Service requests implementation of a security zone in order to supplement protection of said person(s).

          means any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, State, or local law enforcement vessel assigned or approved by the COTP.

          (c)  (1) In accordance with the general regulations contained in §  165.33 of this part, entry into or movement within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the COTP, Sector Delaware Bay, or designated representative.

          (2) Entry into or remaining in a security zone described in paragraph (a) of this section is prohibited unless authorized by the COTP or designated representative when the security zones are being enforced. At the start of each enforcement, all persons and vessels within the security zone must depart the zones immediately or obtain authorization from the COTP or designated representative to remain within either zone. All vessels authorized to remain in the zone(s) must proceed as directed by the COTP or designated representative.

          (3) A person or vessel operator who intends to enter or transit the security zones while the zones are being enforced must obtain authorization from the COTP or designated representative. While the zones are being enforced the COTP or designated representative will determine access to the zones on a case-by-case basis. A person or vessel operator requesting permission to enter or transit the security zone may contact the COTP or designated representative at 215-271-4807 or on marine band radio VHF-FM channel 16 (156.8 MHz), or by visually or verbally hailing the on-scene law enforcement vessel enforcing the zone. On-scene Coast Guard personnel enforcing this section can be contacted on marine band radio, VHF-FM channel 16 (156.8 MHz). The operator of a vessel must proceed as directed upon being hailed by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel, or other Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency vessel, by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means. When authorized by the COTP or designated representative to enter the security zone all persons and vessels must comply with the instructions of the COTP or designated representative and proceed at the minimum speed necessary to maintain a safe course while within the security zone.

          (4) Upon being hailed by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel, or other Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency vessel, by siren, radio, flashing light or other means, a person or operator of a vessel must proceed as directed. Failure to comply with lawful direction may result in expulsion from the regulated area, citation for failure to comply, or both.

          (5) Unless specifically authorized by on-scene enforcement vessels, no vessel or person will be permitted to stop or anchor in the security zone. A vessel granted permission to enter or transit within the security zone(s) must do so without delay or pause for the entirety of its time within the boundaries of the security zone(s). At times, for limited duration, it is anticipated that vessels may be prohibited from entering the zone due to movement of persons protected by USSS. During those times, the Coast Guard will provide actual notice to vessels in the area.

          (6) The U.S. Coast Guard may secure the entirety of either or both security zones if deemed necessary to address security threats or concerns.

          (7) The U.S. Coast Guard may be assisted by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in the patrol and enforcement of the security zone described in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (d)  (1) The Coast Guard activates the security zones when requested by the U.S. Secret Service for the protection of individuals who qualify for protection under 18 U.S.C 3056(a) or Presidential memorandum. The COTP will provide the public with notice of enforcement of security zone by Broadcast Notice to Mariners (BNM), information release at the website:  as well as on-scene notice by designated representative or other appropriate means in accordance with 33 CFR 165.7.

          (2) These security zones may be enforced individually or simultaneously.

This is a moving security zone when the escorted vessel is in transit and becomes a fixed zone when the escorted vessel is anchored or moored. A security zone will not extend beyond the boundary of the regulated area in this section.

          (d)  (1) The general regulations for security zones contained in § 165.33 of this part apply to this section.

          (2) A vessel may request the permission of the COTP Savannah or a designated representative to enter the security zone described in paragraph (c) of this section. If permitted to enter the security zone, a vessel must proceed at the minimum safe speed and must comply with the orders of the COTP or a designated representative. No vessel or person may enter the inner 50-yard portion of the security zone closest to the vessel.

          (e)  The COTP will inform the public of the existence or status of the security zones around escorted vessels in the regulated area by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Coast Guard assets or other Federal, State or local law enforcement agency assets will be clearly identified by lights, vessel markings, or with agency insignia. When escorted vessels are moored, dayboards or other visual indications such as lights or buoys may be used.

          (f)  The COTP Savannah may be reached via phone at (912) 652-4353. Any on scene Coast Guard or designated representative assets may be reached via VHF-FM channel 16.

          § 165.923   Regulated Navigation Area, Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Romeoville, IL.

#### § § 165.923

          (a)  (1) The following is a regulated navigation area (RNA): All waters of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Romeoville, IL located between mile marker 295.5 and mile marker 297.2.

          (2)(i) The general regulations contained in § 165.13 apply.

          (ii) Vessels that comply with the following restrictions are permitted to transit the RNA:

          (A) Vessels must be greater than 20 feet in length.

          (B) Vessels must not be a personal or human powered watercraft ( jet skis, waver runners, kayaks, row boats, etc.).

          (C) Vessels engaged in commercial service, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(5), may not pass (meet or overtake) in the RNA and must make a SECURITÉ call when approaching the RNA to announce intentions and work out passing arrangements.

          (D) Commercial tows transiting the RNA must use wire rope or appropriate alternatives to ensure electrical connectivity between all segments of the tow.

          (E) All vessels are prohibited from loitering in the RNA.

          (F) Vessels may enter the RNA for the sole purpose of transiting to the other side and must maintain headway throughout the transit. All vessels and persons are prohibited from dredging, laying cable, dragging, fishing, conducting salvage operations, or any other activity, which could disturb the bottom of the RNA.

          (G) Except for law enforcement and emergency response personnel, all personnel on vessels transiting the RNA should remain inside the cabin, or as inboard as practicable. If personnel must be on open decks, they must wear a Coast Guard approved personal flotation device.

          (H) Vessels may not moor or lay up on the right or left descending banks of the RNA.

          (I) Towboats may not make or break tows if any portion of the towboat or tow is located in the RNA.

          (J) Persons onboard any vessel transiting the RNA in accordance with this rule or otherwise are advised they do so at their own risk.

          (K) All vessels transiting the RNA are required to transit at a no wake speed but still maintain bare steerageway.

          (L)() All vessels are prohibited from transiting the restricted navigation area with any non-potable water on board if they intend to release that water in any form within, or on the other side of the restricted navigation area. Non-potable water includes, but is not limited to, any water taken on board to control or maintain trim, draft, stability, or stresses of the vessel. Likewise, it includes any water taken on board due to free communication between the hull of the vessel and exterior water. Potable water is water treated and stored aboard the vessel that is suitable for human consumption.

          () Vessels with non-potable water on board are permitted to transit the restricted navigation area if they have taken steps to prevent the release, in any form, of that water in or on the other side of the restricted navigation area. Alternatively, vessels with non-potable water on board are permitted to transit the restricted navigation area if they have plans to dispose of the water in a biologically sound manner.

          () Vessels with non-potable water aboard that intend to discharge on the other side of the restricted navigation area must contact the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander or his or her designated representatives prior to transit and obtain permission to transit and discharge. Examples of discharges that may be approved include plans to dispose of the water in a biologically sound manner or demonstrate through testing that the non-potable water does not contain potential live Silver or Asian carp, viable eggs, or gametes.

          () In accordance with the general regulations in § 165.23, entry into, transiting, or anchoring within this safety zone by vessels with non-potable water on board is prohibited unless authorized by the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander, his or her designated representatives, or an on-scene representative.

          () The Captain of the Port, Lake Michigan, may further designate an “on-scene” representative. The Captain of the Port, Lake Michigan, or the on-scene representative may be contacted via VHF-FM radio Channel 16 or through the Coast Guard Lake Michigan Command Center at (414) 747-7182.

          (b)  The following definitions apply to this section:

          means the Captain of the Port Lake Michigan and Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Unit Chicago.

          means any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer who has been designated by the Captain of the Port, Lake Michigan, to act on his or her behalf. The on-scene representative of the Captain of the Port, Lake Michigan, will be aboard a Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, or other designated vessel or will be onshore and will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM radio or loudhailer.

          means every description of watercraft of other artificial contrivance used, or capable or being used, as a means of transportation on water. This definition includes, but is not limited to, barges.

          (c)  All persons and vessels must comply with this section and any additional instructions or orders of the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander or his or her designated representatives. Any person on board any vessel transiting this RNA in accordance with this rule or otherwise does so at his or her own risk.

          (d)  For any vessel, the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander or his or her designated representatives may waive any of the requirements of this section, upon finding that operational conditions or other circumstances are such that application of this section is unnecessary or impractical for the purposes of vessel and mariner safety.

          (c)  (1) This regulation will be enforced at all times in Section G and the Wilson Cove section of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section. Mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section before entering either of those sections (paragraphs (a)(7) and (8)).

          (2) This regulation will be enforced in Sections A through F of the safety zone described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section except when the Coast Guard notifies the public that enforcement of the zone in specified sections is temporarily suspended. Mariners need not obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to enter a zone section in which enforcement is temporarily suspended. At all other times, mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) before entering any of those sections.

          (3) The COTP will provide notice of suspended enforcement by means appropriate to effect the widest publicity, including broadcast notice to mariners, publication in the local notice to mariners, and posting the schedule of restricted access periods by date, location and duration at

          (d)  (1) The general regulations governing safety zones found in 33 CFR 165.23 apply to the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (2) Mariners requesting permission to transit through any section of the zone may request authorization to do so from the Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) San Diego by either calling 619-545-4742 or establishing a VHF bridge to bridge radio connection on Channel 16. Immediately upon completing transit, the vessel operator must promptly notify the FACSFAC of safe passage through the safety zone. Failure to expeditiously notify FACSFAC of passage through the safety zone will result in a determination by the Navy that the vessel is still in the safety zone, thereby restricting the use of the area for naval operations. If the Navy determines that facilitating safe transit through the zone negatively impacts range operations, the Navy will cease this practice and enforce the safety zones in these two areas without exception.

          (3) All persons and vessels must comply with the instructions of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard Captain of the Port or the designated representative.

          (4) Upon being hailed by U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard patrol personnel by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means, the operator of a vessel must proceed as directed.

          (5) The U.S. Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol and enforcement of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section by the U.S. Navy and local law enforcement agencies.

          § 165.1195   Regulated Navigation Area; Humboldt Bay Bar Channel and Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, Humboldt Bay, California.

#### § § 165.1195

          (a)  The Regulated Navigation Area (RNA) includes all navigable waters of the Humboldt Bay Bar Channel and the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, Humboldt Bay, California.

          (b)  As used in this section—

          means the Captain of the Port as defined in Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1.01-30 and 3.55-20.

          means Coast Guard _Sector_/Air Station Humboldt Bay.

          means the Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay.

          means any of the materials or substances listed in 46 CFR 153.40.

          means the area described in the location section of this regulation.

          means oil of any kind or in any form, including but not limited to, petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.

          means Coast Guard _Station_ Humboldt Bay.

          means any vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue.

          (c)  These regulations apply to the owners and operators of tank vessels transporting oil or hazardous material as cargo within the Humboldt Bay Area.

          (d)  (1) In addition to the arrival and departure notification requirements listed in title 33 CFR, part 160, Ports and Waterways Safety—General, subpart C—Notifications of “Arrivals, Departures, Hazardous Conditions, and Certain Dangerous Cargoes”, the owner, master, agent or person in charge of a vessel to which this notice applies shall obtain permission to cross within four hours of crossing the Humboldt Bay Bar. Between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., notification/requests for permission can be made to Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16, or at (707) 443-2213. If between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., or if unable to reach the Station, notification/requests for permission can be made directly to Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113.

          (2) Permission for a bar crossing by vessels or towing vessels and their tows to which this regulation applies is dependent on environmental and safety factors, including but not limited to: Sea state, winds, visibility, size and type of vessel or tow, wave period, time of day/night, and tidal currents. The final decision to close the bar rests with Humboldt Bay Sector Commander or his designated representative. At a minimum, Humboldt Bay Bar Channel crossings by vessels subject to this advisory will generally not be permitted unless all of the following conditions exist: Proper permission to cross has been received, sea conditions at the bar are less than 6 feet, winds at the bar are less than 30 knots, the transit will take place during daylight hours, the vessel has only a single tow or no tow, the visibility at the bar is greater than 1,000 yards, and the vessel and tow are in proper operating condition.

          (3) If the bar is closed to vessels to which this regulation applies, waiver requests will be accepted within four hours of crossing the entrance channel. If the waiver request is made between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., the request should be made to Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16, or at (707) 443-2213. If between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., or if unable to reach the Station, the request can be made directly to Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113. Waiver requests must be made by the vessel master and must provide the following: A description of the proposed operation, the conditions for which the waiver is requested, the reasons for requesting the waiver, the reasons that the requester believes the proposed operation can be accomplished safely, and a callback phone number. The Station or Sector Watchstander receiving the request will brief the Officer in Charge of the Station who will then brief the Sector Commander. The authority to grant waivers rests with the Sector Commander or his designated representative.

          (4) In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)-(3) of this section, vessels transporting liquefied hazardous gases or compressed hazardous gases in bulk as cargo into or out of Humboldt Bay are required to be aided by two assist tugs. If the vessel carrying the gases is towed, the assist tug requirement is in addition to the towing tug. The assist tugs shall escort the vessel through its transit and must be stationed so as to provide immediate assistance in response to the loss of power or steering of the cargo vessel, its towing tug, or loss of control over the tow.

          (5) Vessels to which this regulation applies may be required by the Sector Commander or his designated representative to be escorted by a Coast Guard vessel during their transit. In addition, if a vessel master, agent, or pilot has concerns about the safety of a vessel's transit through the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, a Coast Guard escort may be requested. Requests for an escort should be directed to Station on VHF-FM channel 16 or at (707) 443-2213 between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., or to Sector on VHF-FM channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113 if between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.

          (e)  Acting as a representative of the Captain of the Port, the Humboldt Bay Sector Commander will enforce this regulation and has the authority to take steps necessary to ensure the safe transit of vessels in Humboldt Bay. The Sector Commander can enlist the aid and cooperation of any Federal, State, county, and municipal agency to assist in the enforcement of the regulation. All persons and vessels shall comply with the instructions of the Sector Commander or the designated on-scene patrol personnel. Patrol personnel comprise commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard onboard Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, local, State, and Federal law enforcement vessels.

          Upon being hailed by U.S. Coast Guard patrol personnel by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means, the operator of a vessel shall proceed as directed.

          (c)  A 500-yard security zone is established around each escorted vessel within the regulated area described in paragraph (b) of this section. This is a moving security zone when the escorted vessel is in transit and becomes a fixed zone when the escorted vessel is anchored or moored. A security zone will not extend beyond the boundary of the regulated area in this section.

          (d)  (1) The general regulations for security zones contained in § 165.33 apply to this section.

          (2) A vessel may request the permission of the COTP LALB or a designated representative to enter the security zone described in paragraph (c) of this section. If permitted to enter the security zone, a vessel must proceed at the minimum safe speed and must comply with the orders of the COTP or a designated representative.

          (e)  The COTP will inform the public of the existence or status of the security zones around escorted vessels in the regulated area by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Coast Guard assets or other Federal, State or local law enforcement agency assets will be clearly identified by lights, vessel markings, or with agency insignia. When escorted vessels are moored, dayboards or other visual indications such as lights or buoys may be used.

          (f)  The COTP LALB may be reached via phone at (310) 521-3801. Any on scene Coast Guard or designated representative assets may be reached via VHF-FM channel 16.

          (1) Vessels engaged in fishing or other operations—that are distinct from vessels following a TSS or a connecting precautionary area east of New Dungeness and which are not required by the Bridge to Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations to maintain a listening watch, are highly encouraged to maintain a listening watch on the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service (PSVTS) VHF-FM radio frequency for the area in which the vessel is operating. A safe alternative to the radio listening watch is to stay clear of the TSS and connecting precautionary area.

          (2) Vessels engaged in gill net fishing at any time between sunset and sunrise in any of the waters defining the regulated navigation are of this section shall, in addition to the navigation lights and shapes required by Part 81 of this title (72 COLREGS), display at the end of the net most distant from the vessel on all-round (32-point) white light visible for a minimum of two nautical miles and displayed from at least three feet above the surface of the water.

          (3) Vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet and purse seine fishing, are prohibited in the following Prohibited Fishing Area: The Hood Canal Bridge, to include the waters within a one-half nautical mile radius of the center of the main ship channel draw span during the immediate approach and transit of the draw by public vessels of the United States.

          (4) East of New Dungeness, vessels engaged in fishing in a traffic lane or connecting precautionary area shall tend nets or other gear placed in the water so as to facilitate the movement of the vessel or gear from the traffic lane or precautionary area upon the approach of a vessel following the TSS.

          (d) Congested Regulations: The provisions under this paragraph apply only when imposed in specific locations by Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service. They are intended to enhance vessel traffic safety during periods and in locations where hazardous levels of vessel traffic congestion are deemed to exist by Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service. Operations potentially creating vessel traffic congestion include, but are not limited to, vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet or purse seine, recreational fishing derbies, regattas, or permitted marine events.

          (1) Vessels engaged in fishing or other operations—that are distinct from vessels following a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) or a connecting precautionary area east of New Dungeness, may not remain in, nor their gear remain in, a traffic lane or a connecting precautionary area east of New Dungeness when a vessel following a TSS approaches. Such vessels not following a TSS or a connecting precautionary area shall draw in their gear, maneuver, or otherwise clear these areas so that their action is complete at least fifteen minutes before the arrival of a vessel following the TSS. Vessels which are required by this paragraph to remain clear of a connecting precautionary area east of New Dungeness or a traffic lane must also remain clear of the adjacent separation zone when in a TSS east of New Dungeness.

          (2) A vessel following the TSS may not exceed a speed of 11 knots through the water.

          (3) Vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet and purse seine fishing, are prohibited in the following Prohibited Fishing Area: Edmonds/Kingston ferry crossing lanes, to include the waters within one-quarter nautical mile on either side of a straight line connecting the Edmonds and Kingston ferry landings during the hours that the ferry is operating.

          (e) Authorization to deviate from this section.

          (1) Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District may, upon written request, issue an authorization to deviate from this section if the proposed deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to or beyond that provided by the required procedure. An application for authorization must state the need for the deviation and describe the proposed alternative operation.

          (2) PSVTS may, upon verbal request, authorize a deviation from this section for a voyage, or part of a voyage, if the proposed deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to or beyond that provided by the required procedure. The deviation request must be made well in advance to allow the requesting vessel and the Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) sufficient time to assess the safety of the proposed deviation. Discussions between the requesting vessel and the VTC should include, but are not limited to, information on vessel handling characteristics, traffic density, radar contracts, and environmental conditions.

          (3) In an emergency, the master, pilot, or person directing the movement of the vessel following the TSS may deviate from this section to the extent necessary to avoid endangering persons, property, or the environment, and shall report the deviation to the VTC as soon as possible.

Datum: NAD 1983.

          (b) During a whale hunt, while the international numeral pennant five (5) is flown by a Makah whale hunt vessel, the following area within the RNA is a Moving Exclusion Zone: The column of water from the surface to the seabed with a radius of 500 yards centered on the Makah whale hunt vessel displaying international numeral pennant five (5). This Moving Exclusionary Zone is activated only when surface visibility exceeds one nautical mile, between sunrise and sunset, and the Makah whale hunt vessel displays the international numeral pennant five (5). The Moving Exclusionary Zone is deactivated upon sunset, visibility is reduced to less than one nautical mile, or when the Makah hunt vessel strikes international numeral pennant five (5).

          (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District or his or her representative, no person or vessel may enter the active Moving Exclusionary Zone except for:

          (1) Authorized Makah whale hunt vessel actively engaged in hunting operations under direction of the master of the Makah vessel flying international numeral pennant five (5), and

          (2) A single authorized media pool vessel operating in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

          (d) The international numeral pennant five (5) is only authorized to be displayed from one Makah whale hunt vessel during actual whale hunt operations. No other vessels may display this pennant within the RNA at any time. Whale hunt operations commence when a whale hunt vessel is underway and its master intends to have a whale killed during the voyage. Whale hunt operations cease once this intent is abandoned, a whale is landed, or when the international numeral pennant five (5) is struck.

          (e) The Makah Tribe shall make SECURITE broadcasts beginning one half hour before the commencement of a hunt and every half hour thereafter until hunting activities are concluded. This broadcast shall be made on channel 16 VHF-FM and state:

          (f)(1) Credentialed members of the media interested in entering the Moving Exclusionary Zone may request permission to operate a single media vessel in the Moving Exclusionary Zone by telephoning Coast Guard Public Affairs, as soon as practicable at (206) 220-7237 during normal working hours, and (206) 220-7001 after hours. Coast Guard preauthorization is required prior to entry into the Moving Exclusionary Zone by a single media pool vessel.

          (b)  The general regulations governing security zones contained in 33 CFR 165.33 apply. Entry into, transit through, or anchoring within this zone while it is activated, and thus subject to enforcement, is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or a designated representative thereof.

          (c)  The Coast Guard will suspend enforcement of the security zone described in this section whenever the SBX-1 is within the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area (see 6 FR 6675).

          (d)  The Captain of the Port of Honolulu will cause notice of the enforcement of the security zone described in this section to be made by broadcast notice to mariners. The SBX-1 is easy to recognize because it contains a large white object shaped like an egg supported by a platform that is larger than a football field. The platform in turn is supported by six pillars similar to those on large oil-drilling platforms.

          (e)  Any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer, and any other Captain of the Port representative permitted by law, may enforce the security zone described in this section.

          (f)  The Captain of the Port may waive any of the requirements of this rule for any person, vessel, or class of vessel upon finding that application of the security zone is unnecessary or impractical for the purpose of maritime security.

          (g)  Vessels or persons violating this rule are subject to the penalties set forth in 46 U.S.C. 70036 and 46 U.S.C. 70052.

          § 165.1413   Regulated navigation area; Southern Oahu Tsunami Evacuation; Honolulu, Hawaii.

#### § § 165.1413

          (a)  The following area is a regulated navigation area (RNA): All waters of the Pacific Ocean south of the southern side of Oahu, HI extending from the surface of the water to the ocean floor, and is bound by a line connecting the following points: 21°17′14″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°48′20″ W; 21°14′14″ N, 157°48′20″ W thence westward along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. These coordinates are based upon the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coast Survey, Pacific Ocean, Oahu, Hawaii, chart 19357.

          (b)  You may contact the Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16 (156.800 MHz) or at telephone number 808-842-2600, to obtain clarification on RNA transits and locations. Operations permitting, the Coast Guard plans to provide on-scene direction using Coast Guard patrol boats and assets. During the enforcement period persons and vessels wishing to remain inside the RNA must abide by the following stipulations:

          (1) No person or vessel may enter into an exclusionary area 3.7 nautical miles long by 1 nautical mile wide, centered lengthwise and along a line running seaward at 208 degrees southwest of Honolulu Harbor Front Range Light, except to transit to or from the staging areas or other areas outside the zone. Loitering or lingering in the exclusionary zone is prohibited.

          (2) The Western Recreational Vessel Staging area is bound by the following points: 21°17′14″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′17″ W; 21°16′46″ N, 157°53′23″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. This staging area is intended for recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Keehi Lagoon area.

          (3) The Commercial Vessel Staging Area is bound by a line connecting the following points: 21°16′48″ N, 157°52′10″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°54′05″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°51′36″ W; 21°15′55″ N, 157°50′58″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. This staging area is intended for use by all commercial vessels intended to remain in the RNA during a tsunami treat.

          (4) The Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area is bound by the following points: 21°15′55″ N, 157°50′58″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°51′36″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°48′20″ W; 21°14′14″ N, 157°48′20″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. The Commercial Vessel Staging Area borders this staging area's western edge. The dividing line between the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area can be determined visually. The private dayboards located in the Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor and the La Ronde Rotating Restaurant roof top restaurant form a natural range that mariners can use in daylight hours to gauge the eastern boundary of the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the western boundary of the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area. This eastern recreational staging area is intended for use by recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Ala Wai Small Boat harbor and Kewalo Basin.

          (5) Located between the Western Recreational Vessel Staging Area and the Commercial Vessel Staging Area is an Exclusion Area. This area is bound by the following points: 21°16′46″ N, 157°53′23″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′17″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°54′05″ W; 21°16′48″ N, 157°52′10″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point.

          (6) All vessels staging in the RNA must be seaward of the 50-fathom (300 foot) line.

          (c)  Paragraph (b) of this section will be enforced when a tsunami warning has been issued for the Hawaiian Islands by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The COTP will notify the public of any enforcement, suspension of enforcement, or termination of enforcement through appropriate means to ensure the widest publicity, including the use of broadcast notice to mariners, notices of enforcement and press releases.

          (d)  Vessels or persons violating this rule are subject to the penalties set forth in 46 U.S.C. 70036.

#### § § 166.200

        (a)  Fairways and anchorage areas as described in this section are established to control the erection of structures therein to provide safe approaches through oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to entrances to the major ports along the Gulf Coast.

        (b)  Temporary anchors and attendant cables or chains attached to floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs outside a fairway may be placed within a fairway described in this section for the Gulf of Mexico, provided the following conditions are met:

        (1) Anchors installed within fairways to stablize semisubmersible drilling rigs shall be allowed to remain 120 days. This period may be extended by the Army Corps of Engineers, as provided by § 209.135(b).

        (2) Drilling rigs must be outside of any fairway boundary to whatever distance is necessary to ensure that the minimum depth of water over an anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet.

        (3) No anchor buoys or floats or related rigging will be allowed on the surface of the water or to a depth of at least 125 feet from the surface, within a fairway.

        (4) Aids to Navigation or danger markings must be installed as required by 33 CFR Subchapter C.

        (c)  Structures may be placed within an area designated as a fairway anchorage, but the number of structures will be limited by spacing as follows:

        (1) The center of a structure to be erected shall not be less than two (2) nautical miles from the center of any existing structure.

        (2) In a drilling or production complex, associated structures connected by walkways shall be considered one structure for purposes of spacing, and shall be as close together as practicable having due consideration for the safety factors involved.

        (3) A vessel fixed in place by moorings and used in conjunction with the associated structures of a drilling or production complex, shall be considered an attendant vessel and the extent of the complex shall include the vessel and its moorings.

        (4) When a drilling or production complex extends more than five hundred (500) yards from the center, a new structure shall not be erected closer than two (2) nautical miles from the outer limit of the complex.

        (5) An underwater completion installation in an anchorage area shall be considered a structure and shall be marked with a lighted buoy approved by the United States Coast Guard under § 66.01.

#### § § 167.5

        (a)  means a routing measure comprising an area within defined limits in which either navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and which should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships.

        (b)  (TSS) means a designated routing measure which is aimed at the separation of opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes.

        (c)  means an area within defined limits in which one-way traffic is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones, may constitute a boundary.

        (d)  means a zone or line separating the traffic lanes in which ships are proceeding in opposite or nearly opposite directions; or separating a traffic lane from the adjacent sea area; or separating traffic lanes designated for particular classes of ships proceeding in the same direction.

        (e)  means a routing measure comprising an area within defined limits where ships must navigate with particular caution and within which the direction of traffic flow may be recommended.

        (f)  means an internationally recognized routing measure primarily intended for use by ships that, because of their draft in relation to the available depth of water in the area concerned, require the use of such a route.

        (g)  means a route within defined limits inside which two-way traffic is established, aimed at providing safe passage of ships through waters where navigation is difficult or dangerous.

L. 101-380), as amended by section 711 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-281). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull and double hull tankers over 5,000 GT by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort vessels in applicable waters, as defined in § 168.40. The escort vessels will be immediately available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions.

      (b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel requirements. Nothing in these regulations should be construed as relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in a safe and prudent manner, taking into account the navigational constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and anticipated weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or other operational precautions.

        § 183.3   Definitions.

#### § § 183.3

        means the transverse distance between the outer sides of the boat excluding handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions.

        means any vessel—

        (1) Manufactured or used primarily for noncommercial use;

        (2) Leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter's noncommercial use; or

        (3) Operated as an uninspected passenger vessel subject to the requirements of 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter C.

        means a transom with a maximum width which exceeds one-half the maximum beam of the boat.

        means the straight line horizontal measurement of the overall length from the foremost part of the boat to the aftermost part of the boat, measured from end to end over the deck excluding sheer, and measured parallel to the centerline. Bow sprits, bumpkins, rudders, outboard motor brackets, handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions are not included in the measurement.

        means a boat on which the line of intersection of the water surface and the boat at any operating draft forms a single closed curve. For example, a catamaran, trimaran, or a pontoon boat is not a monohull boat.

        means any arrangement of bulkheads or structures that prevents water from entering the passenger carrying area of the boat through any cutout area in the transom for mounting an outboard motor.

        means the vertical distance from the lowest point of water ingress along the top of the motorwell to a line representing a longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.

        means equipment that is mounted or fastened, so that it is not removable without the use of tools. Seats, inboard engines, windshields, helm stations, or hardtops are permanent appurtenances. Outboard motors, controls, batteries, and portable fuel tanks are not permanent appurtenances.

        means any mechanical assist device which is rigidly attached to the boat and used in steering the vessel, including but not limited to mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical control systems.

        means a boat designed or intended to use sails as the primary means of propulsion.

        means the topmost line in a boat's side. The sheer intersects the vertical centerline plane of the boat at the forward end and intersects the transom (stern) at the aft end. For the purposes of this definition, the topmost line in a boat's side is the line defined by a series of points of contact with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical plane normal to the outside edge of the boat as seen from above and which are brought into contact with the outside of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.

        means the surface at the stern of a boat projecting or facing aft. The upper boundary of the transom is the line defined by a series of points of contact, with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical longitudinal plane and which are brought into contact with the stern of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.

        means the vertical distance from the lowest point of water ingress along the top of the transom to a line representing a longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.

        includes every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water.

      Subpart D—Safe Powering

        § 183.51   Applicability.

#### § § 183.51

        This subpart applies to monohull boats less than 20 feet in length, except sailboats, canoes, kayaks, and inflatable boats, that are designed or intended to use one or more outboard motors for propulsion.

        § 183.53   Horsepower capacity.

#### § § 183.53

        The maximum horsepower capacity marked on a boat must not exceed the horsepower capacity determined by the computation method discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, or for certain qualifying boats, the performance test method discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (a) The maximum horsepower capacity must be computed as follows:

        (1) Compute a factor by multiplying the boat length in feet by the maximum transom width in feet excluding handles and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions. If the boat does not have a full transom, the transom width is the broadest beam in the aftermost quarter length of the boat.

        (2) Locate horsepower capacity corresponding to the factor in Table 183.53.

        (3) For a boat with a factor over 52.5, if the horsepower capacity calculated in Table 183.53 is not an exact multiple of 5, it may be raised to the next exact multiple of 5.

        (4) For flat bottom hard chine boats with a factor of 52 or less, the horsepower capacity must be reduced by one horsepower capacity increment in Table 183.53.

        (b) For boats qualifying under this paragraph, the performance test method described in this paragraph may be used to determine the horsepower capacity.

        (1)  (i) Thirteen feet or less in length;

        (ii) Remote wheel steering;

        (iii) Transom height

        (A) Minimum 19 inch transom height; or,

        (B) For boats with at least a 19 inch motorwell height, a minimum 15 inch transom height;

        (iv) Maximum persons capacity not over two persons;

        (2)  (i) The boat must be rigged with equipment recommended or provided by the boat and motor manufacturer and tested with the highest horsepower production powerplant for which the boat is to be rated, not to exceed 40 horsepower.

        (ii) Standard equipment must be installed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions.

        (iii) The lowest ratio (quickest) steering system offered on the boat model being tested must be installed.

        (iv) The outboard motor must be fitted with the manufacturer's recommended propeller providing maximum speed.

        (v) Standard permanently installed fuel tanks must be no more than one-half full. Boats without permanent tanks must be tested with one full portable tank.

        (vi) Portable tanks must be in their designated location or placed as far aft as possible.

        (vii) The outboard motor must be placed in the lowest vertical position on the transom or, if mounting instructions are provided with the boat, at the height recommended.

        (viii) Boat bottom, motor and propeller must be in new or almost new condition.

        (3)  Testing must be conducted on smooth, calm water with the wind speed below 10 knots. The test must be conducted with no load other than a driver who must weigh no more than 200 pounds. The motor trim angle must be adjusted to provide maximum full throttle speed short of excessive porpoising or propeller ventilation or “cavitation”, so that there is no loss of directional control.

        (4)  Set throttle at a low maneuvering speed and steer the boat straight ahead. Turn the steering wheel 180° in the direction of least resistance in   second or less and hold it at that position without changing the throttle or trim settings during or after the wheel change. The boat completes the maneuver successfully if it is capable of completing a 90° turn without the driver losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. Gradually increase the boat's turn entry speed incrementally until the boat does not complete the Quick Turn Test successfully or successfully completes it at maximum throttle.

        (5)  Set throttle for 30 miles per hour boat speed and run the test course set up in accordance with Figure 183.53, passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 35 to 37.5 miles per hour without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course, increase the throttle setting to 35 to 37.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 37.5 to 42.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 42.5 miles per hour or more and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, continue to increase the throttle setting and run the test course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 42.5 miles per hour or more until the boat fails to complete the test successfully or the boat completes the test course maneuvers successfully at full throttle. The boat successfully completes the test course if the driver is able to maneuver it between the designated avoidance markers without striking the markers and without losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. There must be no change in position of any equipment on board and there must be no change of position of personnel in order to influence the test results. There must be no instability evidenced by oscillating motion in the roll or yaw axes exhibited while negotiating the course.

        (6)  (i) For boats capable of less than 35 miles per hour, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete the Quick Turn Test Procedure in § 183.53(b)(4) at full throttle or the maximum horsepower determined under the calculations in § 183.53(a) of this section.

        (ii) For boats capable of 35 miles per hour or more, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete both the Quick Turn Test Procedure in § 183.53(b)(4) and the Test Course Method in § 183.53(b)(5) at full throttle or the calculations in § 183.53(a) of this section.

        (iii) The maximum horsepower capacity determined in accordance with § 183.53(b) must not exceed 40 horsepower.

          (b) As used in this subpart, the term “passenger carrying area” means each area in a boat in which persons can sit in a normal sitting position or stand while the boat is in operation. Passenger carrying areas are illustrated in Figures 3 through 8.

          (c) The length of each passenger carrying area is the distance along the centerline of the boat between two vertical lines, one at the forward end and one at the aft end of the passenger carrying area, when the boat is level, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. For boats with a curved stem inside the passenger carrying area, the forward vertical line is where a line 45 degrees to the horizontal when the boat is level is tangent to the curve of the stem, as illustrated in Figure 5. For boats with cabins, the forward vertical line is where there is a minimum distance of two feet between the inside top of the cabin and the water line formed when the boat is swamped and loaded with weights under § 183.320 as illustrated in Figure 6.

          (d) The breadth of the passenger carrying area is the distance beteen two vertical lines at the mid-length, excluding consoles, of the passenger carrying area when the boat is level as illustrated in Figures 7 and 8. For boats with round chines inside the passenger carrying area, the vertical line is where a transverse line 45 degrees to the horizontal is tangent to the arc of the chine, as illustrated in Figure 7.

        (d) An owner of record who fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section, a person who solicits or colludes in a failure by an owner of record to comply with paragraph (a) of this section, or an insurer that fails to comply with paragraph (c) of this section is subject to penalty as prescribed by state law.

        § 187.311   Maintenance of and access to files.

#### § § 187.311

        (a) For each record relating to a certificate of title submitted to the office, the office must—

        (1) Ascertain or assign the hull identification number (HIN) for the vessel in accordance with 33 CFR part 181;

        (2) Maintain the HIN and all the information submitted with the application pursuant to § 187.307(b) to which the record relates, including the date and time the record was delivered to the office;

        (3) Maintain the files for public inspection subject to paragraph (e) of this section; and

        (4) Index the files of the office as required by paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) The office must maintain in its files the information contained in all certificates of title created under this subpart. The information in the files of the office must be searchable by the HIN of the vessel, the vessel number, the name of the owner of record, and any other method used by the office.

        (c) The office must maintain in its files, for each vessel for which it has created a certificate of title, all title brands known to the office, the name of each secured party known to the office, the name of each person known to the office to be claiming an ownership interest, and all stolen-property reports the office has received.

        (d) Upon request, for safety, security, or law-enforcement purposes, the office must provide to Federal, State, or local government the information in its files relating to any vessel for which the office has issued a certificate of title.

        (e) Except as otherwise provided by laws of the titling State, the information required under § 187.309 is a public record, but the information provided under § 187.307(b)(3) is not a public record.

        § 187.312   Action required on creation of certificate of title.

#### § § 187.312

        (a) On creation of a written certificate of title, the office must promptly send the certificate to the secured party of record or, if none, to the owner of record, at the address indicated for that person in the files of the office. On creation of an electronic certificate of title, the office must promptly send a record evidencing the certificate to the owner of record and, if there is one, to the secured party of record, at the address indicated for that person in the files of the office. The office may send the record to the person's mailing address or, if indicated in the files of the office, an electronic address.

        (b) If the office creates a written certificate of title, any electronic certificate of title for the vessel is canceled and replaced by the written certificate. The office must maintain in the files of the office the date and time of cancellation.

        (c) Before the office creates an electronic certificate of title, any written certificate for the vessel must be surrendered to the office. If the office creates an electronic certificate, the office must destroy or otherwise cancel the written certificate for the vessel that has been surrendered to the office and maintain in the files of the office the date and time of destruction or other cancellation. If a written certificate being canceled is not destroyed, the office must indicate on the face of the certificate that it has been canceled.

        § 187.313   Effect of certificate of title.

#### § § 187.313

        A certificate of title is  evidence of the accuracy of the information in the record that constitutes the certificate.

        § 187.314   Effect of possession of certificate of title; judicial process.

#### § § 187.314

        Possession of a certificate of title does not by itself provide a right to obtain possession of a vessel. Garnishment, attachment, levy, replevin, or other judicial process against the certificate is not effective to determine possessory rights to the vessel. This subpart does not prohibit enforcement under State law, other than this subpart (33 CFR part 187 subpart D), of a security interest in, levy on, or foreclosure of a statutory or common-law lien on a vessel. Absence of an indication of a statutory or common-law lien on a certificate does not invalidate the lien.

        § 187.315   Perfection of security interest.

#### § § 187.315

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section or a savings clause provided under state law, a security interest in a vessel may be perfected only by delivery to the office of an application for a certificate of title that identifies the secured party and otherwise complies with § 187.307. The security interest is perfected on the later of delivery to the office of the application and the applicable fee or attachment of the security interest as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods.

        (b) If the interest of a person named as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor in an application for a certificate of title delivered to the office is a security interest, the application sufficiently identifies the person as a secured party. Identification on the application for a certificate of a person as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor is not by itself a factor in determining whether the person's interest is a security interest.

        (c) If the office has created a certificate of title for a vessel, a security interest in the vessel may be perfected by delivery to the office of an application, on a form the office may require, to have the security interest added to the certificate. The application must be signed by an owner of the vessel or by the secured party and must include—

        (1) The name of the owner of record;

        (2) The name and mailing address of the secured party;

        (3) The hull identification number (HIN) for the vessel; and

        (4) If the office has created a written certificate of title for the vessel, the certificate.

        (d) A security interest perfected under paragraph (c) of this section is perfected on the later of delivery to the office of the application and all applicable fees or attachment of the security interest as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods.

        (e) On delivery of an application that complies with paragraph (c) of this section and payment of all applicable fees, the office must create a new certificate of title pursuant to § 187.308 and deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate pursuant to § 187.312(a). The office must maintain in the files of the office the date and time of delivery of the application to the office.

        (f) If a secured party assigns a perfected security interest in a vessel, the receipt by the office of a statement providing the name of the assignee as secured party is not required to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees from the original debtor. Upon obtaining a release from the secured party indicated in the files of the office or on the certificate, a purchaser of a vessel subject to a security interest takes free of the security interest and of the rights of a transferee unless the transfer is indicated in the files of the office or on the certificate.

        (g) This section does not apply to a security interest—

        (1) Created in a vessel by a person during any period in which the vessel is inventory held for sale or lease by the person or is leased by the person as lessor if the person is in the business of selling vessels;

        (2) In a barge for which no application for a certificate of title has been delivered to the office; or

        (3) In a vessel before delivery if the vessel is under construction, or completed, pursuant to contract and for which no application for a certificate has been delivered to the office.

        (h) This paragraph applies if a certificate of documentation for a documented vessel is deleted or canceled. If a security interest in the vessel was valid immediately before deletion or cancellation against a third party as a result of compliance with 42 U.S.C. 31321, the security interest is and remains perfected until the earlier of 4 months after cancellation of the certificate or the time the security interest becomes perfected under this subpart.

        (i) A security interest in a vessel arising under State law related to security interests in goods is perfected when it attaches but becomes unperfected when the debtor obtains possession of the vessel, unless before the debtor obtains possession the security interest is perfected pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section.

        (j) A security interest in a vessel as proceeds of other collateral is perfected to the extent provided in State law.

        (k) A security interest in a vessel perfected under the law of another jurisdiction is perfected to the extent provided in State law.

        § 187.316   Termination statement.

#### § § 187.316

        (a) A secured party indicated in the files of the office as having a security interest in a vessel must deliver a termination statement to the office and, on the debtor's request, to the debtor, by the earlier of—

        (1) Twenty days after the secured party receives a signed demand from an owner for a termination statement and there is no obligation secured by the vessel subject to the security interest and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value secured by the vessel; or

        (2) If the vessel is consumer goods, 30 days after there is no obligation secured by the vessel and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value secured by the vessel.

        (b) If a written certificate of title has been created and delivered to a secured party and a termination statement is required under paragraph (a) of this section, the secured party, not later than the date required by paragraph (a), must deliver the certificate to the debtor or to the office with the statement. If the certificate is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or is otherwise unavailable or illegible, the secured party must deliver with the statement, not later than the date required by paragraph (a), an application for a replacement certificate meeting the requirements of § 187.322.

        (c) On delivery to the office of a termination statement authorized by the secured party, the security interest to which the statement relates ceases to be perfected. If the security interest to which the statement relates was indicated on the certificate of title, the office must create a new certificate and deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate. The office must maintain in its files the date and time of delivery to the office of the statement.

        (d) A secured party that fails to comply with this section is liable for any loss that the secured party had reason to know might result from its failure to comply and which could not reasonably have been prevented and for the cost of an application for a certificate of title under § 187.307 or § 187.322.

        § 187.317   Transfer of ownership.

#### § § 187.317

        (a) On voluntary transfer of an ownership interest in a vessel covered by a certificate of title, the following rules apply:

        (1) If the certificate is a written certificate of title and the transferor's interest is noted on the certificate, the transferor must promptly sign the certificate and deliver it to the transferee. If the transferor does not have possession of the certificate, the person in possession of the certificate has a duty to facilitate the transferor's compliance with this paragraph. A secured party does not have a duty to facilitate the transferor's compliance with this paragraph if the proposed transfer is prohibited by the security agreement.

        (2) If the certificate of title is an electronic certificate of title, the transferor must promptly sign and deliver to the transferee a record evidencing the transfer of ownership to the transferee.

        (3) The transferee has a right enforceable by specific performance to require the transferor comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

        (b) The creation of a certificate of title identifying the transferee as owner of record satisfies paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) A failure to comply with paragraph (a) or to apply for a new certificate of title does not render a transfer of ownership of a vessel ineffective between the parties. Except as otherwise provided in § 187.318, § 187.319, § 187.323(a), or § 187.324, a transfer of ownership without compliance with paragraph (a) of this section is not effective against another person claiming an interest in the vessel.

        (d) A transferor that complies with paragraph (a) of this section is not liable as owner of the vessel for an event occurring after the transfer, regardless of whether the transferee applies for a new certificate of title.

        § 187.318   Effect of missing or incorrect information.

#### § § 187.318

        Except as otherwise provided as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods, a certificate of title or other record required or authorized by this subpart is effective even if it contains incorrect information or does not contain required information.

        § 187.319   Transfer of ownership by secured party's transfer statement.

#### § § 187.319

        (a) In this section, “secured party's transfer statement” means a record signed by the secured party of record stating—

        (1) That there has been a default on an obligation secured by the vessel;

        (2) The secured party of record is exercising or has exercised post-default remedies with respect to the vessel;

        (3) By reason of the exercise, the secured party of record has the right to transfer the ownership interest of an owner, and the name of the owner;

        (4) The name and last known mailing address of the owner of record and the secured party of record;

        (5) The name of the transferee;

        (6) Other information required by § 187.307(b); and

        (7) One of the following:

        (i) The certificate of title is an electronic certificate;

        (ii) The secured party does not have possession of the written certificate of title created in the name of the owner of record; or

        (iii) The secured party is delivering the written certificate of title to the office with the secured party's transfer statement.

        (b) Unless the office rejects a secured party's transfer statement for a reason stated in § 187.308(c), not later than 20 days after delivery to the office of the statement and payment of fees and taxes payable under State law in connection with the statement or the acquisition or use of the vessel, the office must—

        (1) Accept the statement;

        (2) Amend the files of the office to reflect the transfer; and

        (3) If the name of the owner whose ownership interest is being transferred is indicated on the certificate of title—

        (i) Cancel the certificate even if the certificate has not been delivered to the office;

        (ii) Create a new certificate indicating the transferee as owner; and

        (iii) Deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate.

        (c) An application under paragraph (a) of this section or the creation of a certificate of title under paragraph (b) of this section is not by itself a disposition of the vessel and does not by itself relieve the secured party of its duties under State law.

        § 187.320   Transfer by operation of law.

#### § § 187.320

        (a) In this section—

        (1) “By operation of law” means pursuant to a law or judicial order affecting ownership of a vessel—

        (i) Because of death, divorce or other family law proceeding, merger, consolidation, dissolution, or bankruptcy;

        (ii) Through the exercise of the rights of a lien creditor or a person having a lien created by statute or rule of law; or

        (iii) Through other legal process.

        (2) “Transfer-by-law statement” means a record signed by a transferee stating that by operation of law the transferee has acquired or has the right to acquire an ownership interest in a vessel.

        (b) A transfer-by-law statement must contain—

        (1) The name and last known mailing address of the owner of record and the transferee and the other information required by § 187.307(b);

        (2) Documentation sufficient to establish the transferee's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest;

        (3) A statement that—

        (i) The certificate of title is an electronic certificate of title;

        (ii) The transferee does not have possession of the written certificate of title created in the name of the owner of record; or

        (ii) The transferee is delivering the written certificate to the office with the transfer-by-law statement; and

        (4) Except for a transfer described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence that notification of the transfer and the intent to file the transfer-by-law statement has been sent to all persons indicated in the files of the office as having an interest, including a security interest, in the vessel.

        (c) Unless the office rejects a transfer-by-law statement for a reason stated in § 187.308(c) or because the statement does not include documentation satisfactory to the office as to the transferee's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest, not later than 20 days after delivery to the office of the statement and payment of fees and taxes payable under State law in connection with the statement or with the acquisition or use of the vessel, the office must—

        (1) Accept the statement;

        (2) Amend the files of the office to reflect the transfer; and

        (3) If the name of the owner whose ownership interest is being transferred is indicated on the certificate of title—

        § 187.321   Application for transfer of ownership or termination of security interest without certificate of title.

#### § § 187.321

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in §§ 187.319 and 187.320, if the office receives, unaccompanied by a signed certificate of title, an application for a new certificate that includes an indication of a transfer of ownership or a termination statement, the office may create a new certificate under this section only if—

        (1) All other requirements under §§ 187.307 and 187.308 are met;

        (2) The applicant provides an affidavit stating facts showing that the applicant is entitled to a transfer of ownership or termination statement;

        (3) The applicant provides the office with satisfactory evidence that notification of the application has been sent to the owner of record and all persons indicated in the files of the office as having an interest, including a security interest, in the vessel, at least 45 days have passed since the notification was sent, and the office has not received an objection from any of those persons; and

        (4) The applicant submits any other information required by the office as evidence of the applicant's ownership or right to terminate the security interest, and the office has no credible information indicating theft, fraud, or an undisclosed or unsatisfied security interest, lien, or other claim to an interest in the vessel.

        (b) The office may indicate in a certificate of title created under paragraph (a) of this section that the certificate was created without submission of a signed certificate or termination statement. Unless credible information indicating theft, fraud, or an undisclosed or unsatisfied security interest, lien, or other claim to an interest in the vessel is delivered to the office not later than 1 year after creation of the certificate, on request in a form and manner required by the office, the office must remove the indication from the certificate.

        § 187.322   Replacement certificate of title.

#### § § 187.322

        (a) If a written certificate of title is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or otherwise becomes unavailable or illegible, the secured party of record or, if no secured party is indicated in the files of the office, the owner of record may apply for and, by furnishing information satisfactory to the office, obtain a replacement certificate in the name of the owner of record.

        (b) An applicant for a replacement certificate of title must sign the application, and, except as otherwise permitted by the office, the application must comply with § 187.307.

        § 187.323   Rights of purchaser other than secured party.

#### § § 187.323

        (a) A buyer in ordinary course of business has the protections afforded by State law even if an existing certificate of title was not signed and delivered to the buyer or a new certificate listing the buyer as owner of record was not created.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided in §§ 187.317 and 187.324, the rights of a purchaser of a vessel who is not a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lien creditor are governed by State law.

        § 187.324   Rights of secured party.

#### § § 187.324

        (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the effect of perfection and non-perfection of a security interest and the priority of a perfected or unperfected security interest with respect to the rights of a purchaser or creditor, including a lien creditor, is governed by State law.

        (b) If, while a security interest in a vessel is perfected by any method under this subpart, the office creates a certificate of title that does not indicate that the vessel is subject to the security interest or contain a statement that it may be subject to security interests not indicated on the certificate—

        (1) A buyer of the vessel, other than a person in the business of selling or leasing vessels of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer, acting in good faith and without knowledge of the security interest, gives value and receives possession of the vessel; and

        (2) The security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the vessel that is perfected under § 187.315 after creation of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.

        § 187.325   Duties and operation of office.

#### § § 187.325

        (a) The office must retain the evidence used to establish the accuracy of the information in its files relating to the current ownership of a vessel and the information on the certificate of title.

        (b) The office must retain in its files all information regarding a security interest in a vessel for at least 10 years after the office receives a termination statement regarding the security interest.
