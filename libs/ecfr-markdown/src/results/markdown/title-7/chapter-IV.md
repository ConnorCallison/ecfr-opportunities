    Subpart G—Actual Production History

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516.

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 47787, Sept. 19, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

      § 400.51   Availability of actual production history program.

#### § § 400.51

      (a) This subpart is obsolete for the 2024 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after June 30, 2023, and for the 2025 and succeeding crop years for all crops with a contract change date prior to June 30, 2023.

      (b) An Actual Production History (APH) Coverage Program is offered under the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 457 and all Special Provisions (as defined in 7 CFR 457.8) thereto unless specifically excluded by the Special Provisions.

      (c) The APH program operates within limits prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 ), only on those crops identified in this section in those areas where the actuarial documents provide coverage. Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply.

      § 400.52   Definitions.

#### § § 400.52

      In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance contract, the following definitions apply for the purposes of the APH Coverage Program:

      (a)  Actual Production History.

      (b)  The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield is determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and appraised production) by planted acres for annual crops or by insurable acres for perennial crops.

      (c)  The transitional or determined yield reduced by the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield will equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer records are submitted; 80 percent, if records for one year are submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted.

      (d)  Production determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal. For the purpose of APH “appraised production” specifically excludes production lost due to uninsurable causes.

      (e)  A yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by the sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields divided by the number of yields contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual and or assigned yields. At least four yields will always exist in the database.

      (f)  A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).

      (g)  Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop year defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is being established (except for sugarcane, which begins the calendar year preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance contract).

      (h)  Reports submitted by a producer for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the most recent crop year in the base period.

      (i)  Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH purposes the term does not include any year when the crop was not planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.

      (j)  A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield.

      (k)  An estimated year for certain crops, which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop (attained by using data available from The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage established by the FCIC for each county.

      (l)  Approved APH yields, for certain crops and counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four crop years of production records for a crop within a county.

      (m)  A person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than two crop years.

      (n)  A written record showing the insured crop's annual production and used to determine the insured's yield for insurance purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if applicable, including planted acreage for annual crops, insurable acreage for perennial crops, and harvested and appraised production for the previous crop years. This report must be supported by written verifiable records, measurement of farm stored production, or by other records of production approved by FCIC on an individual basis. Information contained in a claim for indemnity is considered a production report for the crop year for which the claim was filed.

      (o)  The PRD is contained in the crop insurance contract and is the last date production reports will be accepted for inclusion in the database for the current crop year.

      (p)  An estimated yield, for certain crops, generally determined by multiplying the ASCS program yield by a percentage determined by the FCIC for each county and provided on the actuarial table to be used in the APH yield calculation process when less than four consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields are available.

      (q)  Contemporaneous records of acreage and production provided by the insured, which may be verified by FCIC through an independent source, and which are used to substantiate the acreage and production that have been reported on the production report.

      (r)  A person authorized by the FCIC to calculate approved APH yields.

      (s)  Tables for certain crops that indicate unacceptable yield variations and yield trends which will require determination of the APH yield by the FCIC.

      § 400.53   Yield certification and acceptability.

#### § § 400.53

      (a) Production reports must be provided to the crop insurance agent no later than the production reporting date for the crop insured.

      (1) Production reports must provide an accurate account of planted acreage for annual crops or insurable acres for perennial crops, as well as harvested and appraised production by unit.

      (2) The insured must certify the accuracy of the information.

      (3) Production reported for more than one crop year must be continuous. A year in which no acreage was planted to the crop on a unit or no acreage was planted to a practice, type, or variety requiring an APH yield will not be considered a break in continuity. Assigned yields, at the discretion of the FCIC, may be used to maintain continuity of yield data of file. Production on uninsured (for those years a crop insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is in effect) or uninsurable acreage (for other years of the period) will not be used to determine APH yield unless production from such acreage is commingled with production from insured or insurable acreage.

      (b) Production reports and supporting records are subject to audit or review to verify the accuracy of the information certified. Production and supporting records may be reviewed and verified if a claim for indemnity is submitted on the insured crop. The reported yield is subject to revision, if needed, so that the claim conforms to the records submitted at that time.

      (1) Inaccurate production reports or failure to retain acceptable records shall result in the verifier combining optional farm units and recomputing the approved APH yield. These actions shall be taken at any time after reporting or record discrepancies are identified and may result in reduction of the approved APH yield for any calendar year.

      (2) Records must be provided by the insured at the time of an audit, review, or as otherwise requested, to verify that the acreage and production certified are accurate. Records of any other person having shares in the insured crop, which are used by the insured to establish the approved APH yield, must also be provided upon request.

      (3) In the event acreage or production data certified by two or more persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage is different, the verifier shall, at the verifier's discretion, determine which acreage and production data, if any, will be used to determine the approved APH yield. If the correct acreage and production cannot be determined, the data submitted will be considered unacceptable by the verifier for APH purposes.

      (4) Failure of the producer to report acreage and production completely and accurately may result in voidance of the crop insurance contract, as well as criminal or civil false claims penalties pursuant to applicable Federal criminal or civil statutes.

      § 400.54   Submission and accuracy of production reports.

#### § § 400.54

      (a) The insured is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete production reports to the agent. Production reports must be provided for all planted units.

      (b) Records may be requested by the FCIC, or an insurance company reinsured by the FCIC, or by anyone acting on behalf of the FCIC or the insurance company. The insured must provide such records upon request.

      (c) The agent will explain the APH Program to insureds and prospective insureds. When necessary, the agent will assist the insured in preparation of production reports. The agent will determine the adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields in accordance with § 400.54(b). The agent will review the production reports and forward them to the verifier, along with any requested and required supporting records for determination of an approved APH yield.

      (d) The verifier will determine if the certified production reports are acceptable and calculate the approved APH yield.

      § 400.55   Qualification for actual production history coverage program.

#### § § 400.55

      (a) The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing a minimum of four yields and will be updated each subsequent crop year. The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop years and may include actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields. T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur in the database when there are less than four years of actual and/or assigned yields.

      (b) The insured may be required to provide production records to determine the approved APH yield, if production records for the most recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual production are provided, the records must be continuous and contain at least the most recent crop year's actual yield.

      (1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent of T or D-Yield).

      (2) If acceptable production records containing information for only the most recent crop year are provided, the three T or D-Yields adjusted by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and calculate the approved APH yield.

      (3) If acceptable production records containing information for only the two most recent crop years are provided, the two T or D-Yields adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.

      (4) If acceptable production records containing information for only the three most recent crop years are provided, the three actual yields and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.

      (5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple average of the actual yields.

      (6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and unadjusted T or D-Yields.

      (7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to their farming operations and who do not have available records for the added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields for the added land, practice, types or varieties that are based on adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.

      (8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may be based on the producer's APH average yield prior to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.

      (c) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of production reports for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.

      (d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be entered in the database. The resulting average yield will be used to determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of FCIC.

      (e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not provide acceptable production reports for at least the most recent crop year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.

      (f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in the following situations:

      (1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,

      (2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance tables, and

      (3) For perennial crops:

      (i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;

      (ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the production level;

      (iii) If more than two percent of the trees or vines have been removed within the last two years; or

      (iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average yield are requested by the insured.

      (g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC has been performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in accordance with the crop insurance contract.

      (h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master Yields are available. To qualify, the producer must have at least four recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify the authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master Yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the crop's production.

      (i) FCIC may use any production report available under the provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not, involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the approved APH yield.

      § 400.56   Administrative appeal exhaustion.

#### § § 400.56

      The insured may appeal the approved APH yield in accordance with the procedures contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. Administrative remedies through the appeal process must be exhausted prior to any action for judicial review. The approved APH yield determined as a result of the appeal process will be the yield applicable to the crop year.

      § 400.91   Applicability.

#### § § 400.91

      (a) This subpart applies to:

      (1) Adverse decisions made by personnel of the Agency with respect to:

      (i) Contracts of insurance insured by FCIC; and

      (ii) Contracts of insurance of private insurance companies and reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of the Act.

      (2) Determinations of good farming practices made by personnel of the Agency or the reinsured company (see § 400.98).

      (b) This subpart is not applicable to any decision:

      (1) Made by the Agency with respect to any matter arising under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement with the reinsured company; or

      (2) Made by any private insurance company with respect to any contract of insurance issued to any producer by the private insurance company and reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of the Act, except for determinations of good farming practices specified in § 400.91(a)(2).

      (c) With respect to matters identified in § 400.91(a)(1), participants may request an administrative review, mediation, or both, or appeal of adverse decisions by the Agency made with respect to:

      (1) Denial of participation in the crop insurance program;

      (2) Compliance with terms and conditions of insurance;

      (3) Issuance of payments or other program benefits to a participant in the crop insurance program; and

      (4) Issuance of payments or other benefits to an individual or entity who is not a participant in the crop insurance program.

      (d) Only a participant may seek an administrative review and mediation under this subpart, as applicable.

      (e) Notwithstanding any other provision, this subpart does not apply to any decision made by the Agency that is generally applicable to all similarly situated program participants. Such decisions are also not appealable to NAD. If the Agency determines that a decision is not appealable because it is a matter of general applicability, the participant must obtain a review by the Director of NAD in accordance with 7 CFR 11.6(a) of the Agency's determination that the decision is not appealable before the participant may file suit against the Agency.

> [67 FR 13251, Mar. 22, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 37720, June 25, 2003; 74 FR 8704, Feb. 26, 2009]

      § 400.92   Appeals.

#### § § 400.92

      (a) Except for determinations of good farming practices, nothing in this subpart prohibits a participant from filing an appeal of an adverse decision directly with NAD in accordance with part 11 of this title without first requesting administrative review or mediation under this subpart.

      (b) If the participant has timely requested administrative review or mediation, the participant may not participate in a NAD hearing until such administrative review or mediation is concluded. The time for appeal to NAD is suspended from the date of receipt of a request for administrative review or mediation until the conclusion of the administrative review or mediation. The participant will have only the remaining time to appeal to NAD after the conclusion of the administrative review or mediation.

      § 400.93   Administrative review.

#### § § 400.93

      (a) With respect to adverse decisions, an appellant may seek one administrative review or seek mediation under § 400.94.

      (b) If the appellant seeks an administrative review, the appellant must file a written request for administrative review with the reviewing authority in accordance with § 400.95. The written request must state the basis upon which the appellant relies to show that:

      (1) The decision was not proper and not made in accordance with applicable program regulations and procedures; or

      (2) All material facts were not properly considered in such decision.

      (c) The reviewing authority will issue a written decision that will not be subject to further administrative review by the Agency.

> [67 FR 13251, Mar. 22, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 37720, June 25, 2003; 74 FR 8704, Feb. 26, 2009]

      § 400.94   Mediation.

#### § § 400.94

      For adverse decisions only:

      (a) Appellants have the right to seek mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution in addition to an administrative review under § 400.93.

      (b) All requests for mediation under this subpart must be made after issuance of the adverse decision by the Agency and before the appellant has a NAD hearing on the adverse decision.

      (c) An appellant who chooses mediation must request mediation not later than 30 calendar days from receipt of the written notice of the adverse decision. A request for mediation will be considered to have been “filed” when personally delivered in writing to the appropriate decision maker or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is postmarked.

      (d) An appellant will have any balance of the days remaining in the 30-day period to appeal to NAD if mediation is concluded without resolution. If a new adverse decision that raises new matters or relies on different grounds is issued as a result of mediation, the participant will have a new 30-day period for appeals to NAD.

      (e) An appellant is responsible for contacting the Certified State Mediation Program in States where such mediation program exists. The State mediation program will make all arrangements for the mediation process. A list of Certified State Mediation Programs is available at

      (f) An appellant is responsible for making all necessary contacts to arrange for mediation in non-certified States or in certified States that are not currently offering mediation on the subject in dispute. An appellant needing mediation in States without a certified mediation program may request mediation by contacting the RSO, which will provide the participant with a list of acceptable mediators.

      (g) An appellant may only mediate an adverse decision once.

      (h) If the dispute is not completely resolved in mediation, the adverse decision that was the subject of the mediation remains in effect and becomes the adverse decision that is appealable to NAD.

      (i) If the adverse decision is modified as a result of the mediation process, the modified decision becomes the new adverse decision for appeal to NAD.

      § 400.95   Time limitations for filing and responding to requests for administrative review.

#### § § 400.95

      (a) A request for administrative review must be filed within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the adverse decision. A request for an administrative review will be considered to have been “filed” when personally delivered in writing to the appropriate decision maker or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is postmarked.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an untimely request for administrative review may be accepted and acted upon if the participant can demonstrate a physical inability to timely file the request for administrative review.

      § 400.96   Judicial review.

#### § § 400.96

      Except as provided in § 400.98, with respect to adverse determinations:

      (a) A participant must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of an adverse decision. This requires the participant to appeal an Agency adverse decision to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11 prior to seeking judicial review of the adverse decision.

      (b) If the adverse decision involves a matter determined by the Agency to be not appealable, the appellant must request a determination of non-appealability from the Director of NAD, and appeal the adverse decision to NAD if the Director determines that it is appealable, prior to seeking judicial review.

      (c) A participant with a contract of insurance reinsured by the Agency may bring suit against the Agency if the suit involves an adverse action in a United States district court after exhaustion of administrative remedies as provided in this section. Nothing in this section can be construed to create privity of contract between the Agency and a participant.

      § 400.97   Reservations of authority.

#### § § 400.97

      (a) Representatives of the Agency may correct all errors in entering data on program contracts and other program documents, and the results of computations or calculations made pursuant to the contract.

      (b) Nothing contained in this subpart precludes the Secretary, the Manager of FCIC, or the Administrator of RMA, or a designee, from determining at any time any question arising under the programs within their respective authority or from reversing or modifying any adverse decision.

      § 400.98   Reconsideration process.

#### § § 400.98

      (a) This reconsideration process only applies to determinations of good farming practices under § 400.91(a)(2).

      (b) A determination or reconsideration decision regarding good farming practices is not an adverse action and cannot be appealed to NAD.

      (c) Only reconsideration is available for determinations of good farming practices. Mediation is not available for determinations of good farming practices.

      (d) If the insured seeks reconsideration, the insured must file a written request for reconsideration to the following: USDA RMA Deputy Administrator for Insurance Services, Stop 0801, Room 2004-South ATTN: GFP RECONSIDERATION 1400 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20250-0801, by email to  or to a successor site or email.

      (1) A request for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the determination regarding good farming practices. A request for reconsideration will be considered to have been “filed” when personally delivered in writing to FCIC or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is postmarked.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an untimely request for reconsideration may be accepted and acted upon if the insured can demonstrate a physical inability to timely file the request for reconsideration.

      (3) Reconsideration of a good farming practice (GFP) determination will be limited to a closed review of the existing administrative record. The written request must state the basis upon which the insured relies to show that:

      (i) The decision was not proper and not made in accordance with applicable program regulations and procedures; or

      (ii) The previously provided material facts were not properly considered in such decision.

      (e) With respect to determinations of good farming practices, the insured is not required to exhaust the administrative remedies in 7 CFR part 11 before bringing suit against FCIC in a United States district court. However, regardless of whether the Agency or the reinsured company makes the determination, the insured must seek reconsideration under § 400.98 before bringing suit against FCIC in a United States District Court. The insured cannot file suit against the reinsured company for determinations of good farming practices.

      (f) Any reconsideration decision by the Agency regarding good farming practices shall not be reversed or modified as a result of judicial review unless the reconsideration decision is found to be arbitrary or capricious.

      § 400.302   Definitions.

#### § § 400.302

      means Federal Crop Insurance _Act_ as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 ).

      means a person who, in return for a share of profits and losses, makes a contribution to the production of an insurable crop in the form of capital, equipment, land, personal labor, or personal management.

      means total harvested production of a crop divided by the number of acres on which the crop was planted. For insured acres, actual yield is the total production to count as defined in the insurance policy, divided by insured acres.

      means units of crop production per acre administratively assigned by the Corporation for the purpose of determining insurance coverage.

      means the Federal Crop Insurance _Corporation_.

      is the total premium earned for all years in the base period, divided by the total liability for all years in the base period with the result expressed as a percentage.

      means the ratio of total indemnities to total earned premiums during the base period expressed as a decimal.

      means premium earned (both the amount subsidized and the amount paid by the producer, but excluding any amount of the subsidy attributed to the operating and administrative expenses of the insurance provider) for a crop under a policy insured or reinsured by the Corporation.

      —means premium earned divided by liability and expressed as a percentage.

      —means a person as defined in this subpart other than an individual.

      means a loss applicable for the policy for any year during the NCS base period for which the total indemnity exceeds the total earned premium. If the person has insurance for the crop in more than one county for any crop year, indemnities and premiums will be accumulated for all counties for each crop year to determine an indemnified loss.

      means earned premiums, indemnities paid (but not including replant payments), and other data for the crop (after applicable adjustments), resulting from all of the insured's crop insurance policies insured or reinsured by the Corporation for one or more crop years and will include all information from all counties in which the person was insured.

      —means the ratio of indemnity to earned premium expressed as a decimal.

      means nonstandard classification system.

      means the 10 consecutive crop years (as defined in the crop policy) ending 2 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective for all crops, except those specified on the Special Provisions. For these excepted crops, the _NCS base period_ means the 10 consecutive crop years ending 3 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective. For example: An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of citrus production in Arizona, California, and Texas, or sugarcane would have a NCS base period that includes the 1984 through 1993 crop years. An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of all other crops would have a NCS base period that includes the 1985 through 1994 crop years.

      —means an individual, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal entity, and whenever applicable, a State or a political subdivision, or agency of a state.

      —means an interest of 10 percent or more. In determining whether such an interest equals at least 10 percent, all interests which are owned directly or indirectly through such means as ownership of shares in a corporation which owns the interest will be taken into consideration.

      § 400.303   Initial selection criteria.

#### § § 400.303

      (a) Nonstandard classification procedures in this subpart initially apply when all of the following insurance experience criteria (including any applicable adjustment in § 400.303(d)) for the crop have been met:

      (1) Three (3) or more indemnified losses during the NCS base period;

      (2) Cumulative indemnities in the NCS base period that exceed cumulative premiums during the same period by at least $500;

      (3) The result of dividing the number of indemnified losses during the NCS base period by the number of years premium is earned for that period equals .30 or greater; and

      (4) Either of the following apply:

      (i) The natural logarithm of the cumulative earned premium rate multiplied by the square root of the cumulative loss ratio equals 2.00 or greater; or

      (ii) Five (5) or more indemnified losses have occurred during the NCS base period and the cumulative loss ratio equals or exceeds 1.50.

      (b) The minimum standards provided in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section may be increased in a specific county if that county's overall insurance experience for the crop is substantially different from the insurance experience for which the criteria was determined. The increased standard will apply until the conditions requiring the increase no longer apply. Any change in the standards will be contained in the Special Provisions for the crop.

      (c) Selection criteria may be applied on the basis of insurance experience of a person, insured acreage, or the combination of both.

      (1) Insurance experience of a person will include:

      (i) Insurance experience of the person;

      (ii) Insurance experience of other insured entities in which the person had substantial beneficial interest if the person was actively engaged in farming of the insured crop by virtue of the person's interest in those insured entities;

      (iii) Insurance experience of a spouse and minor children if the person is an individual and the spouse and minor children are considered the same as the individual under § 400.306.

      (2) Insurance experience of insured acreage includes all insurance experience during the base period resulting from the production of the insured crop on the acreage.

      (3) Where insurance experience is based on a combination of person and insured acreage, the insurance experience will include the experience of the person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section (1) only on the specific insured acreage during the base period.

      (d) Insurance experience for the crop will be adjusted, by county and crop year, to discount the effect of indemnities caused by widespread adverse growing conditions. Adjustments are determined as follows:

      (1) Determine the average yield for the county using the annual county crop yields for the previous 20 crop years, unless such data is not available;

      (2) Determine the normal variability in the average yield for the county, expressed as the standard deviation;

      (3) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(2) from § 400.303(d)(1);

      (4) Divide the annual crop yield for the county for each crop year in the NCS base period by the result of § 400.303(d)(3), the result of which may not exceed 1.0;

      (5) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(4) for each crop year from 1.0;

      (6) Multiply the result of § 400.303(d)(5) by the liability for the crop year; and

      (7) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(6) from any indemnity for that crop year.

      (e) FCIC may substitute the crop yields of a comparable crop in determining § 400.303(d) (1) and (2), or may adjust the average yield or the measurement of normal variability for the county crop, or any combination thereof, to account for trends or unusual variations in production of the county crop or if the availability of yield and loss data for the county crop is limited. Information about how these determinations are made is available by submitting a request to the FCIC Regional Service Office for the producer's area. Alternate methods of determining the effects of adverse growing conditions on insurance experience may be implemented by FCIC if allowed in the Special Provisions.

      § 400.304   Nonstandard Classification determinations.

#### § § 400.304

      (a) Nonstandard Classification determinations can affect a change in assigned yields, premium rates, or both from those otherwise prescribed by the insurance actuarial tables.

      (b) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of insured acreage (or of a person on specific insured acreage) will be based on the simple average of available actual yields from the insured acreage during the base period.

      (c) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of a person without regard to any specific insured acreage will be determined by an assigned yield factor calculated by multiplying excess loss cost ratio by loss frequency and subtracting that product from 1.00 where:

      (1) Excess loss cost ratio is total indemnities divided by total liabilities for all years of insurance experience in the base period and the result of which is then reduced by the cumulative earned premium rate, expressed as a decimal, and

      (2) Loss frequency is the number of crop years in which an indemnity was paid divided by the number of crop years in which premiums were earned during the base period.

      (d) Changes of premium rates will be made to reflect premium rates that would have resulted in insurance experience during the base period with a loss ratio of 1.00 but:

      (1) A higher loss ratio than 1.00 may be used for premium rate determinations provided that the higher loss ratio is applied uniformly in a county; and

      (2) If a Nonstandard Classification change has been made to current assigned yields, insurance experience during the base period will be adjusted to reflect the affects of changed assigned yields before changes of premium rates are calculated based on that experience.

      (e) Once selection criteria have been met in any year, Nonstandard Classification adjustments will be made from year to year until no further changes are necessary in assigned yields or premium rates under the conditions set forth in § 400.304(f). In determining whether further changes are necessary, the eligibility criteria will be recomputed each subsequent year using the premium rates and yields which would have been applicable had this part not been in effect.

      (f) Nonstandard Classification changes will not be made that:

      (1) Increase assigned yields or decrease premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables, or

      (2) Result in less than a 10 percent decrease in assigned yields or less than a 10 percent increase in premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables.

      § 400.305   Assignment of Nonstandard Classifications.

#### § § 400.305

      (a) Assignment of a Nonstandard Classification of assigned yields, assigned yield factors, or premium rates shall be made on forms approved by the Corporation and included in the actuarial tables for the county.

      (b) Nonstandard classification assignment will be made each year, for the year identified on the assignment forms, and are not subject to change under the provisions of this subpart by the Corporation for that year when included in the actuarial tables for the county, except as a result of a request for reconsideration as provided in section 400.309, or as the result of appeals under 7 CFR part 11.

      (c) A nonstandard classification may be assigned to identified insurable acreage; a person; or to a combination of person and identified acreage for a crop or crop practice, type, variety, or crop option or amendment whereby:

      (1) Classifications assigned to identified insurable acreage apply to all acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage;

      (2) Classifications assigned to a person apply to all insurable acres of the insured crop on which the person and any entity in which the person has substantial beneficial interest is actively engaged in farming; and

      (3) Classifications assigned to a combination of a person and identified insurable acreage will only apply to those acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage on which the named person is actively engaged in producing such crop.

      § 400.306   Spouses and minor children.

#### § § 400.306

      (a) The spouse and minor children of an individual are considered to be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart except that:

      (ii) Approved insurance providers who:

      (A) Commit a single violation resulting in an overpayment in excess of $100,000; and

      (B) Commit multiple acts of violations resulting in an overpayment in excess of $500,000; and

      (iii) Any participant or person who commits such other action or omission of so serious a nature that imposition of the maximum is appropriate.

      (d) With respect to the imputing of conduct:

      (1) The conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to that organization when such conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the violation is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      (2) The conduct of any organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, knows, or had reason to know of such conduct.

      (3) The conduct of one organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to another organization when such conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      (4) If such conduct is imputed, the person to whom the conduct is imputed to may be subject to the same disqualification and civil fines as the person from whom the conduct is imputed. The factors contained in § 400.454(c)(2) will be taken into consideration with respect to the person to whom the conduct is being imputed.

      (e) With respect to disqualifications:

      (i) It is a participant's responsibility to periodically review the ITS and EPLS to determine those participants and other persons who have been disqualified.

      (ii) No participant may conduct business with a disqualified participant or other person if such business directly relates to the Federal crop insurance program, or if, through the business relationship, the disqualified participant or other person will derive any monetary or non-monetary benefit from a program administered under the Act.

      (iii) If a participant or other person does business with a disqualified participant or other person, such participant may be subject to disqualification under this section.

      (iv) Continuing to make payments to a disqualified person to fulfill pre-existing contractual or statutory obligations after the business relationship is terminated will not be considered as doing business with a disqualified person unless such payment is used as a means to circumvent the disqualification process.

      (f) With respect to civil fines:

      (1) A civil fine may be imposed for each violation.

      (2) The amount of such civil fine shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in 7 CFR 3.91 (b)(7).

      (iii) FCIC, in its sole discretion, may reduce or otherwise settle any civil fine imposed under this section whenever it considers it appropriate or in the best interest of the USDA.

      (4) The ineligibility procedures established in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U are not applicable to ineligibility determinations made under this section for nonpayment of civil fines.

      (5) If a civil fine has been imposed and the person has not made timely payment for the total amount due, the person is ineligible to participate in the Federal crop insurance program until the amount due is paid in full.

      (g) With respect to any person that has been disqualified or is otherwise ineligible due to non-payment of civil fines in accordance with § 400.454(f):

      (1) With respect to producers:

      (i) All existing insurance policies will automatically terminate as of the next termination date that occurs during the period of disqualification and while the civil fine remains unpaid;

      (ii) No new policies can be purchased, and no current policies can be renewed, between the date that the producer is disqualified and the date that the disqualification ends; and

      (iii) New application for insurance cannot be made for any agricultural commodity until the next sales closing date after the period of disqualification has ended and the civil fine is paid in full.

      (2) With respect to all other persons:

      (i) Such person may not be involved in any function related to the Federal crop insurance program during the disqualification or ineligibility period (including the sale, service, adjustment, data transmission or storage, reinsurance, etc. of any crop insurance policy) or receive any monetary or non-monetary benefit from a program administered under the Act.

      (ii) If the person is an agent or insurance agency, the producers may cancel their policies sold and serviced by the disqualified agent and rewrite the policy with another agent. If the producer does not cancel and rewrite the policy with another agent, the approved insurance provider must assign the policies to a different agent or agency to service during the period of disqualification or ineligibility. Policies that have been assigned to another agent or agency by the insurance provider will revert back to the disqualified agent or agency after the period of disqualification has ended provided all civil fines are paid in full and the producer does not cancel and rewrite the policy with a different agent or agency;

      (iii) If the person is an approved insurance provider, the approved insurance provider shall not sell, or authorize to be sold, any new policies or may not renew, or authorize the renewal of, existing policies, as determined by FCIC, during the period of disqualification or ineligibility. Nothing in this provision affects the approved insurance provider's responsibilities with respect to the service of existing policies.

      (h) Imposition of disqualification or a civil fine under this section is in addition to any other administrative or legal remedies available under this section or other applicable law including, but not limited to, debarment and suspension.

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 42975, Aug. 20, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 400.650   Purpose.

#### § § 400.650

      The Reform Act requires FCIC to implement a crop insurance program that offers several levels of insurance coverage for producers. These levels of protection include catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverage insurance. This subpart provides notice of the availability of these crop insurance options and establishes provisions and requirements for implementation of the insurance provisions of the Reform Act.

> [61 FR 42975, Aug. 20, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 37721, June 25, 2003]

      § 400.651   Definitions.

#### § § 400.651

      The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 ).

      A level of coverage greater than catastrophic risk protection.

      An amount the producer must pay for catastrophic, and additional coverage each crop year on a per crop and county basis as specified in the Basic Provisions or the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.

      A private insurance company, including its agents, that has been approved and reinsured by FCIC to provide insurance coverage to producers participating in the Federal crop insurance program.

      The actual production history (APH) yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee by summing the yearly actual, assigned, adjusted or unadjusted transitional yields and dividing the sum by the number of yields contained in the database, which will always contain at least four yields. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields. The approved yield may have yield adjustments elected under applicable policy provisions, or other limitations according to FCIC approved procedures applied when calculating the approved yield.

      The minimum level of coverage offered by FCIC which is required before a person may qualify for certain other USDA program benefits unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop. For the 1995 through 1998 crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at sixty percent (60%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC. For the 1999 and subsequent crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC.

      The part of the crop insurance policy that contains provisions of insurance that are specific to catastrophic risk protection.

      A crop that has either contributed in the previous crop year, or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, ten percent (10%) or more of the total expected value of the producer's share of all crops grown in the county. However, a crop will not be considered a crop of economic significance if the expected liability under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is equal to or less than the administrative fee required for the crop.

      (price election) The price per unit of production (or other basis as determined by FCIC) anticipated during the period the insured crop normally is marketed by producers. This price will be set by FCIC before the sales closing date for the crop. The expected market price may be less than the actual price paid by buyers if such price typically includes remuneration for significant amounts of post-production expenses such as conditioning, culling, sorting, packing, etc.

      The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly owned Government Corporation within USDA.

      The Farm Service Agency, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture or any successor agency.

      The value of the producer's interest in the crop that is at risk from an insurable cause of loss during the insurance period. The maximum indemnity payable to the producer may not exceed the indemnity due on the producer's insurable interest at the time of loss.

      A crop stated on the application as submitted on or before the sales closing date for the crop which the producer intended to plant in the crop year for which application is made.

      The legal requirement that a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection coverage for any crop of economic significance as a condition of receiving benefits for such crop from certain other USDA programs in accordance with § 400.655, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

      An individual, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal entity, and wherever applicable, a state or a political subdivision or agency of a state.

      The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, Public Law 103-354.

      The Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture.

      An alternative crop whose sales closing date has passed and that is planted on acreage that is prevented from being planted to an intended crop or where an intended crop is planted and fails.

      An acreage report filed by the producer that certifies that the producer does not have a share in the crop for that crop year.

> [61 FR 42975, Aug. 20, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 40634, July 30, 1998; 64 FR 40742, July 28, 1999; 68 FR 37721, June 25, 2003]

      § 400.652   Insurance availability.

#### § § 400.652

      (a) If sufficient actuarial data are available, FCIC will offer catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverage plans of insurance to indemnify persons for FCIC insured or reinsured crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the applicable crop insurance policy.

      (b) Catastrophic risk protection coverage may be offered through approved insurance providers and through local offices of the Farm Service Agency specified by the Secretary. Additional coverage will only be offered through approved insurance providers unless there is not a sufficient number of approved insurance providers that offer such insurance within a service area.

      (c) A person must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection for the crop on all insurable acreage in the county in which the person has a share on or before the sales closing date designated by FCIC for the crop in the county in order to satisfy the linkage requirements unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

      (d) For additional coverage, in areas where insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity that is insurable elsewhere, FCIC may enter into a written agreement with a person to insure the commodity, provided that the person has actuarially sound data relating to the production of the commodity that is acceptable to FCIC and that such written agreement is specifically allowed by the crop insurance regulations applicable to the crop.

      (e) Failure to comply with all provisions of the policy constitutes a breach of contract and may result in ineligibility for certain other farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already received must be refunded. If a producer breaches the insurance contract, the execution of a waiver of eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance will not be effective for the crop year in which the breech occurred.

      § 400.653   Determining crops of economic significance.

#### § § 400.653

      To be eligible for certain other program benefits under § 400.655 the following conditions will apply with respect to crops of economic significance if the producer does not execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

      (a) If a producer planted a crop of economic significance in the preceding crop year, and does not intend to plant the same crop in the present crop year, the producer does not have to obtain insurance coverage or execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop in the present crop year to comply with the linkage requirements. However, if the producer later decides to plant that crop, the producer will be unable to obtain insurance after the sales closing date and must execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop to be eligible for benefits as specified in § 400.655. Failure to execute such a waiver will require the producer to refund any benefits already received under a program specified in § 400.655.

      (b) The producer is initially responsible to determine the crops of economic significance in the county. The insurance provider may assist the producer in making these initial determinations. However, these determinations will not be binding on the insurance provider. To determine the percentage value of each crop:

      (1) Multiply the acres planted to the crop times the producer's share, times the approved yield, and times the price;

      (2) Add the values of all crops grown by the producer (in the county); and

      (3) Divide the value of the specific crop by the result of paragraph (b)(2).

      (c) The producer may use the type of price, such as the current local market price, futures price, established price, highest amount of insurance, etc., for the price when calculating the value of each crop, provided that the producer uses the same type of price for all crops in the county.

      (d) The producer may be required to justify the calculation and provide adequate records to enable the insurance provider to verify whether a crop is of economic significance.

      § 400.654   Application and acreage report.

#### § § 400.654

      (a) To participate in catastrophic risk protection, or additional coverage plans of insurance, a producer must submit an application for insurance on or before the applicable sales closing date.

      (b) In order to remain eligible for certain farm programs, as specified in § 400.655, a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection on all crops of economic significance, if catastrophic risk protection is available in the county, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

      (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 400.654(a) that applications for insurance be submitted on or before the applicable sales closing date, FCIC may permit a producer to insure crops other than those specified on the application under the following conditions:

      (1) The producer must be unable to plant the intended crop or it is not practical to replant a failed crop before the final planting date. FCIC will take into consideration marketing windows when determining whether it was not practical to replant.

      (2) Conditions must exist to warrant allowing a producer to insure crops other than the intended crop.

      (3) The producer must submit an application for the substitute crop on or before the acreage reporting date for the substitute crop and pay any applicable administrative fee. A producer may not substitute a crop that the producer planted in the preceding crop year unless that crop was listed on a timely filed application for the current crop year.

      (4) If the producer plants a substitute crop that is a crop of economic significance, the producer must obtain CAT coverage, if available, to comply with the linkage requirements specified in § 400.655. The producer may not substitute a crop under this provision if the producer has signed or intends to sign a waiver for emergency crop loss assistance for the crop year.

      (5) The substitute crop must be planted on or before the final planting date or within the late planting period, if applicable, for the substitute crop.

      (6) Under no circumstances may a producer submit an application for additional coverage after the sales closing date for the substitute crop.

      (d) For all coverages, including catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverages, the producer must file a signed acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date. Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign.

      (e) Under catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf an operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained in that acreage report.

      § 400.655   Eligibility for other program benefits.

#### § § 400.655

      The producer must obtain at least catastrophic coverage for each crop of economic significance in the county in which the producer has an insurable share, if insurance is available in the county for the crop, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop, to be eligible for:

      (a) Benefits under the Agricultural Market Transition Act;

      (b) Loans or any other USDA provided farm credit, including: guaranteed and direct farm ownership loans, operating loans, and emergency loans under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act provided after October 13, 1994; and

      means a judgment or any other determination of guilt of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or plea, including a plea of no contest.

      means: The termination date specified in the applicable policy for administrative fees and premiums owed for insurance issued under the authority of the Act, and any interest and penalties on those amounts, if applicable; and the due date specified in the notice to the person of the amount due for any other amounts due the insurance provider or FCIC for insurance issued under the authority of the Act. Other amounts due include, but are not limited to, indemnities, prevented planting payments, or replant payments found not to have been earned or that were overpaid, premium billed with a due date after the termination date for the crop year in which premium is earned, and any interest, administrative fees, and penalties on such amounts, if applicable. Payments postmarked or received before the date of delinquency by the insurance provider or its agent for debts owed to the insurance provider, or by FCIC for debts owed to FCIC, are not delinquent.

      means an amount of money that has been determined to be owed by any person to FCIC or an insurance provider, excluding money owed to an insurance provider's agent, under any program administered under the Act.

> [79 FR 2079, Jan. 13, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 37161, July 1, 2014; 81 FR 42472, June 30, 2016]

      § 400.680   Controlled substance.

#### § § 400.680

      (a) This section implements section 1764 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and Chapter 13 of Title 21 requiring the denial of Federal Benefits, including crop insurance, to individuals convicted of controlled substance violations in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual will be ineligible to participate in any program authorized under the Act, as provided in § 400.683, if the individual is convicted under Federal or State law of planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance in any crop year.

      (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual may, as determined by the court, be ineligible to participate in any program authorized under the Act, as provided in § 400.683, if the person is convicted under Federal or State law of possession of or trafficking in a controlled substance.

      § 400.681   Written payment agreement.

#### § § 400.681

      (a) Written payment agreements shall:

      (1) Require scheduled installment payments that will allow for full repayment of the debt within the time frame allotted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

      (2) Not exceed two years in duration; and

      (3) Not be modified, replaced, or consolidated after it has been executed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) To avoid being determined to be ineligible through the execution of a written payment agreement:

      (1) For a debt arising from any unpaid premium, administrative fees, or catastrophic risk protection fees:

      (i) Only one written payment agreement is permitted per termination date. A written payment agreement may cover multiple crops provided they all have the same termination date; and

      (ii) The written payment agreement must be signed by both parties, the debtor and the insurance provider or FCIC, as applicable, on or before the termination date specified in the applicable policy to prevent an ineligible determination for a delinquent debt.

      (2) For all other debts, the written payment agreement must be signed by both parties, the debtor and the insurance provider or FCIC, as applicable, on or before the due date specified in the notice to the person of the amount due to prevent an ineligible determination for a delinquent debt.

      § 400.682   Determination and notification.

#### § § 400.682

      (a) The insurance provider must send a written notice of the debt to the person, including the time frame in which the debt must be paid, and provide the person with a meaningful opportunity to contest the amount or existence of the debt. Once a debtor has filed bankruptcy and the insurance provider is formally informed of such through the court or the debtor, no request for payment of the debt can be made, unless approved in writing by the Office of General Counsel. The debtor may be notified of the amount of debt and ineligibility for crop insurance.

      (1) The insurance provider shall evaluate the person's response, if any, and determine if the debt is owed and delinquent.

      (2) Upon request by FCIC, the insurance provider shall submit all documentation related to the debt to FCIC.

      (b) If an insurance provider or any other person has evidence that a person meets criteria set forth in § 400.679(a), (b), (c), (e) or (f), they must immediately notify FCIC.

      (c) After the insurance provider determines a person has met one or more of the criteria in § 400.679 and notifies FCIC, FCIC will issue and mail a Notice of Ineligibility to the person's last known address and to the insurance provider. Notices sent to such address will be conclusively presumed to have been received by that person.

      (d) The Notice of Ineligibility will state the criteria upon which the determination of ineligibility has been based, a brief statement of the facts to support the determination, the time period of ineligibility, and the right to appeal the determination to be placed on the ITS in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

      (e) Within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Ineligibility, the ineligible person may appeal FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. The existence and amount of the debt is determined by the insurance provider, not FCIC; therefore, those determinations are not appealable to the National Appeals Division.

      (f) If the person appeals FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division, the insurance provider will be notified and provided with an opportunity to participate in the proceeding, if permitted by 7 CFR part 11.

      (g) No later than 60 days after the termination date, a missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of an overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to the person of an amount due, as applicable, such ineligible person may request consideration for reinstatement from the Administrator, Risk Management Agency, in accordance with section 2 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8).

      § 400.683   Period of ineligibility.

#### § § 400.683

      (a) The beginning of the period of ineligibility will be:

      (1) For ineligibility as a result of a delinquent debt, beginning on the date stated in the applicable policy;

      (2) For ineligibility as a result of a conviction under Federal or State law of:

      (i) Planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance, the beginning of the crop year in which the individual is convicted; or

      (ii) Possession of or trafficking in a controlled substance, the beginning of the crop year in which the individual is convicted, unless determined otherwise by the court.

      (3) For ineligibility as a result of a disqualification, debarment, or suspension under 515(h) of the Act, 2 CFR part 180, 2 CFR part 417, the date the person was disqualified, debarred, or suspended by debarring official, Administrative Law Judge, or such other person authorized to take such action; and

      (4) For debarment under 7 U.S.C. 2209j, the beginning of the crop year in which the person is convicted.

      (b) The duration of the period of ineligibility will be:

      (1) For ineligibility as a result of a delinquent debt, until the debt has been paid in full discharged in bankruptcy, or the person has executed a written payment agreement.

      (2) For ineligibility as a result of a conviction under Federal or State law of:

      (i) Planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance, four crop years succeeding the crop year in which the person was convicted; and

      (ii) Possession of a controlled substance or trafficking in a controlled substance, in addition to the time of ineligibility imposed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, until the period of time imposed by a court has expired.

      (4) For ineligibility as a result of not being a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien, until the date such individual becomes a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien.

      (5) For ineligibility as a result of a conviction falling under 7 U.S.C. 2209j, permanent unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of Agriculture for a period of not less than 10 years.

      § 400.684   Effect of ineligibility.

#### § § 400.684

      (a) The effect of ineligibility depends on the basis for the determination.

      (1) Persons who are ineligible as a result of a delinquent debt are ineligible for crop insurance authorized under the Act for a certain time period in accordance with § 400.683. Filing for bankruptcy does not make the person eligible for crop insurance or preclude the ineligible person from being placed on the ITS in accordance with § 400.684(b)(1).

      (2) Persons who are ineligible as a result of a suspension or debarment are precluded from:

      (i) Participating in all programs authorized under the Act, including but not limited to:

      (ii) Participating in any other covered transaction as specified in 2 CFR part 180 and 2 CFR part 417.

      (3) Persons who are ineligible because of disqualification under section 515(h) of the Act are precluded from participating in all programs authorized under the Act indicated in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and those listed in section 515(h)(3)(B) and (C) of the Act.

      (4) Individuals who are ineligible because of a conviction of a violation of the controlled substance provisions or are not a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien are precluded from participating in any program authorized under the Act indicated in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

      (5) Persons who are ineligible as a result of a conviction falling under 7 U.S.C. 2209j, are precluded from participating in any program offered by USDA.

      (b) Once a person has been determined to be ineligible:

      (1) The ineligible person will be placed on the ITS and may be reported to other government agencies, unless the ineligible person is an individual and the sole reason for ineligibility is because the individual is not a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or qualified alien.

      (2) If the ineligible person is an individual:

      (i) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible person is the sole insured will terminate if the person is ineligible for any reason other than a controlled substance violation, or be void if the person is ineligible due to conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, and the person will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and

      (ii) The ineligible person must be reported on all policies in which the ineligible person has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policy will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the ineligible person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.

      (3) If the ineligible person is a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and is ineligible as a result of:

      (i) A delinquent debt:

      (A) All partners or members of the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will be ineligible;

      (B) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and all partners and members of the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683;

      (C) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture is the sole insured will terminate;

      (D) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible partner or member is the sole insured will terminate; and

      (E) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and all ineligible partners or members must be reported on any other policy in which they have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture or the ineligible partners' or members' substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as they remain ineligible in accordance with § 400.683; or

      (ii) Meeting the criteria specified in § 400.679(c), (e) or (f):

      (A) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture is the sole insured will terminate, and the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and

      (B) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture must be reported on any other policy in which it has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible general partnership's, limited partnership's, limited liability partnership's, limited liability company's, or joint venture's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as it remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.

      (4) If the ineligible person is an association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity, and is ineligible as a result of:

      (i) A delinquent debt:

      (A) Any partners, members, shareholders, administrators, executors, trustees, or grantors may be individually ineligible if the delinquent debt occurred as a result of their actions or inactions, as determined by the insurance provider or FCIC;

      (B) All policies in which the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity is the sole insured will terminate, and it will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683.

      (C) The ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity must be reported on any other policy in which it has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible entity's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683;

      (D) All policies in which a partner, member, shareholder, administrator, executor, trustee, or grantor determined ineligible according to § 400.684(b)(4)(i)(A) is the sole insured will terminate, and the person will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and

      (E) The ineligible partner, member, shareholder, administrator, executor, trustee, or grantor must be reported on any other policy in which they have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683; or

      (ii) Meeting the criteria specified in § 400.679(c), (e) or (f):

      (A) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity is the sole insured will terminate, and the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and

      (B) The ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity must be reported on any other policy in which it has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as it remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.

      (5) If an applicant or insured is a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, limited partnership, or other similar entity that was created to conceal the interest of an ineligible person or to evade the ineligibility determination of a person with a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, the policy will be void.

      (6) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible person is insured as landlord/tenant will terminate on the next termination date. The other person(s) on such policy may submit a new application for crop insurance coverage on or before the applicable sales closing date to obtain insurance coverage for the crop, if they are otherwise eligible for such coverage.

      (c) The spouse and minor child of an individual insured is considered to be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart and subject to the same ineligibility, except when:

      (d) Notwithstanding § 400.684(f), when a policy is voided in accordance with this subpart:

      (1) No indemnities or payments will be paid for the voided policy;

      (2) Any indemnities or payments already made for the voided policy will be declared overpayments and must be repaid in full; and

      (3) No premiums will be due and any premium paid will be refunded except when the policy is void due to a conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, in which case the insured will still be required to pay 20 percent of the premium the insured would otherwise be required to pay to offset costs in the servicing of the policy.

      (e) When the insured share of a policy is reduced in accordance with this subpart:

      (1) Any indemnities or payments commensurate with the share reduced already made will be declared overpayments and must be repaid in full; and

      (2) Any premiums paid by the insured commensurate with the share reduced will be refunded.

      (f) Any insurance written by an insurance provider to any person who is ineligible under the provisions of this subpart is not eligible for reinsurance by FCIC. All premium subsidies, expenses, or other payments made by FCIC for insurance written for any person who is ineligible under the provisions of this subpart must be immediately refunded to FCIC. However, with regard to policies that would be void due to a conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, if the insurance provider follows the procedures of FCIC and the requirements of the regulations, reinsurance will continue to be provided under the reinsurance agreement on the policy unless it is shown that the agent or insurance provider had knowledge of the facts which would indicate ineligibility on the part of the insured and failed to act on that knowledge.

      § 400.685   Criteria for regaining eligibility.

#### § § 400.685

      After the period of ineligibility as specified in § 400.683 has ended, the ineligible person is eligible to participate in programs authorized under the Act, provided the person meets all eligibility requirements.

      (a) After a person regains eligibility for crop insurance when their policy was terminated or voided, the person must submit a new application for crop insurance coverage on or before the applicable sales closing date to obtain insurance coverage for the crop. If the date of regaining eligibility occurs after the applicable sales closing date for the crop, the person may not participate until the following year unless that crop policy allows for applications to be accepted after the sales closing date.

      (b) If a person who was determined ineligible according to this subpart is subsequently determined to be an eligible person for crop insurance through reinstatement, mediation, arbitration, appeal, or judicial review, such person's policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which the producer was determined ineligible, and such person will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided the person meets all eligibility requirements and complies with the terms of the policy.

#### § § 400.686

      (a) Ineligible producer data will be maintained in a system of records established and maintained by the Risk Management Agency in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).

      (1) The ITS contains identifying information of the ineligible person, including but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, SSN or EIN, reason for ineligibility, and time period of ineligibility.

      (2) Information in the ITS may be used by an authorized person. The information may be furnished to other users as may be appropriate or required by law or regulation, including but not limited to, FCIC contracted agencies, other government agencies, credit reporting agencies, and collection agencies, and in response to judicial orders in the course of litigation. The individual information may be made available in the form of various reports and notices.

      (3) Supporting documentation regarding the determination of ineligibility and reinstatement or regaining of eligibility will be maintained by FCIC, or its contractors, insurance providers, Federal agencies, and State agencies. This documentation will be maintained and retained consistent with the electronic information contained within the ITS.

      (b) Information may be entered into the ITS by FCIC employees or contractors, or insurance providers.

      (c) All persons applying for crop insurance policies or with an existing policy, issued or reinsured by FCIC, will be subject to validation of their eligibility status against the ITS. Applications, transfers, or benefits approved and accepted are considered approved or accepted subject to review of eligibility status in accordance with this subpart.

      (d) Insurance providers, partners, cooperators, and contractors must check to ensure that the persons with whom they are doing business are eligible to participate in the programs authorized under the Act. Insurance providers, partners, cooperators, and contractors must check the ITS but the ITS may not include all persons ineligible to receive government benefits, such as persons debarred, disqualified or suspended from receiving government benefits by an agency other than FCIC. Insurance providers, partners, cooperators, and contractors must check other sources that contain ineligible persons, including but not limited to EPLS, or successor list, provide data on persons ineligible to participate in programs authorized under the Act.

      (b) Upon the Board's receipt of a 508(h) submission, the Board will:

      (1) Determine if the 508(h) submission is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the 508(h) submission is deemed to be complete for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);

      (2) Unless the 508(h) submission makes non-significant changes to a policy or plan of insurance, or involves policy provisions that have already undergone expert review, forward the complete 508(h) submission to at least five expert reviewers to review the 508(h) submission:

      (i) Of the five expert reviewers, no more than one will be employed by the Federal Government, and none may be employed by any approved insurance provider or their representative; and

      (J) May have a significant adverse impact on the crop insurance delivery system;

      (K) The marketability assessment reasonably demonstrates the product would be viable and marketable (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);

      (L) If applicable, contains a consultation report that provides evidence the 508(h) submission will not create adverse market distortions; and

      (M) Meets any other criteria the Board may deem necessary;

      (3) Return to the applicant any 508(h) submission the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination and:

      (i) With respect to 508(h) submissions developed from approved concept proposals, the provisions in § 400.712(c)(1) shall apply; and

      (ii) Except for 508(h) submissions developed from concept proposals, if the 508(h) submission is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new 508(h) submission solely for the purpose of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action; and

      (B) Is consistent with USDA's public policy goals;

      (C) Does not increase or shift risk to any other FCIC reinsured policy;

      (D) Can be implemented, administered, and delivered effectively and efficiently using RMA's information technology and delivery systems; and

      (E) Contains requested amounts of government reinsurance, risk subsidy, and administrative and operating subsidies that are reasonable and appropriate for the type of coverage provided by the policy; and

      (ii) Seek review from the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to determine if the 508(h) submission conforms to the requirements of the Act and all applicable Federal statutes and regulations.

      (c) Upon the Board's receipt of a concept proposal, the Board will:

      (1) Determine whether the concept proposal is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the concept proposal is deemed to be a complete concept proposal for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);

      (2) If complete, forward the concept proposal to at least two expert reviewers with underwriting or actuarial experience to review the concept in accordance with section 522(b)(2) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs;

      (3) Return to the applicant any concept proposal the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (If the concept proposal is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new concept proposal solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action);

      (4) Determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would, in good faith, would meet the requirement of being likely to result in a viable and marketable policy consistent with section 508(h) (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);

      (5) At its sole discretion, determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would meet the requirement of providing coverage:

      (i) In a significantly improved form;

      (ii) To a crop or region not traditionally served by the Federal crop insurance program; or

      (iii) In a form that addresses a recognized flaw or problem in the program;

      (6) Determine whether the proposed budget and timetable are reasonable;

      (7) Determine whether the concept proposal meets all other requirements imposed by the Board or as otherwise specified in Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs; and

      (8) Provide a date by which the 508(h) submission must be provided in consultation with the applicant.

      (d) Upon the Board's receipt of an index-based weather plan of insurance, the Board will:

      (1) Determine whether the index-based weather plan of insurance is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the index-based weather plan of insurance is deemed to be complete for the start of the 120-day time-period for approval);

      (2) If determined to be complete, contract with five expert reviewers and review the index-based weather plan of insurance in accordance with section 523(i) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance;

      (3) Return to the applicant any index-based weather plan of insurance the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (if the index-based weather plan of insurance is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action); and

      (4) Give the highest priority for approval of index-based weather plans of insurance that provide a new kind of coverage for specialty crops and livestock commodities that previously had no available crop insurance, or have demonstrated a low level of participation under existing coverage.

      (e) All comments and evaluations will be provided to the Board by a date determined by the Board to allow the Board adequate time for review.

      (f) The Board will consider all comments, evaluations, and recommendations in its review process. Prior to making a decision, the Board may request additional information from RMA, OGC, the expert reviewers, or the applicant.

      (g) In considering whether to approve policies or plans of insurance and when such policies or plans of insurance will be offered for sale, the Board will:

      (1) First, consider policies or plans of insurance that address underserved commodities, including commodities for which there is no insurance;

      (2) Second, consider existing policies or plans of insurance for which there is inadequate coverage or there exists low levels of participation; and

      (3) Last, consider all policies or plans of insurance submitted to the Board that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.

      (h) At any time an applicant may request a time delay after the 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance has been placed on the Board meeting agenda. The Board is not required to agree to such an extension.

      (1) With respect to 508(h) submissions from concept proposals approved by the Board for advanced payment, the applicant must provide good cause why consideration should be delayed.

      (2) Any requested time delay is not limited in the length of time unless a date is set by the Board by which all revisions to the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance must be made. However, delays may make implementation of the 508(h) submission for the targeted crop year impractical or impossible as determined by the Board.

      (3) The time period during which the Board will make a decision to approve or disapprove the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance shall be extended commensurately with any time delay requested by the applicant.

      (i) The applicant may withdraw a 508(h) submission, concept proposal, index-based weather plan of insurance, or a portion of a 508(h) submission or concept proposal, at any time by presenting a request to the Board. A withdrawn 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance that is resubmitted will be deemed a new 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action.

      (j) The Board will render a decision on a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance, with or without revision or give notice of intent to disapprove within 90 days after the date the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance is considered complete by the Board, unless the Board agrees to a time delay in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

      (k) The Board may provide a notice of intent to disapprove a 508(h) submission if it determines:

      (1) The interests of producers and taxpayers are not protected, including but not limited to:

      (i) The 508(h) submission does not provide adequate coverage or treats producers disparately;

      (ii) The applicant has not presented sufficient documentation that the 508(h) submission will provide a new kind of coverage that is likely to be viable and marketable (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);

      (iii) Coverage would be similar to another policy or plan of insurance that has not demonstrated a low level of participation or does not contain a clear and identifiable flaw, and the producer would not significantly benefit from the 508(h) submission;

      (iv) The 508(h) submission may create adverse market distortions or adversely impact other crops or agricultural commodities if marketed;

      (v) The 508(h) submission will have a significant adverse impact on the private delivery system;

      (vi) The 508(h) submission cannot be implemented, administered, and delivered effectively and efficiently using RMA's information technology and delivery systems;

      (viii) The 508(h) submission contains vulnerabilities that allow indemnities to exceed the value of the crop;

      (2) The premium rates are not actuarially appropriate;

      (3) The 508(h) submission does not conform to sound insurance and underwriting principles;

      (4) The risks associated with the 508(h) submission are excessive or it increases or shifts risk to another reinsured policy;

      (5) The 508(h) submission does not meet the requirements of the Act; or

      (6) The 90-day deadline under subsection (j) will expire before the Board has time to make an informed decision to approve or disapprove the 508(h) submission.

      (l) The Board may disapprove a concept proposal if it determines:

      (1) The concept, in good faith, will not likely result in a viable and marketable policy consistent with section 508(h);

      (2) At the sole discretion of the Board, the concept, if developed into a policy and approved by the Board, would not provide crop insurance coverage:

      (i) In a significantly improved form;

      (ii) To a crop or region not traditionally served by the Federal crop insurance program; or

      (iii) In a form that addresses a recognized flaw or problem in the program;

      (3) The proposed budget and timetable are not reasonable, as determined by the Board; or

      (4) The concept proposal fails to meet one or more requirements established by the Board.

      (m) The Board shall provide a notice of intent to disapprove an index-based weather plan of insurance if it determines there is not:

      (1) Adequate experience in underwriting and administering policies or plans of insurance that are comparable to the proposed policy or plan of insurance;

      (2) Sufficient assets or reinsurance to satisfy the underwriting obligations of the approved insurance provider, and possess a sufficient insurance credit rating from an appropriate credit rating bureau, in accordance with Board procedures; and

      (n) Unless otherwise provided for in this section:

      (1) If the Board intends to disapprove a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance, the Board will provide the applicant with a written explanation outlining the basis for the intent to disapprove; and

      (2) Any approval or disapproval of a 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance must be made by the Board in writing not later than 120 days after the Board has determined it to be complete.

      (o) If a notice of intent to disapprove all or part of a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance has been provided by the Board, the applicant must provide written notice to the Board not later than 30 days after the Board provides such notice if the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance will be modified. If the applicant does not respond within the 30-day period, the Board will send the applicant a letter stating the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance is disapproved.

      (p) If the applicant elects to modify the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance:

      (1) The applicant must advise the Board of a date by which the modified 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance will be presented to the Board; and

      (2) The remainder of the time left between the Board's notice of intent to disapprove and the expiration of the 120-day deadline is paused until the modified 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance is received by the Board.

      (3) The Board will disapprove a modified 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance if the:

      (i) Causes for disapproval stated by the Board in its notification of intent to disapprove the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance are not satisfactorily addressed;

      (ii) Board determines there is insufficient time for the Board to finish its review before the expiration of the 120-day deadline for disapproval of a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance, unless the applicant grants the Board an extension of time to adequately consider the modified 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance (If an extension of time is agreed upon, the time period during which the Board must act on the modified 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance will paused during the extension); or

      (iii) Applicant does not present a modification of the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance to the Board on the date the applicant specified and the applicant does not request an additional time delay.

      (q) If the Board fails to render a decision on a new 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance within the time periods specified in paragraph (j) or (n) of this section, such 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance will be deemed approved by the Board for the initial reinsurance year designated for the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance. The Board must approve the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance for it to be available for any subsequent reinsurance year.

      § 400.707   Presentation to the Board for approval or disapproval.

#### § § 400.707

      (a) The Board will inform the applicant of the date, time, and place of the Board meeting.

      (b) The applicant will be given the opportunity and is encouraged to present the 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance to the Board in person.

      (3) If at any time prior to the cancellation date, FCIC discovers there is a mistake, error, or flaw in the policy, plan of insurance, their related materials, or the rates of premium, or any other reason for withdrawal of approval contained in § 400.706(k) exists, FCIC will withdraw reinsurance for such policy or plan of insurance to all AIPs for the subsequent crop year (If reinsurance is denied, a written notice will be provided on RMA's Web site at );

      (4) If maintenance of the policy or plan of insurance is transferred to FCIC in accordance with § 400.712(l), FCIC will assume liability for the policy or plan of insurance for any mistake, error, or flaw that occur after the date the policy is transferred.

      § 400.712   Research and development reimbursement, maintenance reimbursement, advance payments for concept proposals, and user fees.

#### § § 400.712

      (a) For 508(h) submissions approved by the Board for reinsurance under section 508(h) of the Act:

      (1) The 508(h) submission may be eligible for a one-time payment of research and development costs and reimbursement of maintenance costs for up to four reinsurance years, as determined by the Board;

      (2) Reimbursement of research and development costs or maintenance costs will be considered as payment in full by FCIC for the 508(h) submission, and no additional amounts will be owed to the applicant if the 508(h) submission is transferred to FCIC in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section; and

      (3) If the applicant elects at any time not to continue to maintain the 508(h) submission, it will automatically become the property of FCIC and the applicant will no longer have any property rights to the 508(h) submission and will not receive any user fees for the plan of insurance;

      (b) The Board approved procedures and time-frames must be followed, or research and development costs and maintenance costs may not be reimbursed.

      (1) After a 508(h) submission has been approved by the Board for reinsurance, to be considered for reimbursement of:

      (i) Research and development costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before August 1 immediately following the date the 508(h) submission was released to approved insurance providers through FCIC's issuance system; or

      (ii) Maintenance costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before August 1 of each year of the maintenance period.

      (2) Given the limitation on funds, regardless of when the request is received, no payment will be made prior to September 15 of the applicable fiscal year.

      (c) Applicants submitting a concept proposal may request an advance payment of up to 50 percent of the projected total research and development costs, and after the applicant has begun research and development activities, the Board may, at its sole discretion, provide up to an additional 25 percent advance payment of the estimated research and development costs, if the requirements in the definition of advance payment are met and the additional advance payment is requested in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs.

      (1) If a concept proposal is approved by the Board for advance payment, the applicant is responsible for independently developing a 508(h) submission that is complete as specified in this subpart by the deadline set by the Board.

      (i) If an applicant fails to fulfill the obligation to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete by the deadline set by the Board, the Board shall provide a notice of non-compliance to the applicant and allow not less than 30 days for the applicant to respond;

      (ii) If the applicant fails to respond, to the satisfaction of the Board, with just cause as to why a 508(h) submission that is complete was not provided by the deadline set by the Board, the applicant shall return the amount of the advance payment plus interest at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest per calendar month;

      (iii) If the applicant responds, to the satisfaction of the Board, with just cause as to why a 508(h) submission that is complete was not provided by the deadline set by the Board, the applicant will be given a new deadline by which to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete; and

      (iv) If the applicant fails to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete by the deadline, no additional extensions will be approved by the Board and the applicant shall return the amount of the advance payment plus interest at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest per calendar month.

      (2) If an applicant receives an advance payment for a portion of the expected research and development costs for a concept proposal that is developed into a 508(h) submission and determined by the Board to be complete, but the 508(h) submission is not approved by the Board following expert review, the Board will not:

      (i) Seek a refund of any advance payments for research and development costs; and

      (ii) Make any further research and development cost reimbursements associated with the 508(h) submission.

      (d) Under section 522 of the Act, there are limited funds available on an annual fiscal year basis to pay for reimbursements of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs. Consistent with paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section if all applicants' requests for reimbursement of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs in any fiscal year:

      (1) Do not exceed the maximum amount authorized by law, the applicants may receive the full amount of reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board; or

      (2) Exceed the amount authorized by law, each applicant's reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board will be determined by dividing the total amount of each individual applicant's reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section by the total amount of the aggregate of all applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) for the year and multiplying the result by the amount of reimbursement authorized under the Act.

      (e) The amount of reimbursement for research and development costs and maintenance costs requested by the applicant may be reduced as necessary when the requested amount is not commensurate with the complexity or the size of the area proposed to be covered.

      (f) Research and development costs and maintenance costs must be supported by itemized statements and supporting documentation (copies of contracts, billing statements, time sheets, travel vouchers, accounting ledgers, etc.).

      (1) Actual costs submitted will be examined for reasonableness and may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the Board.

      (2) Allowable research and development costs and maintenance costs (directly related to research and development or maintenance of the 508(h) submission only) may include the following:

      (i) Wages and benefits, exclusive of bonuses, overtime pay, or shift differentials;

      (A) One line per employee or contractor, include job title, total hours, and total dollars;

      (B) The rates charged must be commensurate with the tasks performed (For example, a person performing the task of data entry should not be paid at the rate for performing data analysis);

      (C) The wage rate and benefits shall not exceed two times the hourly wage rate plus benefits provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and

      (D) The applicant must report any familial or business relationship that exists between the applicant and the contractor or employee (Reimbursement may be limited or denied if the contractor or employee is associated to the applicant and they may be considered as one and the same. This includes a separate entity being created by the applicant to conduct research and development. Reimbursement may be limited or denied if the contractor is paid a salary or other compensation);

      (ii) Travel and transportation (One line per event, include the job title, destination, purpose of travel, lodging cost, mileage, air or other identified transportation costs, food and miscellaneous expenses, other costs, and the total cost);

      (iii) Software and computer programming developed specifically to determine appropriate rates, prices, or coverage amounts (Identify the item, include the purpose, and provide receipts or contract or straight-time hourly wage, hours, and total cost. Software developed to send or receive data between the producer, agent, approved insurance provider or RMA or such other similar software may not be included as an allowable cost);

      (iv) Miscellaneous expenses such as postage, telephone, express mail, and printing (Identify the item, cost per unit, number of items, and total dollars); and

      (v) Training costs expended to facilitate implementation of a new approved 508(h) submission (Include instructor(s) hourly rate, hours, and cost of materials and travel) conducted at a national level, directed to all approved insurance providers interested in selling the 508(h) submission, and approved prior to the training by RMA).

      (3) The following expenses are specifically not eligible for research and development and maintenance cost reimbursement:

      (i) Copyright fees, patent fees, or any other charges, costs or expenses related to the use of intellectual property;

      (ii) Training costs, excluding training costs to facilitate implementation of the approved 508(h) submission in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(v);

      (iii) State filing fees and expenses;

      (iv) Normal ongoing administrative expenses or indirect overhead costs (for example, costs associated with the management or general functions of an organization, such as costs for internet service, telephone, utilities, and office supplies);

      (v) Paid or incurred losses;

      (vi) Loss adjustment expenses;

      (vii) Sales commission;

      (viii) Marketing costs;

      (ix) Lobbying costs;

      (x) Product or applicant liability resulting from the research, development, preparation or marketing of the policy;

      (xi) Copyright infringement claims resulting from the research, development, preparation or marketing of the policy;

      (xii) Costs of making program changes as a result of any mistakes, errors or flaws in the policy or plan of insurance;

      (xiii) Costs associated with building rents or space allocation;

      (xiv) Costs in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section determined by the Board to be ineligible for reimbursement; and

      (xv) Local, State, or Federal taxes.

      (g) Requests for reimbursement of maintenance costs must be supported by itemized statements and supporting documentary evidence for each reinsurance year in the maintenance period.

      (1) Actual costs submitted will be examined for reasonableness and may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the Board.

      (2) Maintenance costs for the following activities may be reimbursed:

      (i) Expansion of the original 508(h) submission into additional crops, counties or states;

      (ii) Non-significant changes to the policy and any related material;

      (iii) Non-significant or significant changes to the policy as necessary to protect program integrity or as required by Congress; and

      (iv) Any other activity that qualifies as maintenance.

      (h) Projected costs for research and development for concept proposals shall be based on a detailed estimate of the costs allowed in paragraph (f) of this section. Since costs are one measurement of the viability to develop an efficient policy, the Board may limit reimbursements for research and development to the estimated costs contained in the concept proposal, unless the submitter can justify a higher reimbursement in accordance with Board procedures.

      (i) If a 508(h) submission is determined to be incomplete and is subsequently resubmitted and approved, the costs to perfect the 508(h) submission may not be considered reimbursable costs depending on the level of insufficiency or incompleteness of the 508(h) submission, as determined at the sole discretion of the Board.

      (j) Reimbursement of costs associated with addressing issues raised by the Board, expert reviewers and RMA will be evaluated based on the substance of the issue and the amount of time reasonably necessary to address the specific issue. Delays and additional costs caused by the inability or refusal to adequately address issues may not be considered reimbursable, as determined at the sole discretion of the Board.

      (k) If the Board withdraws its approval for reinsurance at any time during the period that reimbursement for maintenance is being made or user fees are being collected, no maintenance reimbursement shall be made nor any user fee be owed after the date of such withdrawal.

      (l) Not later than 180 days prior to the end of the last reinsurance year in which a maintenance reimbursement will be paid for the approved 508(h) submission, the applicant must notify FCIC in writing regarding its decision on future ownership and maintenance of the policy or plan of insurance.

      (1) The applicant must notify FCIC in writing whether it intends to:

      (i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance and charge approved insurance providers a user fee to cover maintenance expenses for all policies earning premium; or

      (ii) Transfer responsibility for maintenance to FCIC.

      (2) If the applicant fails to notify FCIC in writing by the deadline, the policy or plan of insurance will automatically transfer to FCIC beginning with the next reinsurance year.

      (3) If the applicant elects to:

      (i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance, the applicant must submit a request for approval of the user fee by the Board at the time of the election; or

      (ii) Transfer the policy or plan of insurance to FCIC, FCIC may at its sole discretion, continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance or elect to withdraw the availability of the policy or plan of insurance.

      (4) Requests for approval of the user fee must be accompanied by written documentation to support the amount requested will only cover direct costs to maintain the plan of insurance. Costs that are not eligible for research and development and maintenance reimbursements under this section are not eligible to be considered for determining the user fee.

      (5) The Board will approve the amount of user fee, including the maximum amount of total maintenance that may be collected per year, that is payable to the applicant by approved insurance providers unless the Board determines that the user fee charged:

      (i) Is unreasonable in relation to the maintenance costs associated with the policy or plan of insurance; or

      (ii) Unnecessarily inhibits the use of the policy or plan of insurance by approved insurance providers.

      (6) If the total user fee exceeds the maximum amount determined by the Board, the maximum amount determined by the Board will be divided by the number of policies earning premium to determine the amount to be paid by each approved insurance provider.

      (7) Reasonableness of the initial request to charge a user fee will be determined by the Board based on a comparison of the amount of reimbursement for maintenance previously received, the number of policies, the number of approved insurance providers, and the expected total amount of user fees to be received in any reinsurance year.

      (8) A user fee unnecessarily inhibits the use of a policy or plan of insurance if it is so high that approved insurance providers will not sell the policy, or the user fee represents an unreasonable portion of the A&O subsidy paid to the AIP such that it prevents the AIP from meeting its other obligations under the SRA.

      (9) The user fee charged to each approved insurance provider will be considered payment in full for the use of such policy, plan of insurance or rate of premium for the reinsurance year in which payment is made.

      (10) It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to collect such fees from an approved insurance provider and any indebtedness for such fees must be resolved by the applicant and approved insurance provider.

      (i) Applicants may request that FCIC provide the number of policies sold by each approved insurance provider.

      (ii) Such information will be provided not later than 90 days after such request is made or not later than 90 days after the requisite information has been provided to FCIC by the approved insurance provider, whichever is later.

      (11) Every two years after approval of a user fee, or if the applicant has made a significant change to the approved 508(h) submission, applicants must submit documentation to the Board for review in determining if the user fee should be revised.

      (12) The Board may review the amount of the user fee at any time at its sole discretion.

      (m) The Board may consider information from the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Employment Cost Index, and any other information determined applicable by the Board, in making a determination whether to approve a 508(h) submission for reimbursement of research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees.

      (n) For purposes of this section, rights to, or obligations of, research and development cost reimbursement, maintenance cost reimbursement, or user fees cannot be transferred from any individual or entity unless specifically approved in writing by the Board.

      (o) Applicants requesting reimbursement for research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees, may present their request in person to the Board prior to consideration for approval.

      (p) Index-based weather plans of insurance are not eligible for reimbursement from FCIC for maintenance costs or research and development costs. Submitters of approved index-based weather plans of insurance may collect user fees from other approved insurance providers in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance.

      § 400.713   Non-reinsured supplemental (NRS) policy.

#### § § 400.713

      (a) Unless otherwise specified by FCIC, any NRS policy that covers the same agricultural commodity as any policy reinsured by FCIC under the Act must be provided to RMA to ensure it does not shift any loss or risk that does not exist under the FCIC reinsured policy. Failure to provide such NRS policy or endorsement to RMA prior to its issuance shall result in the denial of reinsurance, A&O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies unless the underlying FCIC policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A&O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.

      (b) An electronic copy in Microsoft Office compatible format, of the new or revised NRS policy and related materials must be submitted at least 150 days prior to the first sales closing date applicable to the NRS policy. At a minimum, examples that demonstrate how liability and indemnities are calculated under differing scenarios must be included. Electronic copies of the NRS must be sent to the Deputy Administrator for Product Management (or successor) at

      (c) RMA will review the NRS policy. If any of the conditions found in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section are found to occur, FCIC will notify the AIP that submitted the NRS policy that if they sell the NRS policy, it will result in denial of reinsurance, A&O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies, unless the underlying FCIC policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A&O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.

      (1) If the NRS policy materially increases or shifts risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC.

      (i) An NRS policy will be considered to materially increase or shift risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC if RMA determines it:

      (A) Creates a moral hazard, such as a financial incentive for the policyholder to behave in a way that increases the number or size of losses;

      (B) Results in the underlying FCIC policy either triggering a loss sooner, or paying a larger indemnity than would otherwise be allowed by the terms and conditions of the underlying reinsured policy; or

      (C) Allows for combined indemnities between the underlying FCIC reinsured policy and the NRS that are in excess of the value a producer would reasonably expect to receive for the insured commodity if a normal crop was produced and sold at a reasonable market price.

      (ii) The NRS must include language that clearly states no indemnity will be paid in excess of the initial value of the insured commodity.

      (2) The NRS reduces or limits the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC. An NRS policy will be considered to reduce or limit the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance if RMA determines it affects, alters, preempts, or undermines the terms or conditions of the underlying policy or procedures issued by FCIC.

      (3) The NRS disrupts the marketplace. An NRS policy will be considered to disrupt the marketplace if RMA determines it encourages planting more acres of the insured commodity in excess of normal market demand, adversely affects the sales or administration of reinsured policies, undermines producers' confidence in the Federal crop insurance program, or harms public perception of the Federal crop insurance program.

      (4) The NRS is an impermissible rebate. An NRS may be considered to be an impermissible rebate if RMA determines that the premium rates charged are insufficient to cover the expected losses and a reasonable reserve or it offers other benefits that are generally provided at a cost.

      (5) The NRS policy is conditioned upon or provides incentive for the purchase of the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC with a specific agent or approved insurance provider.

      (d) RMA will respond not less than 75 days before the first sales closing date or provide notice why RMA is unable to respond within the time frame allotted.

      (e) NRS policies reviewed by RMA will need to be submitted once every five years unless a change is made to the NRS or the underlying policy. Once any changes are made to either policy, or the five year period has concluded, the NRS must be resubmitted for review.

      § 400.766   Basis and applicability.

#### § § 400.766

      (a) The regulations contained in this part prescribe the rules and criteria for obtaining a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation.

      (1) FCIC will provide a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, as applicable, for statutory, regulatory, or other policy provisions or procedures that were in effect during the four most recent crop years from the crop year in which your request was submitted. For example, for a request received in the 2014 crop year, FCIC will consider requests for the 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 crop years.

      (2) If FCIC determines a request is outside the scope of crop years authorized in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you will be notified within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC.

      (3) If the statutory, regulatory or other policy provisions or procedures have changed for the time period you seek an interpretation you must submit a separate request for each policy provision or procedure by year. For example, if you seek an interpretation of section 6(b) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions for the 2012 through 2015 crop years but the policy provisions were revised starting with the 2014 crop year, you must submit two requests, one for the 2012 and 2013 crop years and another for the 2014 and 2015 crop years.

      (b) With respect to a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:

      (1) If there is a dispute between participants that involves a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:

      (i) The parties are required to seek an interpretation of the disputed provision from FCIC in accordance with this subpart (This may require that the parties seek a stay of the proceedings until an interpretation is provided, if such proceedings have been initiated); and

      (ii) The final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may take the form of a written interpretation or, at the sole discretion of FCIC, may take the form of testimony from an employee of RMA expressly authorized in writing to provide interpretations of policy or procedure on behalf of FCIC.

      (2) All written final agency determinations issued by FCIC are binding on all participants in the Federal crop insurance program for the crop years the policy provisions are in effect. All written FCIC interpretations and testimony from an employee of RMA are binding on the parties to the dispute, including the arbitrator, mediator, judge, or NAD.

      (3) Failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation when required by this subpart or failure of NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge to adhere to the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation provided under this subpart will result in the nullification of any award or agreement in arbitration or mediation in accordance with the provisions in the “Mediation, Arbitration, Appeal, Reconsideration, and Administrative and Judicial Review” section or similar section in all crop insurance policies.

      (4) If either party believes an award or decision was rendered by NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge based on a disputed provision in which there was a failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation or NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge's decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision, the party may request FCIC review the matter to determine if a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought in accordance with § 400.767.

      (i) Requests should be submitted through one of the methods contained in § 400.767(a)(1);

      (ii) If FCIC determines that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision:

      (A) The award is automatically nullified; and

      (B) Either party may appeal FCIC's determination that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.

      (5) All written final agency determinations that are published on RMA's website are considered matters of general applicability and are not appealable to NAD. Before obtaining judicial review of any final agency determination, you must obtain an Administrative Final Determination from the Director of NAD on the issue of whether the final agency determination is a matter of general applicability.

      (6) With respect to an administrative review of a FCIC interpretation:

      (i) If either party to the proceeding does not agree with the written FCIC interpretation, a request for administrative review may be filed in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. If you seek an administrative review from FCIC, such request must be submitted in accordance with § 400.767(a).

      (ii) FCIC will not accept requests for administrative review from NAD, a mediator, or arbitrator.

      (iii) The RMA Office of the Deputy Administrator for Product Management will make a determination on the request for administrative review not later than 30 days after receipt of the request.

      (iv) Regardless of whether you have sought administrative review, you may appeal a FCIC interpretation under this subsection to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.

      § 400.767   Requestor obligations.

#### § § 400.767

      (a) All requests for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation submitted under this subpart must:

      (1) Be submitted to the Deputy Administrator using the guidelines provided on RMA's website at  through one of the following methods:

      (i) In writing by certified mail or overnight delivery, to the Deputy Administrator, Risk Management Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, Beacon Facility, Stop 0801, Room 421, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, MO 64141-6205;

      (ii) By facsimile at (816) 926-3049; or

      (iii) By electronic mail at

      (2) State whether you are seeking a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation;

      (3) Identify and quote the specific provision in the Act, regulations, procedure, or policy provision for which you are requesting a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation;

      (4) Contain no more than one request for an interpretation (You must make separate requests for each provision if more than one provision is at issue. For example, if there is a dispute with the interpretation of Paragraph 3 of the Loss Adjustment Manual, then one request for an interpretation is required. If there is a dispute with the interpretation of Paragraph 3 of the Loss Adjustment Manual and Paragraph 2 of the Macadamia Nut Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook, then two separate requests for an interpretation are required);

      (5) State the crop, crop year(s), and plan of insurance applicable to the request;

      (6) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for the request;

      (7) Contain your detailed interpretation of the specific provision of the Act, regulations, procedure, or policy provision for which the request for interpretation is being requested; and

      (8) Not contain any specific facts, alleged conduct, or hypothetical situations or the request will be returned to the requestor without consideration.

      (b) You must advise FCIC if the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation will be used in a judicial review, mediation, or arbitration.

      (1) You must identify the type of proceeding ( mediation, arbitration, or litigation), if applicable, in which the interpretation will be used, and the date the proceeding is scheduled to begin, or the earliest possible date the proceeding would likely begin if a specific date has not been established;

      (2) The name, address, telephone number, and if applicable, fax number, or email address of a contact person for both parties to the dispute;

      (3) Unless the parties elect to use the expedited review process available under the AAA rules or the appeal is before NAD, requests must be submitted not later than 90 days before the date the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding in which the interpretation will be used is scheduled to begin.

      (i) If the rules of the court, mediation, or arbitration require the interpretation prior to the date the proceeding begins, add 90 days to the number of days required prior to the proceeding. For example, if a court requires the interpretation 20 days prior to the date the proceeding begins, you must submit the request 110 days before the proceeding is scheduled to begin.

      (ii) Failure to timely submit a request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may result in:

      (A) FCIC issuing a determination that no interpretation could be made because the request was not timely submitted; and

      (B) Nullification of any agreement or award in accordance with § 400.766 if no final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be provided.

      (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if during the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding, an issue arises that requires a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation the mediator, arbitrator, judge, or magistrate must promptly request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation in accordance with § 400.767(a).

      (4) FCIC at its sole discretion may authorize personnel to provide an oral or written final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, as appropriate; and

      (5) Any decision or settlement resulting from such mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding before FCIC provides its final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be nullified in accordance with § 400.766.

      (c) If multiple parties are involved and have opposing interpretations, a joint request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation including both requestor interpretations in one request is encouraged. If multiple insured persons are parties to the dispute, and the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation applies to all parties, one request may be submitted for all insured persons instead of separate requests for each person. In this case, the information required in this section must be provided for each person.

      § 400.768   FCIC obligations.

#### § § 400.768

      (a) FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation for any request regarding, or that contains, specific factual information to situations or cases, such as acts or failures to act of any participant under the terms of a policy, procedure, or any reinsurance agreement.

      (1) FCIC will not consider specific factual information to situations or cases in any final agency determination or FCIC interpretation.

      (2) FCIC will not consider any examples or hypotheticals provided in your interpretation because those are fact-specific and could be construed as a finding of fact by FCIC. If an example or hypothetical is required to illustrate an interpretation, FCIC will provide the example in the interpretation.

      (b) If, in the sole judgment of FCIC, the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete, FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, but will notify you within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC that the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete.

      (c) If FCIC notifies you that a request is unclear, ambiguous or incomplete under paragraph (b) of this section, the 90-day time period for FCIC to provide a response is stopped on the date FCIC notifies you. On the date FCIC receives a clear, complete, and unambiguous request, FCIC has the balance of the days remaining in the 90-day time period to provide a response to you. For example, FCIC receives a request for a final agency determination on January 10. On February 10, FCIC notifies you the request is unclear. On March 10, FCIC receives a clarified request that meets all requirements for FCIC to provide a final agency determination. FCIC has sixty days from March 10, the balance of the 90-day time period, to provide a response.

      (d) FCIC reserves the right to modify the request if FCIC determines that a request for a final agency determination is really a request for a FCIC interpretation or vice versa.

      (e) FCIC will provide you a written final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation within 90 days of the date of receipt for a request that meets all requirements in § 400.767.

      (f) If FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days of receipt of a request, you may assume your interpretation is correct for the applicable crop year. However, your interpretation shall not be considered generally applicable and shall not be binding on any other program participants. Additionally, in the case of a joint request for a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, if FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days, neither party may assume their interpretations are correct.

      (g) FCIC will publish all final agency determinations as specially numbered documents on the RMA website because they are generally applicable to all program participants.

      (h) FCIC will not publish any FCIC interpretation because it is only applicable to the parties in the dispute. You are responsible for providing copies of the FCIC interpretation to all other parties.

      (i) When issuing a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, FCIC will not evaluate the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster as it relates to their performance of following FCIC policy provisions or procedures. Interpretations will not include any analysis of whether the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster was in compliance with the policy provision or procedure in question.

    § 402.1   General statement.

#### § § 402.1

    The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to implement a catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance that provides a basic level of insurance coverage to protect producers in the event of a catastrophic crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, provided the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the crop insurance policy. This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is a continuous endorsement that is effective in conjunction with a crop insurance policy for the insured crop. Catastrophic risk protection coverage will be offered through approved insurance providers if there are a sufficient number available to service the area. If there are an insufficient number available, as determined by the Secretary, local offices of the Farm Service Agency will provide catastrophic risk protection coverage.

    § 402.2   Applicability.

#### § § 402.2

    This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is applicable to each crop for which catastrophic risk protection coverage is available and for which the producer elects such coverage.

The crops and counties shall be designated by the Manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) from those approved by the Board of Directors of FCIC.

    (b) The insurance is offered through insurance providers reinsured by the FCIC that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for coverage contained in this part and part 402 of this chapter directly to the insured through the Department of Agriculture if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.

    (c) No person may have in force more than one insurance policy issued or reinsured by FCIC on the same crop for the same crop year, in the same county, unless specifically approved in writing by FCIC.

    (d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the FCIC that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.

    (1) If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be without the fault of the person and:

    (i) One contract is an additional coverage policy and the other contract is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy, the additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider, or if not, both insurance providers agree, and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be canceled (If the insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other contract will be canceled); or

    (ii) Both contracts are additional coverage policies or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection policies, the contract with the earliest signature date on the application will be valid and the other contract on that crop in the county for that crop year will be canceled, unless both policies are with the same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees otherwise or both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree otherwise.

    (2) No liability for indemnity or premium will attach to the contracts canceled as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

#### § § 407.8

    (a) Application for insurance, developed in accordance with standards established by FCIC, must be made by any person who wishes to participate in the program in order to cover such person's share in the insured crop as landlord, owner-operator, tenant, or other crop ownership interest.

    (1) No other person's interest in the crop may be insured under the application.

    (2) To obtain coverage, the application must be submitted to the insurance provider on or before the applicable sales closing date on file in the insurance provider's local office.

    (b) FCIC or the insurance provider may reject, no longer accept applications, or cancel existing insurance contracts upon the FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is excessive.

    (b) The insurance is offered through companies reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for the catastrophic level of coverage contained in this part and part 402 directly to the insured through local offices of the Department of Agriculture only if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.

    (c) Except as specified in the Crop Provisions, the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement (part 402 of this chapter) and part 400, subpart T of this chapter, no person may have in force more than one contract on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county.

    (d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.

    (1) If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be without the fault of the person and:

    (i) One contract is an additional coverage policy and the other contract is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy, the additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider, or if not, both insurance providers agree, and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be canceled (If the insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other contract will be canceled); or

    (e) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see § 457.8, paragraph 24).

    (f) An insured whose contract with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation under the Act has been terminated because of violation of the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain multiple peril crop insurance under the Act with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation unless the insured can show that the default in the prior contract was cured prior to the sales closing date of the contract applied for or unless the insured can show that the termination was improper and should not result in subsequent ineligibility.

    (g) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the agent, in writing, at the time of application, of any previous applications for insurance or policies of insurance under the Act and the present status of any such applications or insurance.

    The Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions effective for the 2024 and succeeding crop years in states with a November 30 contract change date and for the 2025 and succeeding crop years in all other states, are as follows:

    (a) Applicability:

    (1) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect the Stage Removal Option.

    (2) You must have an additional coverage policy to elect this option.

    (3) You must elect this option in writing on or before the sales closing date for the first year it is in effect.

    (4) This election is continuous, in accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, unless canceled by the cancellation date. Your election of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for your sugar beets in any crop year will be deemed to be cancellation of this option by you.

    (5) All insurable acreage of sugar beets in the county will be included under this option unless any acreage is specifically excluded by the Special Provisions.

    (b) Insurance Guarantees:

    (1) The production guarantee (per acre) will be the final stage guarantee.

    (2) The terms and conditions contained in sections 3(b) and 3(d) do not apply under this option.

    (c) Premium Adjustment Factor: The premium adjustment factor in the actuarial documents for the stage removal option will apply to the premium computation method in section 7.

    (d) Settlement of Claim:

    (1) The “respective production guarantee” referenced in section 14(b) will be the final stage guarantee.

    (2) The terms and conditions of section 14(c)(1)(iv) do not apply under this option.

    (a) Applicability:

    (1) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect the Early Harvest Adjustment Option to adjust your actual yield(s) for early harvested production.

    (2) You must have additional coverage to elect this option.

    (3) You must elect this option in writing on or before the sales closing date.

    (4) This election is continuous, in accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, unless canceled by the cancellation date. Your election of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for your sugar beets will cancel this option.

    (b) Insurance Guarantees:

    (1) APH database—On or before the production reporting date, you may replace actual yields with early harvest adjusted yields in your APH database, if this option is elected.

    (i) The early harvest adjusted yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.

    (ii) Once an early harvest adjusted yield replaces an actual yield, the early harvest adjusted yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database, this option is canceled in accordance with section 18(a)(4), or the insured chooses to no longer replace that actual yield(s) by the production reporting date.

    (iii) If you cancel the option, the actual yield will be used in the APH database.

    (2) Premium—Your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed. The premium will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the resulting higher yields.

    (3) Adjustment—The adjustment will equal an increase of your actual yield by 1 percent per day for each day the sugar beets were harvested prior to full maturity.

    (4) Threshold—The adjustment will only be made if the early harvested percentage of insured acreage in the unit meets or exceeds 15 percent, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.

    (5) Cap—The adjustment cannot result in a yield greater than the higher of:

    (i) Your approved yield from the unit;

    (ii) The actual yield of the acreage harvested after full maturity from the unit; or

    (iii) The unadjusted actual yield of the early harvested acreage from the unit.

    (6) Processor requirement—The adjustment will only be made if:

    (i) Early harvest is required in the production agreement; or

    (ii) The processor requests early harvest.

    (c) Settlement of Claim—If this option is elected, production to count from the unit will be determined by:

    (1) The adjustment will be made for any early harvested production if the threshold is exceeded for the unit.

    (2) The adjustment will not be made if the sugar beets are damaged by an insurable cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would reduce production.

    (3) If the production agreement does not require early harvest and the processor has not requested early harvest, and the processor:

    (i) Accepts the early harvested production, the early harvested production will be counted but no adjustment will apply.

    (ii) Does not accept the early harvested production, the production to count will be the production guarantee for the acreage harvested early.

    § 457.137   Green pea crop insurance provisions.

#### § § 457.137

    The Green Pea Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2025 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

    In return for your payment of premium and administrative fee for the coverage, these Green Pea Crop Provisions will be attached to and made part of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (Basic Provisions) subject to the terms and conditions in your policy.

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

    The price stipulated in the processor contract for the tenderometer reading, grade factor, or sieve size that is designated in the Special Provisions, if applicable, without regard to discounts or incentives that may apply.

    Land on which production is ready for harvest but the processor elects not to accept such production so it is not harvested.

    (). Separating pods from the vines and, in the case of shell peas, separating the peas from the pod for delivery to the processor.

    Green peas that have matured to the dry form for use as food, feed, or seed.

    In addition to the definition of “good farming practices” in the Basic Provisions, the cultural practices required by the processor contract.

    Shell type and pod type peas that are grown under a processor contract to be canned or frozen and sold for human consumption.

    Combining (vining) of the peas.

    (). A crop planted into the same acreage as another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is grown.

    Green or dry peas.

    In addition to the definition in the Basic Provisions, peas must initially be placed in rows to be considered planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be insurable unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.

    Green peas genetically developed to be eaten without shelling (e.g., snap peas, snow peas, and Chinese peas).

    In addition to the definition of “practical to replant” in the Basic Provisions, practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture availability, and marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant unless the replanted acreage can produce at least 75 percent of the approved yield, and the processor agrees in writing that it will accept the production from the replanted acreage.

    In lieu of the definition of “price election” in the Basic Provisions, price election is defined as the price per pound stated in the processor contract (contracted price) for the tenderometer reading, grade factor, or sieve size contained in the Special Provisions.

    Any business enterprise regularly engaged in canning or freezing green peas for human consumption, that possesses all licenses and permits for processing green peas required by the state in which it operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process contracted green peas within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.

    A written contract between the producer and a processor, containing at a minimum:

    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow green peas, and to deliver the green pea production to the processor;

    (b) The processor's commitment to purchase all the production stated in the processor contract; and

    (c) A base contract price.

    Multiple contracts with the same processor that specify amounts of production will be considered as a single processor contract unless the contracts are for different types of green peas.

    The number of pounds determined by multiplying the approved actual production history yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect. For shell type peas, the weight will be determined after shelling.

    Green peas genetically developed to be shelled prior to eating, canning or freezing.

    (a) For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of production to be delivered:

    (1) In lieu of the definition in the Basic Provisions, a basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to the insured crop in the county that will be used to fulfill contracts with each processor;

    (i) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production contracted with each processor contract;

    (ii) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as production to count if such production is applied to any other basic unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and

    (2) Optional units may be established by:

    (i) Organic and non-organic farming practices as provided in Section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions; or

    (ii) Shell type and pod type for green peas if the shell type acreage does not continue into the pod type acreage in the same rows or planting pattern.

    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates the number of acres to be planted, in addition to or instead of, establishing optional units as provided in Section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, optional units may be established by the shell type and pod type for green peas if the shell type acreage does not continue into the pod type acreage in the same rows or planting pattern.

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) You may select only one price election for all the green peas in the county insured under this policy unless the actuarial documents provide different price elections by type. The percentage of the maximum price election you choose for one type will be applicable to all other types insured under this policy.

    (b) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your approved yield.

    (c) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable cause of loss will be considered to have a zero yield when determining your approved yield.

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are:

    In addition to section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before the acreage reporting date.

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the shell type and pod type green peas in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:

    (1) In which you have a share;

    (2) That are grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements of a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date and are not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the crop year; and

    (3) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):

    (i) Interplanted with another crop;

    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or

    (iii) Planted as a nurse crop.

    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which the green peas are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the processor contract provides for delivery of green peas under specified conditions and at a stipulated base contract price.

    (c) A commercial green pea producer who is also a processor may establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:

    (1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;

    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or officers of the processor must execute and adopt a resolution that contains the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. Such resolution will be considered a processor contract under this policy; and

    (3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

    In addition to section 9 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant; and

    (b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.

    In lieu of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases at the earlier of:

    (a) The date the green peas:

    (1) Were destroyed;

    (2) Should have been harvested but were not harvested;

    (3) Were abandoned; or

    (4) Were harvested;

    (b) The date you harvest sufficient production to fulfill your processor contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific amount of production to be delivered;

    (c) Final adjustment of a loss; or

    (d) September 15 of the calendar year in which the insured green peas would normally be harvested; or

    (e) September 30 of the calendar year in which the insured peas would normally be harvested if you provide notice to us that the insured crop will be harvested as dry peas (see section 11(d)).

    In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:

    (1) Adverse weather conditions, including:

    (i) Excessive moisture that prevents harvesting equipment from entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting equipment; and

    (ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.

    (2) Fire;

    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;

    (4) Plant disease but only on acreage not planted to peas the previous crop year. (In certain instances, in the Special Provisions or in a written agreement, acreage planted to peas the previous year may be covered. Damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures is not covered);

    (5) Wildlife;

    (6) Earthquake;

    (7) Volcanic eruption; or

    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss in section 10(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.

    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:

    (1) Bypassed acreage because of:

    (i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or

    (ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment or;

    (2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor contract.

    In addition to the notices required by section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must give us notice:

    (a) Not later than 48 hours after:

    (1) Total destruction of the green peas on the unit; or

    (2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested production remains.

    (b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us;

    (c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is discovered during the 15-day period or during harvest, so that we may inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay harvest; and

    (d) Prior to the time the green peas would normally be harvested if you intend to harvest the green peas as dry peas.

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:

    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or

    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.

    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:

    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type if applicable;

    (2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;

    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than one type;

    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;

    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than one type;

    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more than one type; and

    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.

    For example:

    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of shell type green peas in the unit, with a guarantee of 4,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.15 per pound. You are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:

    (1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee;

    (2) 400,000 pounds × $0.15 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee;

    (3) Not applicable;

    (4) 200,000 pounds × $0.15 price election = $30,000.00 value of production to count;

    (5) Not applicable;

    (6) $60,000.00−$30,000.00 = $30,000.00 loss; and

    (7) $30,000.00 × 100 percent = $30,000.00 indemnity payment.

    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of pod type green peas in the same unit, with a guarantee of 5,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.15 per pound. You are only able to harvest 450,000 pounds. Your total indemnity for both shell type and pod type green peas would be calculated as follows:

    (1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee for the shell type, and 100 acres × 5,000 pounds = 500,000 pounds guarantee for the pod type;

    (2) 400,000 pounds guarantee × $0.15 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee for the shell type, and 500,000 pounds guarantee × $0.15 price election = $75,000.00 value of guarantee for the pod type;

    (3) $60,000.00 + $75,000.00 = $135,000.00 total value of guarantee;

    (4) 200,000 pounds × $0.15 price election = $30,000.00 value of production to count for the shell type; and 450,000 pounds × $0.15 = $67,500.00 value of production to count for the pod type;

    (5) $30,000.00 + $67,500.00 = $97,500.00 total value of production to count;

    (6) $135,000.00—$97,500.00 = $37,500.00 loss; and

    (7) $37,500.00 loss × 100 percent = $37,500.00 indemnity payment.

    (c) The total production to count, specified in pounds, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:

    (1) All appraised production as follows:

    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:

    (A) That is abandoned;

    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;

    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes or;

    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.

    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.

    (iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.

    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:

    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or

    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested.

    (2) All harvested green pea production from the insurable acreage. The amount of such production will be determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or which should have been paid under the terms of the processor contract for the quality and quantity of the peas delivered to the processor by the base contract price per pound;

    (3) All harvested green pea production from any of your other insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract for this unit; and

    (4) All dry pea production from the insurable acreage if you gave notice in accordance with section 11(d) for any acreage you intended to harvest as dry peas. The harvested or appraised dry pea production will be multiplied by 1.667 for shell types and 3.000 for pod types to determine the green pea production equivalent. No adjustment for quality deficiencies will be allowed for dry pea production.

    A late planting period is not applicable to green peas unless allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready for harvest.

    Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.

#### § § 457.175

    The California Avocado Crop Provisions for the 2026 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

    In return for your payment of premium and administrative fee for the coverage, these California Avocado Crop Provisions will be attached to and made part of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (Basic Provisions) subject to the terms and conditions in your policy.

    CDFA. The California Department of Food and Agriculture.

    Any transaction in which avocados have been inspected under the rules of the CDFA and to which a marketing assessment payment applies under the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research, and Information Act of 2000.

    In lieu of the definition contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, the period of time that begins on December 1 immediately prior to the time the avocado trees normally bloom and that ends on October 31 of the calendar year following such bloom. Crop year is designated by the calendar year following the year in which the avocado trees normally bloom.

    Picking of marketable avocado fruit from the trees or from the ground when permitted as described in section 11(c).

    Your application for crop insurance under these Crop Provisions for the first time and following each time you have cancelled the insurance or the insurance has terminated by action of the policy.

    In lieu of the definition contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, acreage in which two or more crops are planted in any form of an alternating or mixed pattern.

    An avocado fruit that meets the standards published by the CDFA with respect to maturity, defects, size, and weight.

    An avocado fruit that is marketable but that is diverted into processing uses due to visual defects resulting from an insured cause of loss.

    A unit of weight equal to sixteen ounces avoirdupois.

    The root and stem portion of a tree to which a scion can be grafted.

    Twig or portion of a twig of one plant that is grafted onto a rootstock.

    Transplanting a tree into the orchard or grafting a scion onto rootstock.

    A practice whereby the lateral branches of an avocado tree are removed. A portion of the bole also may be removed. The resulting stump is approximately 4 feet or greater in height.

    A term used to designate different varieties of avocados, as more fully described in the Special Provisions.

    (a) Optional units may be established by:

    (1) Organic and non-organic farming practices as provided in section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions;

    (2) Non-contiguous land; or

    (3) Type.

    (b) Optional units by land location as provided in section 34(c)(1) of the Basic Provisions and by irrigation practice as provided in section 34(c)(2) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) You may select only one coverage level for all the avocados in the county insured under this policy.

    (b) You must report, on or before the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by unit:

    (1) Any damage, stumping (including the year or years that the stumping was performed), or removal of trees; change in orchard practices; or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield per acre to less than the approved yield and the number of affected acres and trees;

    (2) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;

    (3) The age of the trees;

    (4) Any acreage excluded under section 6 of these Crop Provisions; and

    (5) For acreage interplanted with another crop:

    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;

    (ii) The planting pattern; and

    (iii) Any other information we request to establish your approved yield per acre.

    (c) We will reduce the approved yield, as necessary, based on your estimate of the effect of any circumstance listed in section 3(b) that may reduce your yields from previous levels. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your approved yield at any time we become aware of the circumstance. If the circumstance occurred:

    (1) Before the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the circumstance was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;

    (2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the approved yield is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or

    (3) Before or after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the approved yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 11(c)(1)(ii) due to uninsured causes. We will reduce your approved yield for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees or in the yield potential of the insured acreage.

    (d) In the event the avocado trees are damaged to the extent that we determine the APH history you certified no longer is representative of the potential production of the unit, we will reduce your approved yield to a level consistent with that reduced potential. Such reduction will not occur for a crop year for which insurance already has attached if the damage is due to a cause of loss that is insurable for the avocado fruit.

    (e) Instead of reporting your production for the current crop year as required by section 3(f)(1) of the Basic Provisions, you are required to report the production for the crop year that ended on the October 31 immediately preceding the cancellation date,  2023 crop year production must be reported by the production reporting date for the 2025 crop year.

    (f) When you initially apply for insurance:

    (1) You must certify your production records for at least the most recently completed crop year;

    (2) If you do not certify your production records for any one or more of the three crop years immediately prior to the most recently completed crop year, you will be assigned a percentage of the transitional yield included in the actuarial documents for that crop year. The percentages will be those described in sections 3 and 5 of the Basic Provisions. All other provisions of sections 3 and 5 of the Basic Provisions apply.

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is the August 31 that precedes the cancellation date.

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are the November 30 immediately prior to the first day of the crop year.

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the avocados in the county grown on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided:

    (1) In which you have a share;

    (2) That is grown for harvest as avocado fruit for commercial sale;

    (3) That is a type identified in the actuarial documents;

    (4) That is irrigated; and

    (5) That is grown on trees that, if inspected, are considered acceptable to us.

    (b) In addition to section 8 of the Basic Provisions that identify an uninsurable crop, we do not insure any avocados produced on trees that have not reached the sixth leaf year unless the unit has produced an average of at least 2,000 pounds of avocados per acre in one of the most recent three crop years or as otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.

    (c) Avocado trees that have been stumped are not insurable for three calendar years after the year stumping was performed. The calendar year stumping occurred will be considered to be the actual calendar year if performed between January 1 and June 30 of that year. It will be considered to be the following calendar year if performed between July 1 and December 31.

    (a) In lieu of that part of section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibits insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, avocados interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements of insurability contained in these Crop Provisions.

    (b) In addition to the acreage designated as not insurable in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure avocados produced on any acreage infected with Phytophthora root rot unless you follow good orchard management practices as recommended by agricultural experts.

    (a) In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions:

    (1) Coverage begins on December 1st of the crop year.

    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the second October 31st of the crop year.

    (b) In addition to section 11 of the Basic Provisions:

    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, and if we inspect and consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.

    (2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any acreage of avocados on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no premium will be due, and no indemnity paid, for such acreage for that crop year unless:

    (i) A transfer of right to an indemnity or a similar form approved by us is completed by all affected parties;

    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and

    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

    (a) In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided against unavoidable loss of production due to the following causes of loss occurring within the insurance period:

    (1) Adverse weather conditions;

    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;

    (3) Insects and disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of control measures;

    (4) Wildlife;

    (5) Earthquake;

    (6) Volcanic eruption; or

    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to an insured cause of loss specified in sections 9(a)(1) through (6).

    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:

    (1) Theft;

    (2) Phytophthora root rot, if you do not maintain cultural practices to minimize the potential for damage due to this pathogen; or

    (3) Inability to market the avocados for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market any avocado fruit due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept such fruit.

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an inspection and appraisal, if needed, that will be used to determine your production to count for such production. If damage occurs after this inspection, we will conduct one or more additional inspections as needed. These inspections, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice as required will result in production to count determined as described in section 11(c) if we are not able to determine the amount of such production;

    (b) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us immediately so we may inspect the unit. You must not sell or otherwise dispose of any damaged production until we have given you written consent to do so, or 15 days, whichever is earlier. If you fail to meet the requirements of this subsection all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count;

    (c) We will not perform any appraisals of potential production earlier than the July that follows the bloom for the crop year; and

    (d) You must notify us immediately if you intend to stump 10 percent or more of the trees on a unit after insurance has attached for the crop year.

    (a) We will determine your loss separately for each unit you defined on your acreage report or that we find to exist in accordance with section 2 of these Crop Provisions. If you do not or cannot provide acceptable records of production for the crop year for:

    (1) Any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such records were not provided; or

    (2) Any basic unit, we will allocate commingled production to each basic unit in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.

    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:

    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;

    (2) Subtracting from the result of section 11(b)(1) the total production to count (see section 11(c));

    (3) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(2) by the price election, by the price election factor, and by your share.

    (c) The total production to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include the value of all appraised and harvested production, as follows:

    (1) Appraised production to be counted will include:

    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:

    (A) That is abandoned;

    (B) That is sold or otherwise disposed by direct marketing if you failed to provide the notice required by section 10 and we were not able to determine the amount of such production;

    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or

    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;

    (ii) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes;

    (iii) Unharvested marketable production (the quantity of such production may be reduced as described in section 11(d));

    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you agree to our appraisal of such production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised production is not reached:

    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. The production to count for such acreage will be based on the greater of the harvested production or our appraisal in accordance with section 15(b) of the Basic Provisions from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the production to count; or

    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the production to count for the acreage will be based on the greater of harvested production or our reappraisal in accordance with section 15(b) of the Basic Provisions if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and

    (2) All marketable harvested production (the quantity of such production may be reduced as described in section 11(d)). Any production that is not marketable due to an insured cause of loss will not be included in the production to count.

    (d) The quantity of appraised and harvested marketable production may be reduced if the production is considered to be a No. 2 avocado and the price of such marketable production is less than 75 percent of the maximum price election. The quantity of such production will be multiplied by an adjustment factor equal to the lesser of 1.00 or the price of the damaged avocados divided by the maximum price election.

    Sections 16 and 17 of the Basic Provisions do not apply to these Crop Provisions.

    You certify production records that support the yields per acre shown below:

    AVERAGE (APPROVED) Yield = 4,417 lbs.

    Assume you selected the 65 percent coverage level. The unit contains 10 acres. The production guarantee per acre is:

    The production guarantee for the unit is:

    § 457.176   Cultivated clam crop insurance provisions.

#### § § 457.176

    The cultivated clam crop provisions for the 2019 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

    FCIC policies:

    For each basic unit, your inventory value multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect, and multiplied by your share. However, for catastrophic risk protection policies, amount of insurance is your inventory value multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect (for CAT coverage the level is limited to 50 percent), multiplied by your share, and multiplied by 55 percent. Your accumulated paid indemnities during the crop year for each basic or optional unit may not exceed your amount of insurance.

    The stage value of all undamaged insurable clams, in the basic unit or, if elected, all optional units combined, immediately prior to the occurrence of any loss as determined by our appraisal. This allows the amount of insurance under the policy to be prorated among the individual units based on the actual value of the clams in the unit at the time of loss. It is also the basis for determining whether or not an indemnity is due. This value is used to ensure that you have not under-reported your clam inventory value.

    A cultivated  (quahog).

    The twelve-month period beginning December 1 and extending through November 30 of the next calendar year, designated by the calendar year in which insurance ends.

    The deductible percentage multiplied by the sum of the inventory values within each basic unit. The crop year deductible will be increased for any increases in the inventory value on the inventory value report. The crop year deductible will be reduced by any previously incurred deductible if you timely report each loss to us.

    An amount equal to 100 percent minus the percent of coverage you select. The percentage is 50 percent for catastrophic risk protection coverage.

    Any pathogen or group of pathogens, parasitic infestation or plague verified by an aquaculture pathologist and shown to be a primary cause to the death of the insured clams.

    The formation of ice in the cells of the animal caused by low air temperatures.

    A space based radio position, navigation, and time transfer system involving satellites and computers to determine the latitude and longitude of a receiver on Earth by computing the time difference for signals from different satellites to reach the receiver and referenced in the Special Provisions.

    A lease parcel, permit or licensed area, whose boundaries are readily discernable above the water, and identified on a map that shows enough detail to distinguish seeded areas within the site.

    A mesh bag used throughout the growing season to contain clams when placed in the appropriate growing medium and as further defined by the Special Provisions.

    Removal of marketable clams from the unit. Clams that are removed from the growing location but not of sufficient size to be marketable are not considered harvested if returned to the growing location.

    Floating ice formed in sheets on the sea surface.

    The total of the stage values from the inventory value report.

    Your report that declares the stage values of insurable clams in accordance with section 6. See the Cultivated Clam Insurance Standards Handbook, Exhibit 5 for the inventory value report completion instructions and form.

    The land under a body of water suitable for planting clams and the column of water above the land if designated and controlled by state law.

    A contract that grants use of land in or assigned to a county for a specified term and for a specified payment and provides the lessee with the exclusive use of the land to plant clams.

    A legally identifiable tract or plot of land covered by a lease, permit, or license.

    Official or legal permission that grants use of land in or assigned to a county for a specified term and provides the licensee with the exclusive use of the land to plant clams.

    In lieu of the definition in the Basic Provisions, separately-named, high-density aquaculture lease sites or shellfish sites are considered non-contiguous, unless limited by the Special Provisions. Individual land parcels within such sites are not considered non-contiguous.

    (a) This deductible allows a smaller deductible than the crop year deductible to be used when:

    (1) Inventory values are less than the reported basic unit value; or

    (2) You have elected optional units, if applicable.

    (b) The occurrence deductible is the lesser of:

    (1) The deductible percentage multiplied by the unit value before loss multiplied by the under-report factor; or

    (2) The crop year deductible.

    A document giving official or legal permission to use land in or assigned to a county for a specified term and provides the permittee with the exclusive use of the land to plant clams.

    The placing of seed clams into the appropriate growing medium for the practice specified.

    The presence in the water of a substance that directly causes death of the clams. The substance shall not be parasitical, bacterial, fungal or viral, or any substance used by you for medicinal purposes. Pollution will also include any increase or decrease in the content of any normal soluble or insoluble constituent of water including mud and silt, feed residues, solid or liquid fish wastes, dissolved gases and any other substance normally present in the water of the lease parcel.

    In lieu of the definition of “Practical to replant” contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, unless limited by the Special Provisions, practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to the causes of loss listed in section 10 of these provisions, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop to develop normally during the remainder of the crop year. Unavailability of seed clams will not be considered a valid reason for failure to replant.

    The cultural methods of producing clams such as trays, mesh bags, round pens, lantern nets or bottom planting.

    Unless limited by the Special Provisions, performing the cultural practices necessary to prepare for replacement of insurable clams that were destroyed by an insurable cause of loss and then placing living insurable clams into mesh bags or pens, or seeding them into prepared growout beds, bottom culture, bottom trays, or floating trays on insurable acreage.

    The dissolved solids (typically salts such as chloride, sodium, and potassium) in ocean water expressed as parts per thousand.

    (a) For clams placed in a field nursery or a nursery bag—a clam that is a minimum of 5 millimeters, measured at the longest shell distance that is parallel to the hinge.

    (b) For all others—a clam which is a minimum of 10 millimeters, measured at the longest shell distance that is parallel to the hinge.

    The submerged subdivided land under a body of water suitable for the cultivation of clams and identified and named separately by the Division of Marine Resources or similar regulatory agency.

    A State or Federal order that prohibits harvesting clams for human food in areas where monitoring program data indicates that fecal material, pathogenic microorganisms, poisonous or deleterious substances, marine toxins, or radio nuclides have reached excessive concentrations.

    Clams that have attained the size or age specified for stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 as defined in the Special Provisions.

    The dollar value of the inventory of all insurable clams at each stage based on the survival factors and the prices shown in the actuarial documents for such stages, in each unit on your inventory value report, including any revision that increases the value of your insurable inventory.

    A significant increase or decrease in water depth relative to normal tides that is caused by a strong, continuous and prolonged strong flow of onshore or offshore winds.

    A factor shown on the actuarial documents that represents the expected percentage of clams that will normally survive. If you provide production records for three consecutive years, your records will be used in lieu of the factor contained in the actuarial document to determine the survival factor. The survival factor is applied at the time of inventory and is not applied a second time to the same inventory when a loss occurs. Clams that are seeded subsequent to the annual inventory value report must be adjusted by the survival factor.

    A large water wave, wave train, or a series of waves, generated in a body of water by an impulsive disturbance that vertically displaces the water column or a destructive type of wave motion in seas and oceans, associated with either strong winds or underwater earthquakes.

    The factor that adjusts your indemnity for under-reporting of inventory values. The factor is always used in determining any indemnities. The under-report factor is the lesser of: (a) 1.000; or (b) the sum of all stage values reported on all the inventory value reports, minus the total of all previous losses, as adjusted by any previous under-reporting factors, divided by the basic unit value before loss.

    The value of the remaining insurable clams in each basic or optional unit based on the percentage of the reference maximum dollar amount contained in the actuarial documents, immediately following the occurrence of a loss as determined by our appraisal, plus any reduction in value due to uninsured causes. This is used to determine the loss of value for each individual unit so that losses can be paid on an individual unit basis, optional or basic, as applicable.

    The stage value of undamaged insurable clams in the basic or optional unit, as applicable, immediately prior to the loss occurrence. The determined value will include the number of seeded and harvested clams and stages that existed on the date of the inventory value report, adjusted for changes in accordance with subparagraph 22A(2) of the Insurance Standards Handbook, including but not limited to; the reference maximum dollar amount contained in the actuarial documents; and the applicable survival factors. This allows the amount of insurance under the policy to be divided among the individual units in accordance with the value of the clams in the unit at the time of loss for determining whether you are entitled to an indemnity for insured losses in the unit, optional or basic, as applicable. Clams that are seeded subsequent to the annual inventory value report being submitted must be adjusted by the survival factor before they are added to the beginning inventory during the process of establishing the “_Unit value before loss._”

    (a) In addition to the definition of basic unit contained in section 1 of the Basic

    Provisions, a basic unit may be divided into optional units in accordance with section 2(b). Note that even if you elect optional unit coverage, amount of insurance, crop year deductible, under-report factor, premium, and the total amount of indemnity payable under this policy will be controlled by the basic unit value before loss.

    (b) If you elect the additional level of coverage, for an additional premium, inventory that would otherwise be a basic unit may, unless limited by the Special Provisions, be divided into optional units by non-contiguous lease parcels. Additional optional units may also be authorized in the Special Provisions. If you elect optional units, you must provide separate inventory reports for each unit and keep all records of seeding, harvest, and uninsured losses separately by unit.

    (c) Failure to keep or report separate records will result in all optional unit inventories under a basic unit being combined in a basic unit at loss time.

    (d) If you elect optional units, your amount of insurance will be divided among optional units in relation to unit value before loss of clams in each optional unit. If, at the time of loss, the aggregate value of the clams in your optional units exceeds your basic unit inventory value, you will be subject to the under-report factor provisions.

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may only select one coverage level percentage for all clams, regardless of their stage, insured under this policy.

    (b) Your amount of insurance will be reduced by the amount of any indemnity paid under this policy.

    (c) For an additional premium, you may increase your amount of insurance in accordance with section 6(d).

    (d) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

    (e) For seeded clams, the amount of insurance is the product of the reference maximum dollar amount of insurance and the fraction of the maximum value associated with the applicable stage multiplied by the coverage level selected multiplied by your share.

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is August 31 of each year, or as specified in the actuarial documents.

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are November 30, or as specified in the actuarial documents.

    In lieu of section 6 of the Basic Provisions:

    (a) For insurance to attach for the crop year, you must submit an inventory value report to us with your application and for each subsequent crop year, not later than November 30 preceding the crop year, or by the date specified in the Special Provisions.

    (b) The inventory value report must be submitted yearly and include, for each basic or optional unit all growing locations, the stages of the clams and the stage values, and your share by growing location.

    (1) The inventory value must also reflect the stages as shown in the Special Provisions.

    (2) At our option and at any time, you may be required to provide documentation in support of any of your reports, including, but not limited to, a detailed listing of growing locations, unit values, the numbers and the sizes of clams seeded or placed for grow-out; your share, sales of clams and purchases of seed clams for the 3 previous crop years, and of your ability to properly obtain and maintain clams.

    (3) For catastrophic level policies only, you must report your clam sales for the previous crop year on the clam inventory value report. You may be required to provide documentation to support such sales.

    (c) Your inventory value report, including any revised report, will be used to determine your premium and amount of insurance.

    (d) If allowed for in the Special Provisions you may revise your inventory value report to increase the reported inventory value. We may inspect the inventory. Your revised inventory value report, if allowed by the Special Provisions, will be considered accepted by us and coverage will begin on any proposed increase in inventory value at the later of December 1, the date shown in the Special Provisions, or 30 days after your written request is received by us, unless we reject the proposed increase in your inventory value in writing. We will reject any requested increase if a loss occurs before the later of December 1, the date shown in the Special Provisions, or within 30 days of the date the request is made.

    (e) Failure to report the full value of your stage value will result in the reduction of any claim in accordance with section 14(d).

    (f) For catastrophic insurance coverage only: Your inventory value report for all clams cannot exceed the lesser of the value from section 6(b) or the percent shown on the actuarial documents of your previous year's sales of clams unless you provide acceptable records to prove your actual inventory value.

    (g) Your inventory value report must reflect your insurable clam inventory according to the prices contained in the actuarial documents. In no instance will we be liable for values greater than those contained in the actuarial documents.

    (h) You must report all clams on the unit including any clams owned or subleased by other individuals or entities.

    (i) No application or inventory value reports, except revisions, will be accepted after November 30, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.

    (a) In lieu of section 7(c) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine your premium by multiplying the amount of insurance by the appropriate premium rate and by the premium adjustment factors listed on the actuarial documents.

    (b) Additional premium from an increase in the inventory value report is due and payable when we accept the revised inventory value report.

    (c) In addition to the provisions in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, the premium will be adjusted for partial crop years for the year of seeding and for clam leases you acquire. Premium will be charged for the entire month, as shown in the actuarial documents, for any month during which any amount of coverage is provided.

    In lieu of the provisions of section 8 and section 9 of the Basic Provisions, the insured crop is all the clams in the county that:

    (a) Meet all the requirements for insurability and for which prices are provided in the actuarial documents;

    (b) Are acceptable to us;

    (c) Are grown by a person, who in at least three of the five previous crop years:

    (1) Grew clams for commercial sale; and

    (2) Participated in the management of a clam farming operation by at least exercising decision-making authority over all operational aspects of the farm.

    (d) Are grown in a county for which a premium rate is provided in the actuarial documents;

    (e) Are in a growing location acceptable to us and for which you provided GPS coordinates with your clam inventory value report in accordance with the Special Provisions; and

    (f) Use a practice that fixes the insurable clams to the land within the growing location.

    (a) In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, coverage begins the later of:

    (1) The date the pre-acceptance inspection, if applicable, is complete unless we notify you that your inventory is not insurable; or

    (2) If your inventory is insurable:

    (i) On December 1 for new applications, when the application and the inventory value report are submitted by October 30;

    (ii) On the 31st day following the date of submission for new applications, when the application and the inventory value report are submitted between November 1 and 30;

    (iii) On December 1 for policies continued from the prior year if the inventory value report is submitted by October 30;

    (iv) On the 31st day following the date of submission of the inventory value report for policies continued from the prior year when the inventory value report is submitted between November 1 and 30; and

    (v) However, you acquire a financial interest in any insurable clams after coverage begins, but after December 1 of the crop year, and our inspection determines that the clams are acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such clams 30 days after a revised inventory report is accepted by us indicating the stage value of the acquired clams; or

    (vi) On the date contained in the Special Provisions.

    (b) Insurance ends at the earliest of:

    (1) The date of final adjustment of a loss when the total indemnities due equal the amount of insurance;

    (2) November 30; or

    (3) A date specified in the Special Provisions. (c) Insurance ceases immediately on any clams removed from the unit.

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided for the death of clams caused only by the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period unless otherwise limited by the Special Provisions:

    (1) Oxygen depletion due to vegetation, microbial activity, harmful algae bloom, or high water temperature unless otherwise limited by the Special Provisions;

    (2) Disease, if medication does not exist for control of the disease;

    (3) Freeze;

    (4) Hurricane;

    (5) Decrease in salinity associated with a weather event verified by National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or United States Geologic Survey (USGS) or as otherwise defined in the Special Provisions;

    (6) Tidal wave;

    (7) Storm surge that is associated with a local weather event and verified by NOAA or USGS; or

    (8) Ice floe.

    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we do not insure against any loss caused by:

    (1) Your inability to market clams as a direct result of quarantine, shellfish harvest ban, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;

    (2) Collapse or failure of buildings or structures;

    (3) Loss of market value;

    (4) Vandalism;

    (5) Theft;

    (6) Pollution;

    (7) Predation (unless allowed by the Special Provisions);

    (8) Dredging;

    (9) Any cause of loss that occurred prior to or after the insurance period;

    (10) Any unexplained shortages or disappearance of inventory; or

    (11) Failure of the clam to grow to a marketable size.

    Unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions:

    (a) In accordance with the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed for insurable clams if death of the clams was due to an insurable cause of loss.

    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment will be the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by multiplying the replanting payment amount contained in the Special Provisions by your insured share.

    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of the Basic Provisions, only one replanting payment will be made per lease parcel planted within the crop year.

    (d) You may not collect a replant payment and an indemnity for the same loss.

    In addition to your duties contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions,

    (a) You must obtain our written consent prior to changing or discontinuing your normal practices with respect to care and maintenance of the insured clams. Failure to obtain our written consent will result in the denial of your claim.

    (b) If you are claiming disease as the cause of loss, you must prove at your own expense that the death of the clams was due to disease by isolating a sample of the clams and identifying the disease following histological or pathological examination conducted by a veterinarian who is a certified fish pathologist or a person approved by us.

    In addition to the requirements of section 21 of the Basic Provisions, you must permit us to inspect the insurable clams at any time and take samples of damaged and undamaged clams for inspection, testing, and analysis, and examine and make copies of your records.

    We will determine indemnities for any unit as follows:

    (a) Determine the under-report factor for the basic unit;

    (b) Determine the occurrence deductible;

    (c) Subtract unit value after loss from unit value before loss;

    (d) Multiply the result of 14(c) by the under-report factor;

    (e) Subtract the occurrence deductible from the result in section 14(d); and

    (f) If the result of section 14(e) is greater than zero, and subject to the limit of section 14(g);

    (1) For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, your indemnity equals the result of section 14(e), multiplied by your share.

    (2) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, your indemnity equals the result of section 14(e) multiplied by 55 percent, multiplied by your share.

    (g) The total of all indemnities for the crop year will not exceed the amount of insurance.

    Provisions of section 16 of the Basic Provisions do not apply.

    Provisions of section 17 of the Basic Provisions do not apply.

    Assume you have a 100 percent share, the inventory value reported by you is $100,000, and your coverage level is 75 percent. Your amount of insurance is $75,000 ($100,000 × .75). At the time of loss, unit value before loss is $95,000, unit value after loss is $30,000 and basic unit value before loss is $100,000. The deductible percentage is 25 percent (100−75), the crop year deductible is $25,000 (.25 × $100,000). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:

    Step (1) Determine the under-report factor; $100,000 ÷ $95,000 = 1.000;

    Step (2) Determine the occurrence deductible; .25 × $95,000 × 1.000 = $23,750;

    Step (3) Calculate the difference between unit value before loss and unit value after loss; $95,000−$30,000 = $65,000;

    Step (4) Result of step 3 multiplied by the underreport factor (step 1); $65,000 × 1.000 = $65,000;

    Step (5) Result of step 4 minus the occurrence deductible; $65,000−$23,750 = $41,250;

    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share; $41,250 × 1.000 = $41,250 indemnity payment.

    Assume you have a 100 percent share, the inventory value reported by you is $100,000, and your coverage level is 75 percent. You have two optional units, unit 1 and unit 2. Your amount of insurance is $75,000 ($100,000 × .75). You have a loss on unit 1 and no loss on unit 2. At the time of loss, unit value before loss on unit 1 is $60,000, unit value after loss on unit 1 is $18,000 and basic unit value before loss is $125,000. The deductible percentage is 25 percent (100−75), the crop year deductible is $25,000 (.25 × $100,000). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:

    Step (1) Determine the under-report factor; $100,000 ÷ $125,000 = .80;

    Step (2) Determine the occurrence deductible; .25 × $60,000 × .80 = $12,000;

    Step (3) Calculate the difference between unit value before loss and unit value after loss; $60,000−$18,000 = $42,000;

    Step (4) Result of step 3 multiplied by the underreport factor (step 1); $42,000 × .80 = $33,600;

    Step (5) Result of step 4 minus the occurrence deductible; $33,600−$12,000 = $21,600;

    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share; $21,600 × 1.000 = $21,600 indemnity payment.

    Your crop year deductible is reduced to $13,000 ($25,000−$12,000). Your amount of insurance is reduced to $53,400 ($75,000−$21,600). You do not restock unit 1 after the first loss. Values on unit 2 do not change from those measured at the time of the loss on unit 1. Assume you have a loss later in the crop year on unit 2. Unit value before loss on unit 2 is $65,000, unit value after loss on unit 2 is $0.00 and basic unit value before loss on the basic unit is $83,000. Your loss would be determined as follows:

    Step (1) Determine the remaining amount of insurance; $100,000−$33,600 = $66,400;

    Step (2) Determine the under-report factor; $66,400 ÷ $83,000 = .800;

    Step (3) Determine the occurrence deductible; $25,000−$12,000 = $13,000;

    Step (4) Calculate the difference between unit value before loss and unit value after loss; $65,000−$0.00 = $65,000;

    Step (5) Result of step 4 multiplied by the underreport factor (step 2); $65,000 × .800 = $52,000;

    Step (6) Result of step 5 minus the occurrence deductible; $52,000−$13,000 = $39,000;

    Step (7) Result of step 6 multiplied by your share; $39,000 × 1.000 = $39,000 indemnity payment.

      § 460.11   Calculating PCCP amounts for first insured crops.

#### § § 460.11

      (a) For the 2022 crop year, for eligible insured acres covered under a crop insurance policy for a first insured crop, the amount of premium support under PCCP for each insured acre will be $5, calculated on a CLU basis, with a maximum equal to the amount of premium owed by the insured.

      (b) For the 2022 crop year, in states administering a cover crop program providing premium subsidy under an active MOU with RMA, as authorized by Section 508(c)(8) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, insured acres qualifying for a state premium subsidy amount are eligible for a matching amount under PCCP, calculated on a CLU basis, which may be in addition to the amount in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (1) The matching amount under PCCP per insured acre will be equal to the state contribution per insured acre on a CLU basis.

      (2) The matching amount under PCCP per insured acre will be limited by the amount of premium owed by the insured on a CLU basis. If limited, the state contribution amount and matching PCCP amount will be reduced proportionately on a CLU basis.

      (c) Amounts under PCCP are limited to the full amount of premium owed by the insured for the eligible insured acres on a CLU basis. If the full amount under PCCP would result in a negative premium balance for the insured on a CLU basis, PCCP amounts will be limited to the full amount of premium owed on a CLU basis, with the amount calculated in paragraph (b) of this section being applied first and the amount calculated in paragraph (a) of this section being applied second.

      (1) In cases where insureds are eligible for both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and premium owed on a CLU basis is less than the amount in paragraph (b) of this section, the state contribution amount and matching PCCP amount in paragraph (b) of this section will be reduced proportionally on a CLU basis, and there will be no PCCP premium support amount applied in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (2) In cases where insureds are eligible for both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and premium owed on a CLU basis is greater than the amount in paragraph (b) of this section but less than the sum of the amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, there will be no reduction to the state contribution amount and matching PCCP amount in paragraph (b) of this section, and the PCCP premium support amount in paragraph (a) of this section will be reduced.

      (d) If the eligible insured acres are adjusted or revised for any reason, such as an overreporting of insured acres, the amount under PCCP will be based on the eligible insured acres after any such amendment.

      § 460.12   Calculating PCCP amounts for WFRP.

#### § § 460.12

      (a) For the 2022 crop year, for eligible WFRP acres, the amount of premium support under PCCP for each acre will be $5, with a maximum equal to the amount of WFRP premium owed by the insured.

      (b) PCCP amounts for WFRP are limited to the full amount of premium owed by the insured for the WFRP policy. If the full amount under PCCP would result in a negative premium balance for the insured, PCCP amounts will be limited to the full amount of premium owed.

      (c) If the eligible WFRP acres are adjusted or revised for any reason, such as an overreporting of planted cover crop acres, the amount under PCCP will be based on the eligible WFRP acres after any such amendment.

      § 460.13   Accounting for PCCP amounts.

#### § § 460.13

      (a) The amount under PCCP will not be paid directly to eligible producers. FCIC and AIPs will account for the amount when calculating total producer premium due. AIPs will adjust participant bills accordingly. All bills follow the same terms and conditions specified in the crop insurance policy, regardless of PCCP amounts.

      (b) PCCP premium support will be provided via premium billing adjustments by the applicable RMA premium billing date for the insured crop.

      (c) PCCP premium support is available both for eligible insured acres and for eligible WFRP acres associated with the same planted acreage of qualifying cover crops.

      (d) The payment limitations in 7 CFR 760.1507 are not applicable to PCCP.

      (e) RMA will obtain cover crop records from FSA and determine eligibility such that eligible producers do not need to take any additional specific action through their crop insurance agent to enroll in the PCCP.

      (1) In the event that any PCCP amount is determined to be incorrect, the amount will be recalculated until the 2022 reinsurance year annual settlement date of October 6, 2023, unless otherwise specified by the RMA Administrator.

      (2) After October 6, 2023, the amount will be final except in cases of misrepresentation, fraud, scheme, or device.
