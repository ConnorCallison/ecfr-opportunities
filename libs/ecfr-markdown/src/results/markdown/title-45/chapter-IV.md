#### § § 400.45

      This section applies to a State's RCA program that follows the State's rules under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under title IV-A of the Social Security Act, prior to amendment by Public Law 104-33. A State must continue to apply these rules to its RCA program until it implements a new RCA program under § 400.56 or § 400.65. A State that receives an approved waiver under § 400.300 to continue an AFDC-type RCA program must follow the rules in this section.

      (a)  The State agency must comply with regulations at § 233.20(a)(13) of this title governing recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments in the AFDC program.

      (b)  (1) A State must provide any individual wishing to do so, an opportunity to apply for cash assistance and must determine the eligibility of each applicant.

      (2) In determining eligibility for cash assistance, the State must—

      (i) Comply with the regulations at part 206 of this title governing applications, determinations of eligibility, and furnishing assistance under public assistance programs, as applicable to the AFDC program;

      (ii) Determine eligibility for other cash assistance programs in accordance with § 400.51; and

      (iii) Comply with regulations at §§ 400.54(a)(3) and 400.68.

      (c) —A State must comply with the regulations at § 400.52.

      (d) —A State must comply with the regulations at § 400.53.

      (e)  In considering the income and resources of applicants for and recipients of refugee cash assistance, the State agency must:

      (1) Apply the regulations at § 233.20(a)(3) through (2) of this title for considering income and resources of AFDC applicants; and

      (2) Apply the regulations at § 400.66(b) through (d).

      (f)  (1) In determining need for refugee cash assistance, a State agency must use the State's AFDC need standards established under § 233.20(a)(1) and (2) of this title.

      (2) In determining the amount of the refugee cash assistance payment to an eligible refugee who meets the standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and applying the consideration of income and resources in paragraph (e) of this section and in § 400.66(b) through (d), a State must pay 100 percent of the payment level which would be appropriate for an eligible filing unit of the same size under the AFDC program.

      (3) The State agency may use the date of application as the date refugee cash assistance begins in order to provide payments quickly to newly arrived refugees.

      (g) —If a State prorated allowances for shelter, utilities, and similar needs in its AFDC program under § 233.20(a)(5) of this title, it must prorate such allowances in the same manner in its refugee assistance programs.

      (h) —In administering the program of refugee cash assistance, the State agency must also apply the following AFDC regulations in this title:

      233.31 Budgeting methods for AFDC.

      233.32 Payment and budget months (AFDC).

      233.33 Determining eligibility prospectively for all payment months (AFDC).

      233.34 Computing the assistance payment in the initial one or two months (AFDC).

      233.35 Computing the assistance payment under retrospective budgeting after the initial one or two months (AFDC).

      233.36 Monthly reporting (AFDC)—which shall apply to recipients of refugee cash assistance who have been in the United States more than 6 months.

      233.37 How monthly reports are treated and what notices are required (AFDC).

      235.110 Fraud.

      This subpart sets forth requirements concerning grants to States under section 412(e) of the Act for refugee cash assistance (RCA). Sections 400.48 through 400.55 apply to both public/private RCA programs and publicly-administered RCA programs.

      § 400.49   Recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments.

#### § § 400.49

#### § § 400.50

      (a) A State or its designee agency(s) must provide any individual wishing to do so, an opportunity to apply for cash assistance and must determine the eligibility of each applicant as promptly as possible within no more than 30 days from the date of application.

      (b) A State or its designee agency(s) must inform applicants about the eligibility requirements and the rights and responsibilities of applicants and recipients under the program.

      (c) In determining eligibility for cash assistance, the State or its designee agency(s) must promptly refer elderly or disabled refugees and refugees with dependent children to other cash assistance programs to apply for assistance in accordance with § 400.51.

      § 400.51   Determination of eligibility under other programs.

#### § § 400.51

      (a)  For refugees determined ineligible for cash assistance under the TANF program, the State or its designee must determine eligibility for refugee cash assistance in accordance with §§ 400.53 and 400.59 in the case of the public/private RCA program or §§ 400.53 and 400.66 in the case of a publicly-administered RCA program.

      (b) —(1)  (i) The State agency or its designee must refer refugees who are 65 years of age or older, or who are blind or disabled, promptly to the Social Security Administration to apply for cash assistance under the SSI program.

      (ii) If the State agency or its designee determines that a refugee who is 65 years of age or older, or blind or disabled, is eligible for refugee cash assistance, it must furnish such assistance until eligibility for cash assistance under the SSI program is determined, provided the conditions of eligibility for refugee cash assistance continue to be met.

      (2) OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD. In Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—

      (i) Eligibility for cash assistance under the OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD program must be determined for refugees who are 65 years or older, or who are blind or disabled; and

      (ii) If a refugee who is 65 years of age or older, or blind or disabled, is determined to be eligible for refugee cash assistance, such assistance must be furnished until eligibility for cash assistance under the OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD program is determined, provided the conditions of eligibility for refugee cash assistance continue to be met.

      § 400.52   Emergency cash assistance to refugees.

#### § § 400.52

      If the State agency or its designee determines that a refugee has an urgent need for cash assistance, it should process the application for cash assistance as quickly as possible and issue the initial payment to the refugee on an emergency basis.

      § 400.53   General eligibility requirements.

#### § § 400.53

      (a) Eligibility for refugee cash assistance is limited to those who—

      (1) Are new arrivals who have resided in the U.S. less than the RCA eligibility period determined by the ORR Director in accordance with § 400.211;

      (2) Are ineligible for TANF, SSI, OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD programs;

      (3) Meet immigration status and identification requirements in subpart D of this part or are the dependent children of, and part of the same family unit as, individuals who meet the requirements in subpart D, subject to the limitation in § 400.208 with respect to nonrefugee children; and

      (4) Are not full-time students in institutions of higher education, as defined by the Director.

      (b) A refugee may be eligible for refugee cash assistance under this subpart during a period to be determined by the Director in accordance with § 400.211.

      § 400.54   Notice and hearings.

#### § § 400.54

      (a)  (1) A written notice must be sent or provided to a recipient at least 10 days before the date upon which refugee cash assistance will be reduced, suspended, or terminated.

      (2) In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the written notice must clearly state the action that will be taken, the reasons for the action, and the right to request a hearing.

      (3) In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the State or its designee agency(s) must specify the program(s) to which the notice applies, clearly distinguishing between RCA and other assistance programs. For example, in the case of a publicly-administered program, if a refugee applies for assistance and is determined ineligible for TANF but eligible for refugee cash assistance, the notice to the applicant must specify clearly the determinations with respect both to TANF and to refugee cash assistance. When a recipient of refugee cash assistance is notified of termination because of reaching the time limit on such assistance, the State or its designee must review the case file to determine possible eligibility for TANF or GA due to changed circumstances and the notice to the recipient must indicate the result of that determination as well as the termination of RCA.

      (b)  All applicants for and recipients of refugee cash assistance must be provided an opportunity for a hearing to contest adverse determinations. States must ensure that hearings meet the due process standards in  v.  397 U.S. 254 (1970).

      (1)  The State must specify in the public/private RCA plan the hearing procedures to be used in the RCA program. The plan may specify that the local resettlement agency(s) will refer all hearing requests to a State-administered hearing process. If the plan does not specify the use of a State-administered hearing process, then the procedures to be followed must include:

      (i) The State or local resettlement agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA must provide an applicant for or recipient of refugee cash assistance an opportunity for an oral hearing to contest adverse determinations. Hearings must be conducted by an impartial official or designee of the State or local resettlement agency who has not been involved directly in the initial determination of the action in question.

      (ii) The State must ensure that procedures are established to provide refugees a right of final appeal for an in-person hearing provided by an impartial, independent entity outside of the local resettlement agency.

      (iii) Final administrative action must be taken within 60 days from the date of a request for a hearing.

      (2)  The State must specify in the State Plan referenced in § 400.4 the public agency hearing procedures it intends to use in the RCA program.

      (3) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, the written notice of any hearing determination must adequately explain the basis for the decision and the refugee's right to request any further administrative or judicial review.

      (4) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a refugee's benefits may not be terminated prior to completion of final administrative action, but are subject to recovery by the agency if the action is sustained.

      (5) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is an incorrect grant computation.

      (6) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when assistance is terminated because the eligibility time period imposed by law has been reached, unless there is a disputed issue of fact that is unresolved by the process in § 400.23.

      § 400.55   Availability of agency policies.

#### § § 400.55

      A State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, must make available to refugees the written policies of the RCA program, including agency policies regarding eligibility standards, the duration and amount of cash assistance payments, the requirements for participation in services, the penalties for non-cooperation, and client rights and responsibilities to ensure that refugees understand what they are eligible for, what is expected of them, and what protections are available to them. The State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, must ensure that agency policy materials and all notices required in §§ 400.54, 400.82, and 400.83, are made available in written form in English and in appropriate languages where a significant number or proportion of the recipient population needs information in a particular language. In regard to refugee language groups that constitute a small number or proportion of the recipient population, the State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, at a minimum, must use an alternative method, such as verbal translation in the refugee's native language, to ensure that the content of the agency's policies is effectively communicated to each refugee.

      § 400.56   Structure.

#### § § 400.56

      (a) States may choose to enter into a partnership agreement with local resettlement agencies for the operation of a public/private RCA program. Sections 400.56 through 400.63 apply to the public/private RCA program.

      (b) The public/private RCA program must be administered by the State through contracts or grants with local resettlement agencies or a lead resettlement agency that provides initial resettlement services under the terms of the Department of State Cooperative Agreement for Reception and Placement.

      (c) The public/private RCA program must be statewide, unless the State determines that it is not in the best interests of refugees to provide a public/private RCA program in a particular area of the State.

      (d) Local resettlement agencies may be responsible for determining eligibility, and authorizing and providing payments to eligible refugees.

      (e) States and local resettlement agencies may not propose to operate a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program in the same geographic location.

      (f) States must ensure the provision of RCA assistance to eligible refugees in the State who are sponsored by local resettlement agencies in bordering states, where applicable.

      § 400.57   Planning and consultation process.

#### § § 400.57

      A State that wishes to establish a public/private RCA program must engage in a planning and consultation process with the local agencies that resettle refugees in the State to develop a public/private RCA plan in accordance with the requirements under § 400.58.

      (a) Primary participants in the planning process must include representatives of the State and each local agency that resettles refugees in the State. During the planning process, the State must fully consult with representatives of counties, refugee mutual assistance associations (MAAs), local community services agencies, national voluntary agencies that resettle refugees in the State, representatives of each refugee ethnic group, and other agencies that serve refugees.

      (b) Each local resettlement agency that resettles refugees in the State must inform its national resettlement agency of the proposed public/private RCA program and must obtain a letter of agreement from the national agency that indicates that the national agency supports the public/private RCA plan and will continue to place refugees in the State under the public/private RCA program.

      § 400.58   Content and submission of public/private RCA plan.

#### § § 400.58

      (a) States and local resettlement agencies must develop a public/private RCA plan which describes how the State and local resettlement agencies will administer and provide refugee cash assistance to eligible refugees. The plan must describe the agreed-upon public/private RCA program including:

      (5) A description of how all RCA eligible refugees residing in the State will have reasonable access to cash assistance and services;

      (6) A description of the procedures to be used to ensure appropriate protections and due process for refugees, such as the correction of underpayments, notice of adverse action and the right to mediation, a pre-dermination hearing, and an appeal to an independent entity;

      (7) A description of proposed exemptions from participation in employability services;

      (8) A description of the employment and self-sufficiency services to be provided to RCA recipients by—

      (i) Local resettlement agencies under contract or grant, and/or

      (ii) Other refugee services providers;

      (9) Procedures for providing RCA to eligible secondary migrants who move to the State, including secondary migrants who were sponsored by a local resettlement agency that does not have a presence in the receiving State;

      (10) If applicable, provisions for providing assistance to refugees resettling in the State who are sponsored by a local resettlement agency in a bordering State which does not have an office in the State of resettlement;

      (11) A description of the procedures to be used to safeguard the disclosure of information regarding refugee clients;

      (12) Letters of agreement from the national voluntary resettlement agencies that indicate support for the proposed public/private RCA program and indicate that refugee placements in the State will continue under the public/private RCA program;

      (13) A breakdown of the proposed program and administrative costs of both the cash assistance and service components of the public/private RCA program, including any per capita caps on administrative costs only if a State proposes to use such caps; and

      (14) The proposed implementation date for the State's public/private RCA program;

      (b) In cases where the State, after consultation with the local resettlement agencies in the State, determines that a public/private RCA program is not feasible statewide and proposes to implement a public/private RCA program in only a portion of the State and to operate a publicly-administered RCA program in the balance of the State, the State's RCA plan must include the information required in § 400.65(b).

      (c) The plan must be signed by the Governor or his or her designee.

      (d) The Director of ORR will follow the procedures in § 400.8 for the approval of public/private RCA plans. An approved public/private RCA plan will be incorporated into the refugee program State Plan.

      (e) Any amendments to the public/private RCA plan must be developed in consultation with the local resettlement agencies and must be submitted to ORR in accordance with § 400.8. The Director of ORR will follow the procedures in § 400.8 for approval of amendments to public/private RCA plans.

      § 400.59   Eligibility for the public/private RCA program.

#### § § 400.59

      (a) Eligibility for refugee cash assistance under the public/private program is limited to those who meet the income eligibility standard established by the State after consultation with local resettlement agencies in the State.

      (b) Any resources remaining in the applicant's country of origin may not be considered in determining income eligibility.

      (c) A sponsor's income and resources may not be considered to be accessible to a refugee solely because the person is serving as a sponsor.

      § 400.60   Payment levels.

#### § § 400.60

For family units greater than 4 persons, the payment ceiling may be increased by $70 for each additional person.

      (b) States and local resettlement agencies may not make payments to refugees that are lower than the State's TANF payment for the same sized family unit. In States that have TANF payment levels that are higher than the ceilings established in this section, States and local resettlement agencies must provide payment levels under the public/private RCA program that are comparable to the State's TANF payment levels.

      (c) Income disregards and other incentives. (1) States and local resettlement agencies may design an assistance program that combines RCA payments with income disregards or other incentives such as employment bonuses, or graduated payments in order to encourage early employment and self-sufficiency, as long as the total combined payments to a refugee do not exceed the ORR monthly ceilings established in this section multiplied by the allowable number of months of RCA eligibility.

      (2) States that elect to exceed monthly payment ceilings in order to provide employment incentives must budget their resources to ensure that sufficient RCA funds are available to cover a refugee's cash assistance needs in the latter months of a refugee's eligibility period, if needed.

      (d) If the Director determines that the payment ceilings need to be adjusted for inflation, the Director will publish a document in the  announcing the new payment ceilings.

      (b) Allowable services under the public/private program are limited to those services described in §§ 400.154 and 400.155 and are to be funded in accordance with § 400.206.

      (c) In public/private programs in which local resettlement agencies are responsible for administering both cash assistance and services, States and local resettlement agencies must coordinate on a regular basis with refugee mutual assistance associations and other ethnic representatives that represent or serve the ethnic populations that are being resettled in the U.S. to ensure that the services provided under the public/private RCA program:

      (1) Are appropriate to the linguistic and cultural needs of the incoming populations; and

      (2) Are coordinated with the longer-term resettlement services frequently provided by ethnic community organizations after the end of the time-limited RCA eligibility period.

      (d) In public/private programs in which the agencies responsible for providing services to RCA recipients are not the same agencies that administer the cash assistance program, the State must:

      (1) Establish procedures to ensure close coordination between the local resettlement agencies that provide cash assistance and the agencies that provide services to RCA recipients; and

      (2) Set up a system of accountability that identifies the responsibilities of each participating agency and holds these agencies accountable for the results of the program components for which they are responsible.

In developing these procedures, consideration must be given to ensuring coverage of eligible secondary migrants and other eligible applicants who were sponsored by a resettlement agency which does not have a presence in the State or who were not sponsored by any agency.

      § 400.63   Preparation of local resettlement agencies.

#### § § 400.63

      The State and the national voluntary agencies whose affiliate agencies will be responsible for implementing the public/private RCA program:

      (a) Must determine the training needed to enable local resettlement agencies to achieve a smooth implementation of the RCA program; and

      (b) Must provide the training in a uniform way to ensure that all local resettlement agencies in the State will implement the public/private RCA program in a consistent manner.

#### § § 400.66

      (a) In administering a publicly-administered refugee cash assistance program, the State agency must operate its refugee cash assistance program consistent with the provisions of its TANF program in regard to:

      Criteria for Appropriate Employability Services and Employment

        § 400.81   Criteria for appropriate employability services and employment.

#### § § 400.81

        The State agency or its designee must determine if employability services and employment are appropriate in accordance with the following criteria:

        (a) The services or employment must meet the following criteria, or, if approved by the Director, the comparable criteria applied by the State in an alternative program for TANF recipients:

        (1) All assignments must be within the scope of the individual's employability plan. The plan may be modified to reflect changed services or employment conditions.

        (2) The services or employment must be related to the capability of the individual to perform the task on a regular basis. Any claim of adverse effect on physical or mental health must be based on adequate medical testimony from a physician or licensed or certified psychologist indicating that participation would impair the individual's physical or mental health.

        (3) The total daily commuting time to and from home to the service or employment site must not normally exceed 2 hours, not including the transporting of a child to and from a child care facility, unless a longer commuting distance or time is generally accepted in the community, in which case the round trip commuting time must not exceed the generally accepted community standards.

        (4) When child care is required, the care must meet the standards normally required by the State in its work and training programs for TANF recipients.

        (5) The service or work site to which the individual is assigned must not be in violation of applicable Federal, State, or local health and safety standards.

        (6) Assignments must not be made which are discriminatory in terms of age, sex, race, creed, color, or national origin.

        (7) Appropriate work may be temporary, permanent, full-time, part-time, or seasonal work if such work meets the other standards of this section.

        (8) The wage shall meet or exceed the Federal or State minimum wage law, whichever is applicable, or if such laws are not applicable, the wage shall not be substantially less favorable than the wage normally paid for similar work in that labor market.

        (9) The daily hours of work and the weekly hours of work shall not exceed those customary to the occupation. And

        (10) No individual may be required to accept employment if:

        (i) The position offered is vacant due to a strike, lockout, or other bona fide labor dispute; or

        (ii) The individual would be required to work for an employer contrary to the conditions of his existing membership in the union governing that occupation. However, employment not governed by the rules of a union in which he or she has membership may be deemed appropriate.

        (11) In addition to meeting the other criteria of this paragraph, the quality of training must meet local employers' requirements so that the individual will be in a competitive position within the local labor market. The training must also be likely to lead to employment which will meet the appropriate work criteria.

        (b) If an individual is a professional in need of professional refresher training and other recertification services in order to qualify to practice his or her profession in the United States, the training may consist of full-time attendance in a college or professional training program, provided that such training: Is approved as part of the individual's employability plan by the State agency, or its designee; does not exceed one year's duration (including any time enrolled in such program in the United States prior to the refugee's application for assistance); is specifically intended to assist the professional in becoming relicensed in his or her profession; and, if completed, can realistically be expected to result in such relicensing. This training may only be made available to individuals who are employed.

        (c) A job offered, if determined appropriate under the requirements of this subpart, is required to be accepted by the refugee without regard to whether such job would interrupt a program of services planned or _in progress_ unless the refugee is currently participating in a program  of on-the-job training (as described in § 400.154(c)) or vocational training (as described in § 400.154(e)) which meets the requirements of this part and which is being carried out as part of an approved employability plan.

Either the State (or local resettlement agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA) or the recipient may terminate this period sooner when either believes that the dispute cannot be resolved by mediation.

        (2)  Under a publicly-administered RCA program, the State must use the same procedures for mediation/conciliation as those used in its TANF program, if available.

        (b)  The State or local resettlement agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA must provide an applicant for, or recipient of, refugee cash assistance an opportunity for a hearing, using the same procedures and standards set forth in § 400.54, to contest a determination concerning employability, or failure or refusal to carry out job search or to accept an appropriate offer of employability services or employment, resulting in denial or termination of assistance.

        Federal funding is available for a State's expenditures for assistance and services to eligible refugees for which the following time limits are met:

        (a)  as described at § 400.11(a)(1) of this part:

        (1) Except for services for unaccompanied minors, a State must use its CMA grants for costs attributable to the Federal fiscal year (FFY) in which the Department awards the grants.

        § 400.211   Methodology to be used to determine time-eligibility of refugees.

#### § § 400.211

        (a) The time-eligibility period for refugee cash assistance and refugee medical assistance will be determined by the Director each year, based on appropriated funds available for the fiscal year. The Director will make a determination of the eligibility period each year as soon as possible after funds are appropriated for the refugee program, and also at subsequent points during the fiscal year, only if a reduction in the eligibility period is indicated, based on updated information on refugee flows and State reports on receipt of assistance and expenditures. The method to be used to determine the RCA/RMA eligibility period will include the following steps and will be applied to various RCA/RMA time-eligibility periods in order to determine the time-eligibility period which will provide the most number of months without incurring a shortfall in funds for the fiscal year.

        (1) The time-eligibility population for the projected fiscal year will be estimated on the basis of the refugee admissions ceiling established by the President for that fiscal year and the anticipated arrival of other persons eligible for refugee assistance, to the extent that data on these persons are available. The anticipated pattern of refugee flow for the projected fiscal year will be estimated based on the best available historical and current refugee flow information that will most accurately forecast the refugee flow for the projected fiscal year. These arrival figures will then be used to determine the time-eligible population for a given duration of RCA/RMA benefits.

        (2) The average annual number of RCA and RMA recipients will be determined by multiplying the estimated time-eligible population established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the estimated RCA and RMA participation rates. The RMA participation rate will take into account both RCA recipients, who are also eligible for RMA, and RMA-only recipients. Recipient data from quarterly performance reports submitted by States for the most recent 4 quarters for which reports are available will be used to determine the appropriate participation rates for various RCA/RMA time-eligibility periods.

        (3) The average annual per recipient cost for RCA and RMA will be estimated separately, based on estimated per recipient costs for the most recent fiscal year, using available data, and inflated for the projected fiscal year using projected increases in per capita cash assistance costs for RCA and per capita Medicaid costs for RMA.

        (4) The expected average number of RCA recipients will be multiplied by the expected RCA per recipient cost to derive estimated RCA costs. The expected average annual number of RMA recipients will be multiplied by the expected RMA per recipient cost to derive estimated RMA costs.

        (5) State administrative costs for the projected fiscal year for all States in the aggregate will be estimated based on total actual allowable expenditures for State administration for the most recent fiscal year. The variable portion of administrative costs will be adjusted for changes in program participation and inflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items as estimated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The fixed portion of administrative costs will be adjusted by the CPI inflator only.

        (6) The total estimated costs for the projected fiscal year will equal the combined estimated costs for RCA, RMA, and State administration as calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

        (b) If, as the Director determines, the period of eligibility needs to be changed from the eligibility period in effect at the time, the Director will publish a final notice in the  announcing the new period of eligibility for refugee cash assistance and refugee medical assistance and the effective date for implementing the new eligibility period. States will be given as much notice as available funds will allow without resulting in a further reduction in the eligibility period. At a minimum, States will be given 30 days' notice.

      If a State wishes to apply for a waiver of a requirement of this part, the Director may waive such requirement with respect to such State, unless required by statute, if the Director determines that such waiver will advance the purposes of this part and is appropriate and consistent with Federal refugee policy objectives.

      § 400.301   Withdrawal from the refugee program.

#### § § 400.301

      (a) In the event that a State decides to cease participation in the refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice to the Director before withdrawing from the program.

      (b) To participate in the refugee program, a State is expected to operate all components of the refugee program, including refugee cash and medical assistance, social services, preventive health, and an unaccompanied minors program if appropriate. A State is also expected to play a coordinating role in the provision of assistance and services in accordance with § 400.5(b). In the event that a State wishes to retain responsibility for only part of the refugee program, it must obtain prior approval from the Director of ORR. Such approval will be granted if it is in the best interest of the Government.

      (c) When a State withdraws from all or part of the refugee program, the Director may authorize a replacement designee or designees to administer the provision of assistance and services, as appropriate, to refugees in that State. A replacement designee must adhere to the same regulations under this part that apply to a State-administered program, with the exception of the following provisions: 45 CFR 400.5(d), 400.7, 400.51(b)(2)(i), 400.58(c), 400.94(a), 400.94(b), 400.94(c), and subpart L. Replacement designees must also adhere to the Subpart L regulations regarding formula allocation grants for targeted assistance, if the State authorized the replacement designee appointed by the Director to act as its agent in applying for and receiving targeted assistance funds. Certain provisions are excepted because they apply only to States and become moot when a State withdraws from participation in the refugee program and is replaced by another entity. States would continue to be responsible for administering the other excepted provisions because these provisions refer to the administration of other State-run public assistance programs.

      Funding and Service Priorities

        § 400.313   Use of funds.

#### § § 400.313

        A State must use its targeted assistance funds primarily for employability services designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Targeted assistance services may continue to be provided after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Targeted assistance funds may not be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more than a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year.

        § 400.314   Priority in provision of services.

#### § § 400.314

        A State must plan its targeted assistance program and allocate its targeted assistance funds in such a manner that services are provided to refugees in the following order of priority, except in certain individual extreme circumstances:

        (a) Cash assistance recipients, particularly long-term recipients;

        (b) Unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and

        (c) Employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence.

        § 400.315   General eligibility requirements.

#### § § 400.315

        (a) For purposes of determining eligibility of refugees for services under this subpart, the same standards and criteria shall be applied as are applied in the determination of eligibility for refugee social services under §§ 400.150 and 400.152(a).

        (b) A State may not provide services under this subpart, except for referral and interpreter services, to refugees who have been in the United States for more than 60 months, except that refugees who are receiving employability services, as defined in § 400.316, as of September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until the services are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length of residence in the U.S.

        § 400.316   Scope of targeted assistance services.

#### § § 400.316

        A State may provide the same scope of services under this subpart as may be provided to refugees under §§ 400.154 and 400.155, with the exception of § 400.155(h).

        § 400.317   Service requirements.

#### § § 400.317

        In providing targeted assistance services to refugees, a State must adhere to the same requirements as are applied to the provision of refugee social services under § 400.156.

        § 400.318   Eligible grantees.

#### § § 400.318

        Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are responsible for the refugee program under 45 CFR 400.5 in States containing counties which qualify for targeted assistance awards. The use of targeted assistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP).

        § 400.319   Allocation of funds.

#### § § 400.319

        (a) A State with more than one qualifying targeted assistance county may allocate its targeted assistance funds differently from the formula allocations for counties presented in the ORR targeted assistance notice in a fiscal year only on the basis of its population of refugees who arrived in the U.S. during the most recent 5-year period. A State may use welfare data as an additional factor in the allocation of targeted assistance funds if it so chooses; however, a State may not assign a greater weight to welfare data than it has assigned to population data in its allocation formula.

        (b) A State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total award to the State is made available to the qualified county or counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program in the county's stead.

      § 400.310   Basis and scope.

#### § § 400.310

      This subpart sets forth requirements concerning formula allocation grants to States under section 412(c)(2) of the Act for targeted assistance.

      § 400.311   Definitions.

#### § § 400.311

      For purposes of this subpart—

      “Targeted assistance grants” means formula allocation funding to States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources for services to refugees.

      § 400.312   Opportunity to apply for services.

#### § § 400.312

      A State must provide any individual wishing to do so an opportunity to apply for targeted assistance services and determine the eligibility of each applicant.

      (g) Funds provided under this part shall not be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carrier to term.

      (k) A State may use funds to make payments for Phase II outreach activities, including related program administration, from allotments made to it under this part for FY 1989 and succeeding fiscal years. The maximum amount that a State may use for this purpose from a fiscal year's allotment is the greater of 1% of its allotment for that fiscal year or $100,000.

      (l) A State may use funds to make payments for employment discrimination education and outreach activities, including related program administration, from allotments made to it under this part for FY 1989 and succeeding fiscal years.

      § 402.21   Fiscal control.

#### § § 402.21

      (a) Fiscal control and accounting procedures must be sufficient to permit preparation of reports required by the Act, this regulation, and other applicable statutes and regulations.

      (b) States must have accounting procedures in place which allow funds provided under this part to be traced from drawdown to allowable SLIAG-related costs. Allowability of the amount and purpose of expenditures must be established for each recipient of SLIAG funds. States must demonstrate that SLIAG-related costs, as defined in this part, incurred in SLIAG-reimbursable activities, equal or exceed the amount of SLIAG funds expended with respect to costs incurred in those activities. Documentation of the method of accounting and appropriate supporting information must be available for audit purposes and for Federal program reviews. To establish allowability of expenditures, States may use methods prescribed in (c) of this section. Alternatively, the State may use any other reliable method of cost calculation, subject to Federal review.

      (c)(1) For public assistance, States may establish allowability by accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of identifiable eligible legalized aliens who qualify for and receive assistance and/or services from the recipient, or by use of a statistically valid sampling of a recipient's public assistance caseload.

      (2) For public health assistance, States may establish allowability by accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of identifiable eligible legalized aliens, or applicants for lawful temporary resident status under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, who qualify for and receive such assistance and/or services, by use of a statistically valid sampling of clients in the public health system of the State or local government, or by using the ratio of eligible legalized aliens in a service population to all members of the relevant service population.

      (3) For educational services, States must be able to demonstrate that:

      (i) Funds provided under this part were used to provide educational services, as defined in this part, to eligible legalized aliens, as defined in this part; and,

      (ii) Payments to local educational agencies or other providers of educational services, as described in section 204(c)(3)(C) of the Act, did not exceed the amounts described in § 402.11(e) of this part.

      (4) With respect to Phase II outreach, as defined in this part, a State must demonstrate that the costs of activities that provide information directly to specific individuals are attributable only to lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, and applicants for such status whose applications were pending with the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time information is provided. For Phase II outreach activities that do not involve the provision of information directly to specific individuals, States must demonstrate that such activities are targeted predominantly to or intended primarily for lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA or applicants for such status whose applications are pending with the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time information is provided. The State must demonstrate that the amount of any fiscal year's allotment used for this purpose did not exceed the amount described in § 402.11(k) and was consistent with the limitations of § 402.11(i).

      (5) With respect to employment discrimination education and outreach, as defined in this part, the State must demonstrate that funds were expended only for activities described in the State's approved application pursuant to § 402.41(d) and the limitations of § 402.11 (i), (n), and (o) and that the amount of any fiscal year's allotment used for this purpose did not exceed the amount described in § 402.11(1).

      (6)(i) For program administrative costs, as defined in this part, a State may establish allowability by use of the proportion of eligible legalized aliens provided assistance and/or services allowable under this part by a recipient, as defined in this part, relative to all persons provided such assistance and/or services; by use of the proportion of program or service costs actually incurred in providing assistance and/or services allowable under this part by a recipient, relative to all costs of providing the same assistance and/or services allowable under this part by the recipient; or by use of such other basis as will document that administrative costs incurred in providing such assistance and/or services and reimbursed under this part are allowable, allocable to SLIAG, and reasonable.

      (ii) Consistent with section 604 of the Emergency Immigrant Education Act, of the amount paid to a State educational agency for educational services, only 1.5 percent may be used for administrative costs incurred by the State educational agency in carrying out its function under this part.

      The Secretary will award funds in a fiscal year under § 402.31 or § 402.33 to States with approved applications for that fiscal year in accordance with the apportionment of funds from the Office of Management and Budget. The Secretary will award funds under § 402.34 to States whose annual reports submitted pursuant to § 402.51 establish that their allowable SLIAG-related costs exceed the total of their allotments, as determined under §§ 402.31 and 402.33. The grant award constitutes the authority to draw and expend funds for the purposes set forth in the Act and this regulation.

      § 402.31   Determination of allocations.

#### § § 402.31

      (a)  Allocations will be computed according to a formula using the following factors and weights:

      (1) 50 percent based on the State's eligible legalized alien population, with 49 percent based upon the number of eligible legalized aliens in a State relative to the number of such aliens in all States, and 1 percent to States which have higher-than-average ratios of eligible legalized aliens to total population relative to the average for all States, based on the proportional number of such aliens; and

      (2) 50 percent based on the ratio of SLIAG-related costs in a State to the total of all such costs in all States.

      (b)  (1) Each time the Department calculates State allocations, it will use the best data then available to the Secretary on the distribution of eligible legalized aliens by State.

      (2) For all years except fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Department will determine each State's SLIAG-related costs to be included in the computation of its allocation for a fiscal year by adding to the sum of SLIAG-related costs reported for all previous fiscal years by that State, pursuant to § 402.51(e) (1) and (2), the total amount of estimated SLIAG-related costs included in the State's approved application for that fiscal year, pursuant to § 402.41(c) (1) and (2). For fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Department will add to the amount of estimated SLIAG-related costs included in the State's approved applications for fiscal years 1993 and 1994, respectively, the sum of SLIAG-related costs for all previous years ending with FY 1991 (for FY 1993 applications) or FY 1992 (for FY 1994 applications), and the first and second quarters of FY 1992 (for FY 1993 applications) or FY 1993 (for FY 1994 applications), pursuant to § 402.52(e)(4). In the event that a State has not submitted an approved report for a fiscal year, the Department will include no costs for that fiscal year in its calculation.

      § 402.32   Determination of state allotments.

#### § § 402.32

      Except as noted below, a State's allotment is the difference between the amount determined under § 402.31(b) of this regulation and the cumulative amount previously allotted to the State. In the event that the amount determined under § 402.31(b) is less than the cumulative amount previously allotted to a State, that State's allotment will be zero. The allotments of the remaining States would be calculated by multiplying the difference between the amount determined under § 402.31(b) of this regulation and the cumulative amount previously allotted to the State by the ratio of the amount of funds available for grants to States to the sum of the differences between the amounts determined under § 402.31(b) and the amounts previously awarded to those States.

      (b) To determine the allocations, the ratio of each State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to the total of all such costs in all States will be calculated. The ratio for each State with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs will be multiplied by total unexpended funds to determine the allocation for each State. The amount allotted to a State will be the amount of the State's allocation under this section or the amount of the State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, whichever is less.

A State may either (1) adopt as its official State-level estimate the estimate of the State's number of eligible legalized aliens provided by the Department, or (2) provide its own estimate, including detailed information on the method and data used in deriving the estimate. If a State has previously provided this information to the Department, it need not be included in the application unless the information has changed.

      (c) Contain an estimate of likely SLIAG-related costs for the fiscal year for which application is being made for each program or activity in which SLIAG-related costs will be incurred. Programs and activities must be identified by the purposes listed in § 402.10(a). Such estimates for FY 1988 should include, as a discrete subset, costs incurred in FY 1987, pursuant to § 402.12.

      (1)(i) Descriptions of the programs and activities for which SLIAG-related costs will be incurred; and,

      (ii) If a State elects to use its allotment for employment discrimination education and outreach, a description of the State's planned education and outreach activities, including: descriptions of the kinds of government or private agencies or other entities, if any, through which these activities will be conducted; brief descriptions of the targeted audience(s) for these activities; and, preproduction copies or the text of any material intended for distribution to the public to be produced or disseminated with SLIAG funds, if available at the time the application is submitted.

      (2) Descriptions of the methodologies used to determine SLIAG-related cost. This description is to include (i) the methodology used in determining the proportion (or actual number) of eligible legalized aliens who are likely to participate in or benefit from the program or service, and (ii) a description of how a unit or other measure of the cost of providing services or benefits was calculated, or, if the estimate is based on actual cost data, a description of how the data were obtained. For SLIAG administrative costs, Phase II outreach, and employment discrimination education and outreach, the descriptions must instead include the basis for the estimate of SLIAG-related costs, as defined in this part.

      (e) Contain information on the criteria for and administrative methods of disbursing funds received under this part.

      (f) Designate a single point of contact (SPOC) in the State responsible for securing and submitting information required by the Act and this regulation and provide the name, title, mailing address, and telephone number of such official. If the grantee agency is different from the SPOC, also provide the name, title, mailing address, and telephone number of the official in that agency responsible for State administration of funds available under this part.

      (a) The Department will review each State's application to ensure that it contains all of the required assurances and information and otherwise is consistent with the Act and this part.

      (b) The Department will assess the reasonableness of each State's estimates of SLIAG-related costs, as required by § 402.41(c) (1) and (2), based on the following:

      (1) Are the activities for which estimates are included in the application allowable under the Act and this part?

      (2) Are the rates of participation by eligible legalized aliens in the activities for which estimates of SLIAG-related costs are included in the application and other assumptions underlying the cost estimates based on reliable empirical data?

      (3) To what extent are the estimates based on actual costs incurred? Are actual costs based on methodologies described in this part or other methodologies likely to result in valid measures of SLIAG-related costs?

      (4) Do current estimates appear to be consistent with past estimates, known actual costs pursuant to § 402.41(c)(2), and current INS eligible legalized alien population data?

      (5) Are revised estimates a result (all or in part) of changes in program activities?

      (c) The Department will notify the State that (1) its application has been approved or (2) its application has been disapproved, together with the reasons for disapproval.

      (d)(1) The Department will forward to the Office of Special Counsel information provided by a State pursuant to § 402.41(d).

      (2) The Office of the Special Counsel will review information forwarded to it by the Department pursuant to paragraph (d) (1) of this section to determine whether the activities described therein conflict with or unnecessarily duplicate other employment discrimination education and outreach efforts. Certification to the Department by the Office of the Special Counsel that the State's submission meets this criterion is a prerequisite for approval by the Department.

      § 410.1001   Definitions.

#### § § 410.1001

      For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply.

      means the Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human Services.

      means an attorney who represents an unaccompanied child in legal proceedings or matters subject to the consent of the unaccompanied child. In order to be recognized as an unaccompanied child's attorney of record by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), for matters within ORR's authority, the individual must provide proof of representation of the child to ORR. ORR notes that attorneys of record may engage with ORR in the course of this representation in order to obtain custody-related document and to engage in other communications necessary to facilitate the representation.

      is a standard ORR applies in determining the types of decisions and actions it makes in relation to the care of an unaccompanied child. When evaluating what is in a child's best interests, ORR considers, as appropriate, the following non-exhaustive list of factors: the unaccompanied child's expressed interests, in accordance with the unaccompanied child's age and maturity; the unaccompanied child's mental and physical health; the wishes of the unaccompanied child's parents or legal guardians; the intimacy of relationship(s) between the unaccompanied child and the child's family, including the interactions and interrelationship of the unaccompanied child with the child's parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the unaccompanied child's well-being; the unaccompanied child's adjustment to the community; the unaccompanied child's cultural background and primary language; length or lack of time the unaccompanied child has lived in a stable environment; individualized needs, including any needs related to the unaccompanied child's disability; and the unaccompanied child's development and identity.

The records of unaccompanied children are the property of ORR, whether in the possession of ORR or a grantee or contractor, and grantees and contractors may not release these records without prior approval from ORR, except for program administration purposes.

      means the individual that coordinates, in whole or in part, assessments of unaccompanied children, individual service plans, and efforts to release unaccompanied children from ORR custody. _Case manager_s also ensure services for unaccompanied children are documented within the case files for each unaccompanied child.

      means a type of care provider facility that opens temporarily to provide shelter and services for unaccompanied children during an influx or emergency. An EIF is not defined as a standard program, shelter, or secure facility under this part. Because of the emergency nature of EIFs, they may be unlicensed or may be exempted from licensing requirements by State and/or local licensing agencies. EIFs may also be operated on federally-owned or leased property, in which case, the facility may not be subject to State or local licensing standards.

      include, but are not limited to, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive products (including emergency contraception), pregnancy testing and non-directive options counseling, sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, and referrals to appropriate specialists. ORR notes that the term “family planning services” does not include abortions. Instead, abortion is included in the definition of  and is further discussed in § 410.1307.

      means an application and supporting documentation which must be completed by a potential sponsor who wishes to have an unaccompanied child released from ORR to their care. ORR uses the application and supporting documentation, as well as other procedures, to determine the sponsor's ability to provide for the unaccompanied child's physical and mental well-being.

      means a facility that is operated by a program, agency or organization licensed by an appropriate State agency, or that meets the requirements of State licensing that would otherwise be applicable if it is in a State that does not allow state licensing of programs providing care and services to unaccompanied children, and that meets the standards for standard programs set forth in § 410.1302, and that is designed for an unaccompanied child who requires close supervision but does not need placement in a secure facility, including a residential treatment center (RTC). It provides 24-hour supervision, custody, care, and treatment. It maintains stricter security measures than a shelter, such as intensive staff supervision, in order to provide supports, manage problem behavior, and prevent children from running away. A heightened supervision facility may have a secure perimeter but shall not be equipped internally with major restraining construction or procedures typically associated with juvenile detention centers or correctional facilities.

      means the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

      means an in-depth investigation of the potential sponsor's ability to ensure the child's safety and well-being, initiated by ORR as part of the sponsor suitability assessment. A home study includes an investigation of the living conditions in which the unaccompanied child would be placed if released to a particular potential sponsor, the standard of care that the unaccompanied child would receive, and interviews with the potential sponsor and other household members. A home study is conducted for any case where it is required by the TVPRA, this part, and for other cases at ORR's discretion, including for those in which the safety and well-being of the unaccompanied child is in question.

      means, for purposes of HHS operations, a situation in which the net bed capacity of ORR's standard programs that is occupied or held for placement by unaccompanied children meets or exceeds 85 percent for a period of seven consecutive days.

      means an individual who has been lawfully vested with the power, and charged with the duty of caring for, including managing the property, rights, and affairs of, a child or incapacitated adult by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether foreign or domestic.

      means an organization or individual attorney who provides legal services to unaccompanied children, either on a pro bono basis or through ORR funding for unaccompanied children's legal services. _Legal service provider_s provide Know Your Rights presentations and screenings for legal relief to unaccompanied children, and/or direct legal representation to unaccompanied children.

      includes lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex.

      means any device attached or adjacent to the child's body that the child cannot easily remove that restricts freedom of movement or normal access to the child's body. For purposes of the Unaccompanied Children Bureau, mechanical restraints are prohibited across all care provider types except in secure facilities, where they are permitted only as consistent with State licensure requirements.

      means:

      (1) Significant surgical or medical procedures;

      (2) Abortions; and

      (3) Medical services necessary to address threats to the life of or serious jeopardy to the health of an unaccompanied child.

      (NOP) means a written notice provided to unaccompanied children placed in restrictive placements, explaining the reasons for placement in the restrictive placement and kept as part of the child's case file. The care provider facility where the unaccompanied child is placed must provide the NOP to the child within 48 hours after an unaccompanied child's arrival at a restrictive placement, as well as at minimum every 30 days the child remains in a restrictive placement.

      means the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

      means an ORR-funded family or group home placement in a community-based setting. An unaccompanied child may be placed in long-term home care if ORR is unable to identify an appropriate sponsor with whom to place the unaccompanied child during the pendency of their immigration legal proceedings. “Long-term home care” has the same meaning as “long-term foster care,” as that term is used in the definition of  provided at 45 CFR 411.5.

      means an ORR-funded short-term placement in a family or group home. “Transitional home care” has the same meaning as “transitional foster care,” as that term is used in the definition of  provided at 45 CFR 411.5.

      means the application of physical force without the use of any device, for the purpose of restraining the free movement of a child's body. This does not include briefly holding a child without undue force in order to calm or comfort them.

      means delivering the unaccompanied child to the physical custody and care of either a care provider facility or an alternative to such a facility. An unaccompanied child who is placed pursuant to this part is in the legal custody of ORR and may only be transferred or released by ORR. An unaccompanied child remains in the custody of a referring agency until the child is physically transferred to a care provider facility or an alternative to such a facility.

      means a three-member panel consisting of ORR's senior-level career staff with requisite experience in child welfare that is convened for the purposes of reviewing requests for reconsideration of restrictive placements. An ORR staff member who was involved with the decision to step-up an unaccompanied child to a restrictive placement may not serve as a _Placement Review Panel_ member with respect to that unaccompanied child's placement.

      mean follow-up services as that term is used in the TVPRA at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)(B). PRS are ORR-approved services which may, and when required by statute must, be provided to an unaccompanied child and the child's sponsor, subject to available resources as determined by ORR, after the child's release from ORR custody. Assistance may include linking families to educational and community resources, home visits, case management, in-home counseling, and other social welfare services, as needed. When follow-up services are required by statute, the nature and extent of those services would be subject to available resources.

      mean situations that affect the entire care provider facility and/or unaccompanied children and its staff within and require immediate action and include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Death of a staff member, other adult, or a child who is not an unaccompanied child but is in the care provider facility's care under non-ORR funding;

      (1) For an individual with a disability, an interpreter who, via a video remote interpreting service (VRI) or an on-site appearance, is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. Qualified interpreters include, for example, sign language interpreters, oral transliterators, and cued-language transliterators.

      (2) For a limited English proficient individual, an interpreter who via a remote interpreting service or an on-site appearance:

      (i) Has demonstrated proficiency in speaking and understanding both spoken English and at least one other spoken language;

      (ii) Is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially to and from such language(s) and English, using any necessary specialized vocabulary or terms without changes, omissions, or additions and while preserving the tone, sentiment, and emotional level of the original oral statement; and

      means a translator who:

      (1) Has demonstrated proficiency in writing and understanding both written English and at least one other written non-English language;

      (3) Adheres to generally accepted translator ethics principles, including client confidentiality.

      means discharge of an unaccompanied child to an ORR-vetted and approved sponsor. After release, ORR does not have legal custody of the unaccompanied child, and the sponsor becomes responsible for providing for the unaccompanied child's physical and mental well-being.

      (RTC) means a sub-acute, time limited, interdisciplinary, psycho-educational, and therapeutic 24-hour-a-day structured program with community linkages, provided through non-coercive, coordinated, individualized care, specialized services, and interventions. RTCs provide highly customized care and services to individuals following either a community-based placement or more intensive intervention, with the aim of moving individuals toward a stable, less intensive level of care or independence. RTCs are a type of secure facility and are not a standard program under this part.

      means a secure facility, including RTCs, or a heightened supervision facility.

      means it is highly probable or reasonably certain that an unaccompanied child will attempt to abscond from ORR care. Such determinations must be made in view of a totality of the circumstances and should not be based solely on a past attempt to run away.

      means a facility with an ORR contract or cooperative agreement having separate accommodations for minors, in a physically secure structure with staff able to control violent behavior. ORR uses a secure facility as the most restrictive placement option for an unaccompanied child who poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having committed a criminal offense. A secure facility is not defined as a standard program or shelter under this part.

      means a kind of standard program in which all of the programmatic components are administered on-site, consistent with the standards set forth in § 410.1302.

      mean non-emergency situations that may immediately affect the safety and well-being of a child. _Significant incidents_ include, but are not limited to:

      means any program, agency, or organization that is licensed by an appropriate State agency to provide residential, group, or transitional or long-term home care services for dependent children, including a program operating family or group homes, or facilities for unaccompanied children with specific individualized needs; or that meets the requirements of State licensing that would otherwise be applicable if it is in a State that does not allow state licensing of programs providing care and services to unaccompanied children. A standard program must meet the standards set forth in § 410.1302. All homes and facilities operated by a standard program, including facilities for unaccompanied children with specific individualized needs, shall be non-secure as required under State law. However, a facility for unaccompanied children with specific individualized needs may maintain that level of security permitted under State law which is necessary for the protection of an unaccompanied child or others in appropriate circumstances.

      means twelve years of age or younger.

      means the movement of an unaccompanied child from one ORR care provider facility to another ORR care provider facility, such that the receiving care provider facility takes over physical custody of the child. ORR sometimes uses the terms “step-up” and “step-down” to describe transfers of unaccompanied children to or from restrictive placements. For example, if ORR transfers an unaccompanied child from a shelter facility to a heightened supervision facility, that transfer would be a “step-up,” and a transfer from a heightened supervision facility to a shelter facility would be a “step-down.” But a transfer from a shelter to a community-based care facility, or vice versa, would be neither a step-up nor a step-down, because both placement types are not considered restrictive.

      means when a trafficker uses rewards and punishments within cycles of abuse to foster a powerful emotional connection with the victim.

      means a system, standard, process, or practice that realizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery; recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in unaccompanied children, families, staff, and others involved with the system; and responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatization.

      means a child who:

      (1) Has no lawful immigration status in the United States;

      (2) Has not attained 18 years of age; and

      (3) With respect to whom:

      (i) There is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or

      (ii) No parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.

      means the child welfare services program available pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1522(d).

      (a) ORR shall accept referrals of unaccompanied children, from any department or agency of the Federal Government at any time of day, every day of the year.

      (b) Upon notification from any department or agency of the Federal Government that a child in its custody is an unaccompanied child and therefore must be transferred to ORR custody, ORR shall identify a standard program placement for the unaccompanied child, unless one of the listed exceptions in § 410.1104 applies, and notify the referring Federal agency within 24 hours of receiving the referring agency's notification whenever possible, and no later than within 48 hours of receiving notification, barring exceptional circumstances. ORR may seek clarification about the information provided by the referring agency as needed. In such instances, ORR shall notify the referring agency and work with the referring agency, including by requesting additional information, in accordance with statutory time frames.

      (c) ORR shall work with the referring Federal Government department or agency to accept transfer of custody of the unaccompanied child, consistent with the statutory requirements at 8 U.S.C. 1232(b)(3).

      (d) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, ORR may be unable to timely identify a placement for and timely accept transfer of custody of an unaccompanied child due to exceptional circumstances, including:

      (1) Any court decree or court-approved settlement that requires otherwise;

      (2) An influx, as defined at § 410.1001;

      (3) An emergency, including a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane, a facility fire, or a civil disturbance;

      (4) A medical emergency, such as a viral epidemic or pandemic among a group of unaccompanied children;

      (5) The apprehension of an unaccompanied child in a remote location;

      (6) The apprehension of an unaccompanied child whom the referring Federal agency indicates:

      (i) Poses a danger to self or others; or

      (ii) Has been charged with or has been convicted of a crime, or is the subject of delinquency proceedings, delinquency charge, or has been adjudicated delinquent, and additional information is essential in order to determine an appropriate ORR placement.

      (e) ORR shall take legal custody of an unaccompanied child when it assumes physical custody from the referring agency.

      § 410.1102   Care provider facility types.

#### § § 410.1102

      ORR may place unaccompanied children in care provider facilities as defined at § 410.1001, including but not limited to shelters, group homes, individual family homes, heightened supervision facilities, or secure facilities, including RTCs. ORR may place unaccompanied children in out-of-network (OON) placements, subject to § 410.1103, if ORR determines that a child has a specific need that cannot be met within the ORR network of facilities, if no in-network care provider facility equipped to meet the child's needs has the capacity to accept a new placement, or if transfer to a less restrictive facility is warranted and ORR is unable to place the child in a less restrictive in-network facility. Unaccompanied children shall be separated from delinquent offenders in OON placements (except those unaccompanied children who meet the requirements for a secure placement pursuant to § 410.1105). In times of influx or emergency, as further discussed in subpart I of this part, ORR may place unaccompanied children in care provider facilities that may not meet the standards of a standard program, but rather meet the standards in subpart I.

      § 410.1103   Considerations generally applicable to the placement of an unaccompanied child.

#### § § 410.1103

      (a) ORR shall place each unaccompanied child in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child and appropriate to the unaccompanied child's age and individualized needs, provided that such setting is consistent with the interest in ensuring the unaccompanied child's timely appearance before DHS and the immigration courts and in protecting the unaccompanied child's well-being and that of others.

      (b) ORR shall consider the following factors to the extent they are relevant to the unaccompanied child's placement, including:

      (1) Danger to self;

      (2) Danger to the community/others;

      (3) Runaway risk;

      (4) Trafficking in persons or other safety concerns;

      (5) Age;

      (6) Gender;

      (7) LGBTQI+ status or identity;

      (8) Disability;

      (9) Any specialized services or treatment required or requested by the unaccompanied child;

      (10) Criminal background;

      (11) Location of potential sponsor and safe and timely release options;

      (12) Behavior;

      (13) Siblings in ORR custody;

      (14) Language access;

      (15) Whether the unaccompanied child is pregnant or parenting;

      (16) Location of the unaccompanied child's apprehension; and

      (17) Length of stay in ORR custody.

      (c) ORR may utilize information provided by the referring Federal agency, child assessment tools, interviews, and pertinent documentation to determine the placement of all unaccompanied children. ORR may obtain any records from local, State, and Federal agencies regarding an unaccompanied child to inform placement decisions.

      (d) ORR shall review, at least every 30 days, the placement of an unaccompanied child in a restrictive placement to determine whether a new level of care is appropriate.

      (e) ORR shall make reasonable efforts to provide licensed placements in those geographical areas where DHS encounters the majority of unaccompanied children.

      (f) A care provider facility must accept the placement of unaccompanied children as determined by ORR, and may deny placement only for the following reasons:

      (1) Lack of available bed space;

      (2) Placement of the unaccompanied child would conflict with the care provider facility's State or local licensing rules;

      (3) Initial placement involves an unaccompanied child with a significant physical or mental illness for which the referring Federal agency does not provide a medical clearance; or

      (4) In the case of the placement of an unaccompanied child with a disability, the care provider facility concludes it is unable to meet the child's disability-related needs, without fundamentally altering the nature of its program, even by providing reasonable modifications and even with additional support from ORR.

      (g) Care provider facilities must submit a written request to ORR for authorization to deny placement of unaccompanied children, providing the individualized reasons for the denial. Any such request must be approved by ORR before the care provider facility may deny a placement. ORR may follow up with a care provider facility about a placement denial to find a solution to the reason for the denial.

      § 410.1104   Placement of an unaccompanied child in a standard program that is not restrictive.

#### § § 410.1104

      ORR shall place all unaccompanied children in standard programs that are not restrictive placements, except in the following circumstances:

      (a) An unaccompanied child meets the criteria for placement in a restrictive placement set forth in § 410.1105; or

      (b) In the event of an emergency or influx of unaccompanied children into the United States, in which case ORR shall place the unaccompanied child as expeditiously as possible in accordance with subpart I of this part.

      § 410.1105   Criteria for placing an unaccompanied child in a restrictive placement.

#### § § 410.1105

      (a)  (1) ORR may place an unaccompanied child in a secure facility (that is not an RTC) either at initial placement or through a transfer to another care provider facility from the initial placement. This determination must be made based on clear and convincing evidence documented in the unaccompanied child's case file. All determinations to place an unaccompanied child in a secure facility (that is not an RTC) will be reviewed and approved by ORR Federal field staff. A finding that a child poses a danger to self shall not be the sole basis for a child's placement in a secure facility (that is not an RTC).

      (2) ORR shall not place an unaccompanied child in a secure facility (that is not an RTC) if less restrictive alternatives in the best interests of the unaccompanied child are available and appropriate under the circumstances. ORR shall place an unaccompanied child in a heightened supervision facility or other non-secure care provider facility as an alternative, provided that the unaccompanied child does not currently pose a danger to others and does not need placement in an RTC pursuant to the standard set forth at 410.1105(c).

      (3) ORR may place an unaccompanied child in a secure facility (that is not an RTC) only if the unaccompanied child:

      (i) Has been charged with or has been convicted of a crime, or is the subject of delinquency proceedings, delinquency charge, or has been adjudicated delinquent, and where ORR deems that those circumstances demonstrate that the unaccompanied child poses a danger to others, not including:

      (A) An isolated offense that was not within a pattern or practice of criminal activity and did not involve violence against a person or the use or carrying of a weapon; or

      (B) A petty offense, which is not considered grounds for stricter means of detention in any case;

      (ii) While in DHS or ORR's custody, or while in the presence of an immigration officer or ORR official or ORR contracted staff, has committed, or has made credible threats to commit, a violent or malicious act directed at others; or

      (iii) Has engaged, while in a restrictive placement, in conduct that has proven to be unacceptably disruptive of the normal functioning of the care provider facility, and removal is necessary to ensure the welfare of others, as determined by the staff of the care provider facility (e.g., stealing, fighting, intimidation of others, or sexually predatory behavior), and ORR determines the unaccompanied child poses a danger to others based on such conduct.

      (b)  (1) ORR may place an unaccompanied child in a heightened supervision facility either at initial placement or through a transfer to another facility from the initial placement. This determination must be made based on clear and convincing evidence documented in the unaccompanied child's case file.

      (2) In determining whether to place an unaccompanied child in a heightened supervision facility, ORR considers if the unaccompanied child:

      (i) Has been unacceptably disruptive to the normal functioning of a shelter such that transfer is necessary to ensure the welfare of the unaccompanied child or others;

      (ii) Is a runaway risk;

      (iii) Has displayed a pattern of severity of behavior, either prior to entering ORR custody or while in ORR care, that requires an increase in supervision by trained staff;

      (iv) Has a non-violent criminal or delinquent history not warranting placement in a secure facility, such as isolated or petty offenses as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;

      (v) Is assessed as ready for step-down from a secure facility, including an RTC.

      (c)  (1) An unaccompanied child with serious mental health or behavioral health issues may be placed in an RTC only if the unaccompanied child is evaluated and determined to be a danger to self or others by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist consulted by ORR or a care provider facility, which includes a determination by clear and convincing evidence documented in the unaccompanied child's case file, including documentation by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist that placement in an RTC is appropriate.

      (2) ORR may place an unaccompanied child in an out of network (OON) RTC when a licensed clinical psychologist or psychiatrist consulted by ORR or a care provider facility has determined that the unaccompanied child requires a level of care only found in an OON RTC either because the unaccompanied child has identified needs that cannot be met within the ORR network of RTCs or no placements are available within ORR's network of RTCs, or that an OON RTC would best meet the unaccompanied child's identified needs.

      (3) The criteria for placement in or transfer to an RTC also apply to transfers to or placements in OON RTCs. Care provider facilities may request ORR to transfer an unaccompanied child to an RTC in accordance with § 410.1601(d).

      (d) For an unaccompanied child with one or more disabilities, consistent with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794(a), ORR's determination under § 410.1105 whether to place the unaccompanied child in a restrictive placement shall include consideration whether there are any reasonable modifications to the policies, practices, or procedures of an available less restrictive placement or any provision of auxiliary aids and services that would allow the unaccompanied child to be placed in that less restrictive facility. ORR's consideration of reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services to facilitate less restrictive placement shall also apply to transfer decisions under § 410.1601 and will be incorporated into restrictive placement case reviews under § 410.1901. However, ORR is not required to take any action that it can demonstrate would fundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity.

      § 410.1106   Unaccompanied children who need particular services and treatment.

#### § § 410.1106

      ORR shall assess each unaccompanied child in its care to determine whether the unaccompanied child requires particular services and treatment by staff to address their individualized needs while in the care and custody of the UC Program. An unaccompanied child's assessed needs may require particular services, equipment, and treatment by staff for various reasons, including, but not limited to disability, alcohol or substance use, a history of serious neglect or abuse, tender age, pregnancy, or parenting. If ORR determines that an unaccompanied child's individualized needs require particular services and treatment by staff or particular equipment, ORR shall place the unaccompanied child, whenever possible, in a standard program in which the unaccompanied child with individualized needs can interact with children without those individualized needs to the fullest extent possible, but which provides services and treatment or equipment for such individualized needs.

      § 410.1107   Considerations when determining whether an unaccompanied child is a runaway risk for purposes of placement decisions.

#### § § 410.1107

      When determining whether an unaccompanied child is a runaway risk for purposes of placement decisions, ORR shall consider, among other factors, whether:

      (a) The unaccompanied child is currently under a final order of removal.

      (b) The unaccompanied child has previously absconded or attempted to abscond from State or Federal custody.

      (c) The unaccompanied child has displayed behaviors indicative of flight or has expressed intent to run away.

      (d) Evidence that the unaccompanied child is experiencing a strong trauma bond to or is threatened by a trafficker in persons or drugs.

      § 410.1108   Placement and services for children of unaccompanied children.

#### § § 410.1108

      (a)  ORR shall accept referrals for placement of parenting unaccompanied children who arrive with children of their own to the same extent that it receives referrals of other unaccompanied children and shall prioritize placing and keeping the parent and child together in the interest of family unity.

      (b)  (1) ORR shall provide the same care and services to the children of unaccompanied children as it provides to unaccompanied children, as appropriate, regardless of the children's immigration or citizenship status.

      (2) U.S. citizen children of unaccompanied children are eligible for public benefits and services to the same extent as other U.S. citizens. Application(s) for public benefits and services shall be submitted on behalf of the U.S. citizen children of unaccompanied children by care provider facilities. Utilization of those benefits and services shall be exhausted to the greatest extent practicable before ORR-funded services are utilized.

      § 410.1109   Required notice of legal rights.

#### § § 410.1109

      (a) ORR shall promptly provide each unaccompanied child in its custody, in a language and manner the unaccompanied child understands, with:

      (1) A State-by-State list of free legal service providers compiled and annually updated by ORR and that is provided to unaccompanied children as part of a Legal Resource Guide for unaccompanied children;

      (2) The following explanation of the right of potential review: “ORR usually houses persons under the age of 18 in the least restrictive setting that is in an unaccompanied child's best interest, and generally not in restrictive placements (which means secure facilities, heightened supervision facilities, or residential treatment centers). If you believe that you have not been properly placed or that you have been treated improperly, you may call a lawyer to seek assistance and get advice about your rights to challenge this action. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may call one from the list of free legal services given to you with this form;” and

      (3) A presentation regarding their legal rights, as provided under § 410.1309(a)(2).

    Subpart C—Releasing an Unaccompanied Child From ORR Custody

      § 410.1200   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1200

      This subpart covers the policies and procedures used to release, without unnecessary delay, an unaccompanied child from ORR custody to a vetted and approved sponsor.

      § 410.1201   Sponsors to whom ORR releases an unaccompanied child.

#### § § 410.1201

      (a) Subject to an assessment of sponsor suitability, when ORR determines that the detention of the unaccompanied child is not required either to secure the child's timely appearance before DHS or the immigration court, or to ensure the child's safety or that of others, ORR shall release a child from its custody without unnecessary delay, in the following order of preference, to:

      (1) A parent;

      (2) A legal guardian;

      (3) An adult relative;

      (4) An adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian as capable and willing to care for the unaccompanied child's well-being in:

      (i) A declaration signed under penalty of perjury before an immigration or consular officer; or

      (ii) Such other document that establishes to the satisfaction of ORR, in its discretion, the affiant's parental relationship or guardianship;

      (5) A licensed program willing to accept legal custody; or

      (6) An adult individual or entity seeking custody, in the discretion of ORR, when it appears that there is no other likely alternative to long term custody, and family unification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility.

      (b) ORR shall not disqualify potential sponsors based solely on their immigration status and shall not collect information on immigration status of potential sponsors for law enforcement or immigration enforcement related purposes. ORR shall not share any immigration status information relating to potential sponsors with any law enforcement or immigration enforcement related entity at any time.

      (c) In making determinations regarding the release of unaccompanied children to potential sponsors, ORR shall not release unaccompanied children on their own recognizance.

      § 410.1202   Sponsor suitability.

#### § § 410.1202

      (a) Potential sponsors shall complete an application package to be considered as a sponsor for an unaccompanied child. The application package may be obtained from either the care provider facility or ORR directly.

      (b) Prior to releasing an unaccompanied child, ORR shall conduct a suitability assessment to determine whether the potential sponsor is capable of providing for the unaccompanied child's physical and mental well-being. At minimum, such assessment shall consist of review of the potential sponsor's application package, including verification of the potential sponsor's identity, physical environment of the sponsor's home, and relationship to the unaccompanied child, if any, and an independent finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the unaccompanied child. ORR may consult with the issuing agency (e.g., consulate or embassy) of the sponsor's identity documentation to verify the validity of the sponsor identity document presented.

      (c) ORR's suitability assessment shall include taking all needed steps to determine that the potential sponsor is capable of providing for the unaccompanied child's physical and mental well-being. As part of its suitability assessment, ORR may require such components as an investigation of the living conditions in which the unaccompanied child would be placed and the standard of care the unaccompanied child would receive, verification of the employment, income, or other information provided by the potential sponsor as evidence of the ability to support the child, interviews with members of the household, a home visit or home study as discussed at § 410.1204. In all cases, ORR shall require background and criminal records checks, which at minimum includes an investigation of public records sex offender registry conducted through the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender public website for all sponsors and adult residents of the potential sponsor's household, and may include a public records background check or an FBI National Criminal history check based on fingerprints for some potential sponsors and adult residents of the potential sponsor's household. Any such assessment shall also take into consideration the wishes and concerns of the unaccompanied child.

      (d) ORR shall assess the nature and extent of the potential sponsor's previous and current relationship with the unaccompanied child, and the unaccompanied child's family, if applicable. Lack of a pre-existing relationship with the child does not categorically disqualify a potential sponsor, but the lack of such relationship will be a factor in ORR's overall suitability assessment.

      (e) ORR shall consider the potential sponsor's motivation for sponsorship; the unaccompanied child's preferences and perspective regarding release to the potential sponsor; and the unaccompanied child's parent's or legal guardian's preferences and perspective on release to the potential sponsor, as applicable.

      (f) ORR shall evaluate the unaccompanied child's current functioning and strengths in conjunction with any risks or concerns such as:

      (1) Victim of sex or labor trafficking or other crime, or is considered to be at risk for such trafficking due, for example, to observed or expressed current needs, e.g., expressed need to work or earn money;

      (2) History of criminal or juvenile justice system involvement (including evaluation of the nature of the involvement, for example, whether the child was adjudicated and represented by counsel, and the type of offense) or gang involvement;

      (3) History of behavioral issues;

      (4) History of violence;

      (5) Any individualized needs, including those related to disabilities or other medical or behavioral/mental health issues;

      (6) History of substance use; or

      (7) Parenting or pregnant unaccompanied child.

      (g) For individual sponsors, ORR shall consider the potential sponsor's strengths and resources in conjunction with any risks or concerns that could affect their ability to function as a sponsor including:

      (1) Criminal background;

      (2) Substance use or history of abuse or neglect;

      (3) The physical environment of the home; and/or

      (4) Other child welfare concerns.

      (h) ORR shall assess the potential sponsor's:

      (1) Understanding of the unaccompanied child's needs;

      (2) Plan to provide adequate care, supervision, and housing to meet the unaccompanied child's needs;

      (3) Understanding and awareness of responsibilities related to compliance with the unaccompanied child's immigration court proceedings, school attendance, and U.S. child labor laws; and

      (4) Awareness of and ability to access community resources.

      (i) ORR shall develop a release plan that will enable a safe release to a potential sponsor through the provision of post-release services if needed.

      § 410.1203   Release approval process.

#### § § 410.1203

      (a) ORR or the care provider providing care for the unaccompanied child shall make and record the prompt and continuous efforts on its part towards family unification and the release of the unaccompanied child pursuant to the provisions of this section. These efforts include intakes and admissions assessments and the provision of ongoing case management services to identify potential sponsors.

      (b) If a potential sponsor is identified, ORR shall explain to both the unaccompanied child and the potential sponsor the requirements and procedures for release.

      (c) Pursuant to the requirements of § 410.1202, the potential sponsor shall complete an application for release of the unaccompanied child, which includes supporting information and documentation regarding the sponsor's identity; the sponsor's relationship to the child; background information on the potential sponsor and the potential sponsor's household members; the sponsor's ability to provide care for the unaccompanied child; and the sponsor's commitment to fulfill the sponsor's obligations in the Sponsor Care Agreement, which requires the sponsor to:

      (1) Provide for the unaccompanied child's physical and mental well-being;

      (2) Ensure the unaccompanied child's compliance with DHS and immigration courts' requirements;

      (3) Adhere to existing Federal and applicable state child labor and truancy laws;

      (4) Notify DHS, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) at the Department of Justice, and other relevant parties of changes of address;

      (5) Provide notice of initiation of any dependency proceedings or any risk to the unaccompanied child as described in the Sponsor Care Agreement; and

      (6) In the case of sponsors other than parents or legal guardians, notify ORR of a child moving to another location with another individual or change of address. Also, in the event of an emergency (e.g., serious illness or destruction of the home), a sponsor may transfer temporary physical custody of the unaccompanied child to another person who will comply with the Sponsor Care Agreement, but the sponsor must notify ORR as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after the transfer.

      (d) ORR shall conduct a sponsor suitability assessment consistent with the requirements of § 410.1202.

      (e) ORR shall not be required to release an unaccompanied child to any person or agency it has reason to believe may harm or neglect the unaccompanied child or fail to present the unaccompanied child before DHS or the immigration courts when requested to do so.

      (f) During the release approval process, ORR shall educate the sponsor about the needs of the unaccompanied child and develop an appropriate plan to care for the unaccompanied child.

      § 410.1204   Home studies.

#### § § 410.1204

      (a) As part of assessing the suitability of a potential sponsor, ORR may require a home study. A home study includes an investigation of the living conditions in which the unaccompanied child would be placed and takes place prior to the child's physical release, the standard of care the child would receive, and interviews with the potential sponsor and others in the sponsor's household.

      (b) ORR shall require home studies under the following circumstances:

      (1) Under the conditions identified in TVPRA at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)(B), which requires home studies for the following:

      (i) A child who is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons;

      (ii) A child with a disability (as defined in 42 U.S.C. 12102) who requires particularized services or treatment;

      (iii) A child who has been a victim of physical or sexual abuse under circumstances that indicate that the child's health or welfare has been significantly harmed or threatened; or

      (iv) A child whose potential sponsor clearly presents a risk of abuse, maltreatment, exploitation, or trafficking to the child based on all available objective evidence.

      (2) Before releasing any child to a non-relative sponsor who is seeking to sponsor multiple children, or who has previously sponsored or sought to sponsor a child and is seeking to sponsor additional children.

      (3) Before releasing any child who is 12 years old or younger to a non-relative sponsor.

      (c) ORR may, in its discretion, initiate home studies if it determines that a home study is likely to provide additional information which could assist in determining that the potential sponsor is able to care for the health, safety, and well-being of the unaccompanied child.

      (d) The care provider must inform the potential sponsor whenever a home study is conducted, explaining the scope and purpose of the study and answering the potential sponsor's questions about the process.

      (e) An unaccompanied child for whom a home study is conducted shall receive an offer of post-release services as described at § 410.1210.

      § 410.1205   Release decisions; denial of release to a sponsor.

#### § § 410.1205

      (a) A potential sponsorship shall be denied, if as part of the sponsor assessment process described at § 410.1202 or the release process described at § 410.1203, ORR determines that the potential sponsor is not capable of providing for the physical and mental well-being of the unaccompanied child or that the placement would result in danger to the unaccompanied child or the community.

      (b) ORR shall adjudicate the completed sponsor application of a parent or legal guardian; brother, sister, or grandparent; or other close relative who has been the child's primary caregiver within 10 calendar days of receipt of the completed sponsor application, absent an unexpected delay (such as a case that requires completion of a home study). ORR shall adjudicate the completed sponsor application of other close relatives who were not the child's primary caregiver within 14 calendar days of receipt of the completed sponsor application, absent an unexpected delay (such as a case that requires completion of a home study).

      (c) If ORR denies release of an unaccompanied child to a potential sponsor who is a parent or legal guardian or close relative, the ORR Director or their designee who is a neutral and detached decision maker shall promptly notify the potential sponsor of the denial in writing via a Notification of Denial letter. The Notification of Denial letter shall include:

      (1) An explanation of the reason(s) for the denial;

      (2) The evidence and information supporting ORR's denial decision and shall advise the potential sponsor that they have the opportunity to examine the evidence upon request, unless ORR determines that providing the evidence and information, or part thereof, to the potential sponsor would compromise the safety and well-being of the unaccompanied child or is not permitted by law;

      (3) Notice that the proposed sponsor may request an appeal of the denial to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, or a designee who is a neutral and detached decision maker and instructions for doing so;

      (4) Notice that the potential sponsor may submit additional evidence, in writing before a hearing occurs, or orally during a hearing;

      (5) Notice that the potential sponsor may present witnesses and cross-examine ORR's witnesses, if such sponsor and ORR witnesses are willing to voluntarily testify; and

      (6) Notice that the potential sponsor may be represented by counsel in proceedings related to the release denial at no cost to the Federal Government.

      (d) The ORR Director, or a designee who is a neutral and detached decision maker, shall review denials of completed sponsor applications submitted by parents or legal guardians or close relative potential sponsors.

      (e) ORR shall inform the unaccompanied child, the unaccompanied child's child advocate, and the unaccompanied child's counsel (or if the unaccompanied child has no attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative, the local legal service provider) of a denial of release to the unaccompanied child's parent or legal guardian or close relative potential sponsor and inform them that they have the right to inspect the evidence underlying ORR's decision upon request unless ORR determines that disclosure is not permitted by law.

ORR may give additional consideration, consistent with paragraph (c), for cases involving unaccompanied children with mental health or other needs who could particularly benefit from ongoing assistance from a community-based service provider, to prioritize potential cases as needed. ORR shall make an initial determination of the level and extent of PRS, if any, based on the needs of the unaccompanied children and the sponsors and the extent appropriations are available. PRS providers may conduct subsequent assessments based on the needs of the unaccompanied children and the sponsors that result in a modification to the level and extent of PRS assigned to the unaccompanied children.

      (4) ORR shall not delay the release of an unaccompanied child if PRS are not immediately available.

      (b)  PRS include services in the areas listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (12) of this section, which shall be provided in a manner that is sensitive to the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and in a way they effectively understand regardless of spoken language, reading comprehension, or disability to ensure meaningful access for all eligible children, including those with limited English proficiency. The comprehensiveness of PRS shall depend on the extent appropriations are available.

      (1)  PRS providers shall work with sponsors and unaccompanied children to address challenges in parenting and caring for unaccompanied children.

      (3)  If the sponsor is not a parent or legal guardian of the unaccompanied child, then the PRS provider shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child information about the benefits of obtaining legal guardianship of the child. If the sponsor is interested in becoming the unaccompanied child's legal guardian, then the PRS provider may assist the sponsor in identifying the legal resources to do so.

      (4)  PRS providers shall assist sponsors and unaccompanied children in accessing relevant legal service resources including resources for immigration matters and unresolved juvenile justice issues.

      (7)  PRS providers shall assist the sponsor in obtaining medical insurance for the unaccompanied child if available and in locating medical providers that meet the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and the sponsor.

PRS providers shall provide the unaccompanied child and sponsor with information and referrals to services relevant to health-related considerations for the unaccompanied child.

      (8)  PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child with relevant mental health resources and referrals for the child. The resources and referrals shall take into account the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and sponsor. If an unaccompanied child requires specialized mental health assistance, PRS providers shall assist the sponsor in making and keeping mental health appointments and monitoring the unaccompanied child's mental health requirements.

      (9)  PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child with relevant resources and referrals for family counseling and/or individual counseling that meet individual needs of the child and the sponsor.

      (11)  PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child information about gang prevention programs in the sponsor's community.

      (12)  PRS providers may assist the sponsor and unaccompanied child with accessing local resources in other specialized service areas based on the needs and at the request of the unaccompanied child or the sponsor.

      (c)  ORR may prioritize referring unaccompanied children with the following needs for PRS if appropriations are not available for it to offer PRS to all children:

If a PRS provider is unable to start PRS within two (2) days of the unaccompanied child's release, PRS shall, to the greatest extent possible, start no later than 30 days after release.

      (2) For a released unaccompanied child who is referred by ORR to receive PRS but is not required to receive an offer of PRS following a home study, the PRS provider shall to the greatest extent practicable start services within two (2) days of accepting a referral.

      (h)  (1) For a released unaccompanied child who is required to receive an offer of PRS under the TVPRA at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)(B), PRS shall be offered for the unaccompanied child until the unaccompanied child turns 18 or the unaccompanied child is granted voluntary departure, granted immigration status, or the child leaves the United States pursuant to a final order of removal, whichever occurs first.

      (2) For a released unaccompanied child who is not required to receive an offer of PRS under the TVPRA at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)(B), but who receives PRS as authorized under the TVPRA, PRS may be offered for the unaccompanied child until the unaccompanied child turns 18, or the unaccompanied child is granted voluntary departure, granted immigration status, or the child leaves pursuant to a final order of removal, whichever occurs first.

      (3) If an unaccompanied child's sponsor, except for a parent or legal guardian, chooses to disengage from PRS and the child wishes to continue receiving PRS, ORR may continue to make PRS available to the child through coordination between the PRS provider and a qualified ORR staff member.

      (i) —(1)  (i) PRS providers shall maintain comprehensive, accurate, and current case files on unaccompanied children that are kept confidential and secure at all times and shall be accessible to ORR upon request.

ORR long-term home care and transitional home care facilities that provide services through a sub-contract or sub-grant are responsible for conducting annual monitoring or site visits of the sub-recipient, as well as weekly desk monitoring. Upon request, care provider facilities must provide findings of such reviews to the designated ORR point of contact.

      (e)  In addition to the other requirements of this section, for all standard programs that are not State-licensed because the State does not allow State licensing of programs providing care and services to unaccompanied children, and emergency or influx facilities, ORR shall conduct enhanced monitoring, including on-site visits and desk monitoring.

      (f)  Care provider facilities shall develop quality assurance assessment procedures that accurately measure and evaluate service delivery in compliance with the requirements of the regulations in this part, as well as those delineated in 45 CFR part 411.

      (g)  Care provider facilities shall report to ORR any emergency incident, significant incident, or program-level event and in accordance with any applicable Federal, State, and local reporting laws. Such reports are subject to the following rules:

      (1) Care provider facilities shall document incidents with sufficient detail to ensure that any relevant entity can facilitate any required follow-up; document incidents in a way that is trauma-informed and grounded in child welfare best practices; and update the report with any findings or documentation that are made after the fact.

      (2) Care provider facilities shall not fabricate, exaggerate, or minimize incidents; use disparaging or judgmental language about unaccompanied children in incident reports; use incident reporting or the threat of incident reporting as a way to manage the behavior of unaccompanied children or for any other illegitimate reason.

      (3) Care provider facilities shall not use reports of significant incidents as a method of punishment or threat towards any child in ORR care for any reason.

      (4) The existence of a report of a significant incident shall not be used by ORR as a basis for an unaccompanied child's step-up to a restrictive placement or as the sole basis for a refusal to step a child down to a less restrictive placement. Care provider facilities are likewise prohibited from using the existence of a report of a significant incident as a basis for refusing an unaccompanied child's placement in their facilities. Reports of significant incidents may be used as examples or citations of concerning behavior. However, the existence of a report itself is not sufficient for a step-up, a refusal to step-down, or a care provider facility to refuse a placement.

      (h)  This paragraph (h) applies to all care provider facilities responsible for the care and custody of unaccompanied children.

      (1) Care provider facilities and PRS providers shall preserve the confidentiality of unaccompanied child case file records and information, and protect the records and information from unauthorized use or disclosure;

      (2) The records included in an unaccompanied child's case file are ORR's property, regardless of whether they are in ORR's possession or in the possession of a care provider facility or PRS provider. Care providers facilities and PRS providers shall not release those records or information within the records without prior approval from ORR, except for program administration purposes;

      (3) Care provider facilities and PRS providers shall provide unaccompanied child case file records to ORR immediately upon ORR's request; and

      (4) Subject to applicable whistleblower protection laws, employees, former employees, or contractors of a care provider facility or PRS provider shall not disclose case file records or information about unaccompanied children, their sponsors, family, or household members to anyone for any purpose, except for purposes of program administration, without first providing advanced notice to ORR to allow ORR to ensure that disclosure of unaccompanied children's information is compatible with program goals and to ensure the safety and privacy of unaccompanied children.

      (i)  Care provider facilities and PRS providers shall maintain adequate records in the unaccompanied child case file and make regular reports as required by ORR that permit ORR to monitor and enforce the regulations in this part and other requirements and standards as ORR may determine are in the interests of the unaccompanied child.

      § 410.1304   Behavior management and prohibition on seclusion and restraint.

#### § § 410.1304

      (a) Care provider facilities shall develop behavior management strategies that include evidence-based, trauma-informed, and linguistically responsive program rules and behavior management policies that take into consideration the range of ages and maturity in the program and that are culturally sensitive to the needs of each unaccompanied child. Care provider facilities shall not use any practices that involve negative reinforcement or involve consequences or measures that are not constructive and are not logically related to the behavior being regulated. Care provider facilities shall not:

      (1) Use or threaten use of corporal punishment, significant incident reports as punishment, unfavorable consequences related to sponsor unification or legal matters (e.g., immigration, asylum); use forced chores or work that serves no purpose except to demean or humiliate the child; forced physical movement, such as push-ups and running, or uncomfortable physical positions as a form of punishment or humiliation; search an unaccompanied child's personal belongings solely for the purpose of behavior management; apply medical interventions that are not prescribed by a medical provider acting within the usual course of professional practice for a medical diagnosis or that increase risk of harm to the unaccompanied child or others; and

      (2) Use any sanctions employed in relation to an individual unaccompanied child that:

      (i) Adversely affect an unaccompanied child's health, or physical, emotional, or psychological well-being; or

      (ii) Deny unaccompanied children meals, hydration, sufficient sleep, routine personal grooming activities, exercise (including daily outdoor activity), medical care, correspondence or communication privileges, religious observation and services, or legal assistance.

      (3) Use prone physical restraints, chemical restraints, or peer restraints for any reason in any care provider facility setting.

      (b) Involving law enforcement should be a last resort. A call by a facility to law enforcement may trigger an evaluation of staff involved regarding their qualifications and training in trauma-informed, de-escalation techniques.

      (c) Standard programs and residential treatment centers (RTCs) are prohibited from using seclusion. Standard programs and RTCs are also prohibited from using restraints, except as described at paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.

      (d) Standard programs and RTCs may use personal restraint only in emergency safety situations.

      (e) Secure facilities (that are not RTCs):

      (1) May use personal restraints, mechanical restraints and/or seclusion in emergency safety situations, and as consistent with State licensure requirements. All instances of seclusion must be supervised and for the short time-limited purpose of ameliorating the underlying emergency risk that poses a serious and immediate danger to the safety of others.

      (2) May restrain an unaccompanied child for their own immediate safety or that of others during transport.

      (3) May restrain an unaccompanied child while at an immigration court or asylum interview if the child exhibits imminent runaway behavior, makes violent threats, demonstrates violent behavior, or if the secure facility has made an individualized determination that the child poses a serious risk of violence or running away if the child is unrestrained in court or the interview.

      (4) Must provide all mandated services under this subpart to the unaccompanied child to the greatest extent practicable under the circumstances while ensuring the safety of the unaccompanied child, other unaccompanied children at the secure facility, and others.

      (f) Care provider facilities may only use soft restraints (e.g., zip ties and leg or ankle weights) during transport to and from secure facilities, and only when the care provider believes a child poses a serious risk of physical harm to self or others or a serious risk of running away from ORR custody.

      § 410.1305   Staff, training, and case manager requirements.

#### § § 410.1305

      (a) Standard programs, restrictive placements, and post-release service (PRS) providers shall provide training to all staff, contractors, and volunteers, to ensure that they understand their obligations under ORR regulations in this part and policies and are responsive to the challenges faced by staff and unaccompanied children. Standard programs and restrictive placements shall ensure that staff are appropriately trained on its behavior management strategies, including de-escalation techniques, as established pursuant to § 410.1304. All trainings should be tailored to the unique needs, attributes, and gender of the unaccompanied children in care at the individual care provider facility. Standard programs, restrictive placements, and PRS providers must document the completion of all trainings in personnel files. All staff, contractors, and volunteers must have completed required background checks and vetting for their respective roles required by ORR;

      (b) Care provider facilities shall meet the staff to child ratios established by their respective States or other licensing entities; and

      (c) Care provider facilities shall have case managers based on site at the facility.

      § 410.1306   Language access services.

#### § § 410.1306

      (a)  (1) To the greatest extent practicable, care provider facilities shall consistently offer unaccompanied children the option of interpretation and translation services in their native or preferred language, depending on the unaccompanied children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand. If after taking reasonable efforts, care provider facilities are unable to obtain a qualified interpreter or translator for the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, care provider facilities shall consult with qualified ORR staff for guidance on how to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities for the children, including those with limited English proficiency.

      (2) Care provider facilities shall prioritize the ability to provide in-person, qualified interpreters for unaccompanied children who need them, particularly for rare or indigenous languages. After care provider facilities take reasonable efforts to obtain in-person, qualified interpreters, then they may use qualified remote interpreter services.

      (3) Care provider facilities shall translate all documents and materials shared with the unaccompanied children, including those posted in the facilities, in the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a timely manner.

      (b)  ORR shall make placement decisions for the unaccompanied children that are informed in part by language access considerations and other factors as listed in § 410.1103(b). To the extent appropriate and practicable, giving due consideration to an unaccompanied child's individualized needs, ORR shall place unaccompanied children with similar language needs within the same care provider facility.

      (c)  (1) Prior to completing the UC Assessment and starting counseling services, care provider facilities shall provide a written notice of the limits of confidentiality they share while in ORR care and custody, and orally explain the contents of the written notice to the unaccompanied children, in their native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they can effectively understand.

      (2) Care provider facilities shall conduct assessments and initial medical exams with unaccompanied children in their native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand.

      (3) Care provider facilities shall provide a standardized and comprehensive orientation to all unaccompanied children in their native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand regardless of spoken language, reading comprehension level, or disability.

      (4) For all step-ups to and step-downs from restrictive placements, care provider facilities shall explain to the unaccompanied children why they were placed in a restrictive setting and/or if their placement was changed and do so in the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand. All documents shall be translated into the unaccompanied children's and/or sponsor's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference.

      (5) If the unaccompanied children are not literate, or if the documents provided during intakes and/or orientation are not translated into a language that they can read and effectively understand, the care provider facility shall have a qualified interpreter orally translate or sign language translate and explain all the documents in the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and confirm with the unaccompanied children that they fully comprehend all material.

      (6) Care provider facilities shall provide information regarding grievance reporting policies and procedures in the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand. Care provider facilities shall also provide grievance reporting policies and procedures in a manner accessible to unaccompanied children with disabilities.

      (7) Care provider facilities shall educate unaccompanied children on ORR's sexual abuse and sexual harassment policies in the unaccompanied children's native or preferred language, depending on the children's preference, and in a way they effectively understand.

      (8) Care provider facilities shall notify the unaccompanied children that care provider facilities shall accommodate the unaccompanied children's language needs while they remain in ORR care.

      (9) For paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section, care provider facilities shall document that the unaccompanied children acknowledge that they effectively understand what was provided to them in the child's case files.

      (d)  (1) Care provider facilities shall provide educational instruction and relevant materials in a format and language accessible to all unaccompanied children, regardless of the child's native or preferred language, including, but not limited to, providing services from an in-person, qualified interpreter, written translations of materials, and qualified remote interpretation when in-person interpretation options have been exhausted.

      (2) Care provider facilities shall provide unaccompanied children with appropriate recreational reading materials in languages in formats and languages accessible to all unaccompanied children for use during their leisure time.

      (3) Care provider facilities shall translate all ORR-required documents provided to unaccompanied children that are part of educational lessons in formats and languages accessible to all unaccompanied children. If written translations are not available, care provider facilities shall orally translate or sign language translate all documents, prioritizing services from an in-person, qualified interpreter and translation before using qualified remote interpretation and translation services.

      (e)  If an unaccompanied child requests religious and/or cultural information or items, the care provider facility shall provide the requested items in the unaccompanied child's native or preferred language, depending on the child's preference, and as long as the request is reasonable.

      (f)  Care provider facilities shall utilize any necessary qualified interpretation or translation services needed to ensure meaningful access by an unaccompanied child's parent(s), guardian(s), and/or potential sponsor(s). Care provider facilities shall translate all documents and materials shared with the parent(s), guardian, and/or potential sponsors in their native or preferred language, depending on their preference.

      (g)  While providing or arranging healthcare services for unaccompanied children, care provider facilities shall ensure that unaccompanied children are able to communicate with physicians, clinicians, and healthcare staff in their native or preferred language, depending on the unaccompanied children's preference, and in a way the unaccompanied children effectively understand, prioritizing services from an in-person, qualified interpreter before using qualified remote interpretation services.

      (h)  Care provider facilities shall make qualified interpretation and/or translation services available to unaccompanied children, child advocates, and legal service providers upon request while unaccompanied children are being provided with those services. Such services shall be available to unaccompanied children in enclosed, confidential areas.

      (i)  Qualified interpreters and translators shall keep confidential all information they receive about the unaccompanied children's cases and/or services while assisting ORR, its grantees, and its contractors, with the provision of case management or other services. Qualified interpreters and translators shall not disclose case file information to other interested parties or to individuals or entities that are not employed by ORR or its grantees and contractors or that are not providing services under the direction of ORR. Qualified interpreters and translators shall not disclose any communication that is privileged by law or protected as confidential under this part unless authorized to do so by the parties to the communication or pursuant to court order.

      § 410.1307   Healthcare services.

#### § § 410.1307

      (a) ORR shall ensure that all unaccompanied children in ORR custody will be provided with routine medical and dental care; access to medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement, consistent with paragraph (c) of this section; family planning services; and emergency healthcare services.

      (b) Standard programs and restrictive placements shall be responsible for:

      (1) Establishment of a network of licensed healthcare providers established by the care provider facility, including specialists, emergency care services, mental health practitioners, and dental providers that will accept ORR's fee-for-service billing system;

      (2) A complete medical examination (including screening for infectious disease) within 2 business days of admission, excluding weekends and holidays, unless the unaccompanied child was recently examined at another facility and if unaccompanied children are still in ORR custody 60 to 90 days after admission, an initial dental exam, or sooner if directed by State licensing requirements;

      (3) Appropriate immunizations as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule and approved by HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;

      (4) An annual physical examination, including hearing and vision screening, and follow-up care for acute and chronic conditions;

      (5) Administration of prescribed medication and special diets;

      (6) Appropriate mental health interventions when necessary;

      (7) Having policies and procedures for identifying, reporting, and controlling communicable diseases that are consistent with applicable State, local, and Federal laws and regulations.

      (8) Having policies and procedures that enable unaccompanied children, including those with language and literacy barriers, to convey written and oral requests for emergency and non-emergency healthcare services;

      (9) Having policies and procedures based on State or local laws and regulations to ensure the safe, discreet, and confidential provision of prescription and nonprescription medications to unaccompanied children, secure storage of medications, and controlled administration and disposal of all drugs. A licensed healthcare provider must write or orally order all nonprescription medications, and oral orders must be documented in the unaccompanied child's file;

      (10) Medical isolation may be used according to the following requirements:

      (i) An unaccompanied child may be placed in medical isolation and excluded from contact with the general population in order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease due to a potential exposure, protect other unaccompanied children, and care provider facility staff for a medical purpose or as required under State, local, or other licensing rules, as long as the medically required isolation is limited only to the extent necessary to ensure the health and welfare of the unaccompanied child, other unaccompanied children at a care provider facility and care provider facility staff, or the public at large.

      (ii) Standard programs and restrictive placements must provide all mandated services under this subpart to the greatest extent practicable under the circumstances to unaccompanied children in medical isolation. Medically isolated unaccompanied children still must be supervised under State, local, or other licensing ratios, and, if multiple unaccompanied children are in medical isolation, they should be placed in units or housing together (as practicable, given the nature or type of medical issue giving rise to the requirement for isolation in the first instance); and

      (11) Urgent dental care if an unaccompanied child is experiencing an urgent dental issue (acute tooth pain, procedure(s) needed to maintain basic function,  severe and/or acute infection or a severe and/or acute infection is imminent). Care should be provided as soon as possible and not be delayed while awaiting the initial dental exam.

      (c) ORR must not prevent unaccompanied children in ORR care from accessing healthcare services, including medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement and family planning services. ORR must make reasonable efforts to facilitate access to those services if requested by the unaccompanied child. Further, if there is a potential conflict between the standards and requirements set forth in this section and State law, such that following the requirements of State law would diminish the services available to unaccompanied children under this section and ORR policies, ORR will review the circumstances to determine how to ensure that it is able to meet its responsibilities under Federal law. If a State law or license, registration, certification, or other requirement conflicts with an ORR employee's duties within the scope of their ORR employment, the ORR employee is required to abide by their Federal duties, subject to applicable Federal religious freedom and conscience protections, to ensure unaccompanied children have access to all services available under this section and other ORR policies.

      (1) —(i)  Consistent with § 410.1103, when placing an unaccompanied child, ORR shall consider the child's individualized needs and any specialized services or treatment required or reasonably requested. Such services or treatment include but are not limited to access to medical specialists, family planning services, and medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement. When such care is determined to be medically necessary during the referral, intake process, Initial Medical Exam, or at any point while the unaccompanied child is in ORR custody, or the unaccompanied child reasonably requests such medical care while in ORR custody, ORR shall, to the greatest extent possible, identify available and appropriate bed space and place the unaccompanied child at a care provider facility that is able to provide or arrange such care, is in an appropriate location to support the unaccompanied child's healthcare needs, and affords access to an appropriate medical provider who is able to perform any reasonably requested or medically necessary services.

      (ii)  If an appropriate initial placement is not immediately available or if the unaccompanied child's need or request for medical care is identified after the Initial Medical Exam, care providers shall immediately notify ORR and ORR shall, to the greatest extent possible, transfer the unaccompanied child needing medical care to an ORR program that meets the qualifications in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (2)  ORR shall ensure unaccompanied children have access to medical care, including transportation across State lines and associated ancillary services if necessary to access appropriate medical services, including access to medical specialists, family planning services, and medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement. The requirement in this paragraph (c)(2) applies regardless of whether Federal appropriations law prevents ORR from paying for the medical care itself.

      (d) Care provider facilities shall notify ORR within 24 hours of an unaccompanied child's need or request for medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement or the discovery of a pregnancy.

      § 410.1308   Child advocates.

#### § § 410.1308

      (a)  This section sets forth the provisions relating to the appointment and responsibilities of independent child advocates for child trafficking victims and other especially vulnerable unaccompanied children.

      (b)  Child advocates are third parties who make independent recommendations regarding the best interests of an unaccompanied child. Their recommendations are based on information obtained from the unaccompanied child and other sources (including, but not limited to, the unaccompanied child's parents, the family, potential sponsors/sponsors, government agencies, legal service providers, protection and advocacy system representatives in appropriate cases, representatives of the unaccompanied child's care provider, health professionals, and others). Child advocates formally submit their recommendations to ORR and/or the immigration court, where appropriate, in the form of best interest determinations (BIDs).

      (c)  The child advocate's responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Visiting with their unaccompanied child client;

      (2) Explaining the consequences and potential outcomes of decisions that may affect their unaccompanied child client;

      (3) Advocating for their unaccompanied child client's best interest with respect to care, placement, services, release, and within proceedings to which the child is a party;

      (4) Providing best interest determinations, where appropriate and within a reasonable time to ORR, an immigration court, and/or other stakeholders involved in a proceeding or matter in which the unaccompanied child is a party or has an interest; and,

      (5) Regularly communicating case updates with the care provider facility, ORR, and/or other stakeholders in the planning and performance of advocacy efforts, including updates related to services provided to an unaccompanied child after their release from ORR care.

      (d)  ORR may appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are victims of trafficking or especially vulnerable.

      (1) An interested party may refer an unaccompanied child for a child advocate when the unaccompanied child is currently, or was previously in, ORR's care and custody, and when that child has been determined to be a victim of trafficking or especially vulnerable. As used in this paragraph (d)(1),  means individuals or organizations involved in the care, service, or proceeding involving an unaccompanied child, including but not limited to, ORR Federal or contracted staff; an immigration judge; DHS Staff; a legal service provider, attorney of record, or DOJ Accredited Representative; an ORR care provider; healthcare professional; or a child advocate organization.

      (2) ORR shall make an appointment decision within five (5) business days of a referral for a child advocate, except under exceptional circumstances which may delay a decision regarding an appointment. ORR will appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are currently in or were previously in ORR care and custody. ORR does not appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are not in or were not previously in ORR care and custody.

      (3) Child advocate appointments terminate upon the closure of the unaccompanied child's case by the child advocate; when the unaccompanied child turns 18; or when the unaccompanied child obtains lawful immigration status.

      (e)  After a child advocate is appointed for an unaccompanied child, the child advocate shall be provided access to materials to effectively advocate for the best interest of the unaccompanied child. Child advocates shall be provided access to their clients during normal business hours at an ORR care provider facility and shall be provided access to all their client's case file information and may request copies of the case file directly from the unaccompanied child's care provider without going through ORR's standard case file request process.

      (f)  Child advocates shall keep the information in the case file, and information about the unaccompanied child's case, confidential. A child advocate may only disclose information from the case file with informed consent from the child when this is in the child's best interests. With regard to an unaccompanied child in ORR care, ORR shall allow the child advocate of that unaccompanied child to conduct private communications with the unaccompanied child, in a private area that allows for confidentiality for in-person and virtual or telephone meetings.

      (g)  ORR shall presume that child advocates are acting in good faith with respect to their advocacy on behalf of unaccompanied children, and shall not retaliate against a child advocate for actions taken within the scope of their responsibilities. For example, ORR shall not retaliate against child advocates because of any disagreement with a best interest determination in regard to an unaccompanied child, or because of a child advocate's advocacy on behalf of an unaccompanied child.

      § 410.1309   Legal services.

#### § § 410.1309

      (a) —(1)  This paragraph (a) describes ORR's responsibilities in relation to legal services for unaccompanied children, consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(5).

      (2)  An unaccompanied child in ORR's legal custody shall receive:

      (i) An in-person, telephonic, or video presentation concerning the rights and responsibilities of undocumented children in the immigration system, presented in the native or preferred language of the unaccompanied child and in an age-appropriate manner.

      (A) Such presentation shall be provided by an independent legal service provider that has appropriate qualifications and experience, as determined by ORR, to provide such presentation and shall include information notifying the unaccompanied child of their legal rights and responsibilities, including protections under child labor laws, and of services to which they are entitled, including educational services. The presentation must be delivered in the native or preferred language of the unaccompanied child and in an age-appropriate manner.

      (B) Such presentation shall occur within 10 business days of child's admission to ORR, within 10 business days of a child's transfer to a new ORR facility (except ORR long-term home care or ORR transitional home care), and every 6 months for unrepresented children who remain in ORR custody, as practicable. If the unaccompanied child is released before 10 business days, a legal service provider shall follow up as soon as practicable to complete the presentation, in person or remotely.

      (ii) Information regarding the availability of free legal assistance and that they may be represented by counsel at no expense to the Government. When an unaccompanied child requests legal counsel, ORR shall ensure that the child is provided with a list and contact information for pro bono counsel, and reasonable assistance to ensure that the child is able to successfully engage an attorney at no cost to the Government.

      (iii) Notification regarding the child's ability to petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification, to request that a juvenile court determine dependency or placement in accordance with § 410.1209, and notification of the ability to apply for asylum or other forms of relief from removal.

      (iv) Information regarding the unaccompanied child's right to a removal hearing before an immigration judge, the ability to apply for asylum with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the first instance, and the ability to request voluntary departure in lieu of removal.

      (v) A confidential legal consultation with a qualified attorney (or paralegal working under the direction of an attorney, or DOJ Accredited Representative) to determine possible forms of relief from removal in relation to the unaccompanied child's immigration case, as well as other case disposition options such as, but not limited to, voluntary departure. Such consultation shall occur within 10 business days of a child's transfer to a new ORR facility (except ORR long-term home care or ORR transitional home care) or upon request from ORR. ORR shall request an additional legal consultation on behalf of a child, if the child has been identified as:

      (A) A potential victim of a severe form of trafficking;

      (B) Having been abused, abandoned, or neglected; or

      (C) Having been the victim of a crime or domestic violence; or

      (D) Persecuted or in fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or for a political opinion.

      (vi) An unaccompanied child in ORR care shall be able to conduct private communications with their attorney of record, DOJ Accredited Representative, or legal service provider in a private enclosed area that allows for confidentiality for in-person, virtual, or telephonic meetings.

      (vii) Information regarding the child's right to a hearing before an independent HHS hearing officer, to determine, through a written decision, whether the unaccompanied child would present a risk of danger to self or to the community if released, as described at § 410.1903(a) and (b).

      (3)  In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for orienting and informing unaccompanied children of their legal rights and access to services while in ORR care, ORR shall also require this information be posted for unaccompanied children in an age-appropriate format and translated into each child's preferred language, in any ORR contracted or grant-funded facility where unaccompanied children are in ORR care.

      (4)  To the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR's discretion and available appropriations. Examples of direct immigration legal representation include, but are not limited to:

      (i) For unrepresented unaccompanied children who become enrolled in ORR Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) programs, provided they have not yet obtained immigration relief or reached 18 years of age at the time of retention of an attorney;

      (ii) For unaccompanied children in ORR care who are in proceedings before EOIR, including unaccompanied children seeking voluntary departure, and for whom other available assistance does not satisfy the legal needs of the individual child;

      (iii) For unaccompanied children released to a sponsor residing in the defined service area of the same legal service provider who provided the child legal services in ORR care, to promote continuity of legal services; and

      (iv) For other unaccompanied children, to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available.

      (b) —(1)  This paragraph (b) provides for the use of additional funding for legal services, to the extent that ORR determines it to be available, to help ensure that the interests of unaccompanied children are considered in certain matters relating to their care and custody, to the greatest extent practicable.

      (2)  To the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR may fund access to counsel for unaccompanied children, including for purposes of legal representation, in the following enumerated non-immigration related matters, subject to ORR's discretion and in no particular order of priority:

      (i) ORR appellate procedures, including Placement Review Panel (PRP), under § 410.1902, and risk determination hearings, under § 410.1903;

      (ii) For unaccompanied children upon their placement in ORR long-term home care or in a residential treatment center outside a licensed ORR facility, and for whom other legal assistance does not satisfy the legal needs of the individual child;

      (iii) For unaccompanied children with no identified sponsor who are unable to be placed in ORR long-term home care or ORR transitional home care;

      (iv) For purposes of judicial bypass or similar legal processes as necessary to enable an unaccompanied child to access certain lawful medical procedures that require the consent of the parent or legal guardian under State law, and when the unaccompanied child is unable or unwilling to obtain such consent;

      (v) For the purpose of representing an unaccompanied child in state juvenile court proceedings, when the unaccompanied child already possesses SIJ classification; and

      (vi) For the purpose of helping an unaccompanied child to obtain an employment authorization document.

      (c)  (1) In-person meetings are preferred during the course of providing legal counsel to any unaccompanied child under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, though telephonic or teleconference meetings between the unaccompanied child's attorney or DOJ Accredited Representative and the unaccompanied child may substitute as appropriate. Either the unaccompanied child's attorney, DOJ Accredited Representative, or a care provider staff member or care provider shall always accompany the unaccompanied child to any in-person courtroom hearing or proceeding, in connection with any legal representation of an unaccompanied child pursuant to this section.

      (2) Upon receipt by ORR of proof of representation and authorization for release of records signed by the unaccompanied child or other authorized representative, ORR shall share, upon request and within a reasonable timeframe to be established by ORR, the unaccompanied child's complete case file, apart from any legally required redactions, to assist in the legal representation of the unaccompanied child. In addition to sharing the complete case file, upon request by an attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative, ORR shall promptly provide the attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative with the name and telephone number of potential sponsors who have submitted a completed family reunification application to ORR for their client, if the potential sponsors have provided consent to release of their information. Furthermore, and absent a reasonable belief based upon articulable facts that doing so would endanger an unaccompanied child, ORR shall ensure that unaccompanied children are allowed to review, upon request and in the company of their attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative if any, such papers, notes, and other writings they possessed at the time they were apprehended by DHS or another Federal department or agency, that are in ORR or an ORR care provider facility's possession.

      (3) If an unaccompanied child's attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative properly requests their client's case file on an expedited basis, ORR shall, within seven calendar days, unless otherwise provided herein, provide the attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative with key documents from the unaccompanied child's case file, as determined by ORR.

      (4) Expedited basis refers to any of the following situations:

      (i) Unaccompanied child has been reported missing to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children;

      (ii) Unaccompanied child has a court hearing scheduled within 30 calendar days;

      (iii) Unaccompanied child is turning 18 years old in less than 30 calendar days;

      (iv) Unaccompanied child has a risk determination hearing pursuant to § 410.1903 of this part scheduled within 30 calendar days;

      (v) Records are needed for the provision of medical services to the child;

      (vi) Records are needed for the child's enrollment or continued enrollment in school;

      (vii) Records are needed for a Federal, State, or local agency investigation related to the subject of the request; or

      (viii) Any other situation in which ORR determines, in its discretion, that an expedited response is warranted.

      (d)  (1) This paragraph (d) prescribes requirements concerning grants or contracts to legal service providers to ensure that all unaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel to represent them in immigration legal proceedings or matters and to protect them from mistreatment, exploitation and trafficking, to the greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the TVPRA [at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(5)] and 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act [at 8 U.S.C. 1362].

      (2) ORR may make grants, in its discretion and subject to available resources—including formula grants distributed geographically in proportion to the population of released unaccompanied children—or contracts under this section to qualified agencies or organizations, as determined by ORR and in accordance with the eligibility requirements outlined in the authorizing statute, for the purpose of providing immigration legal representation, assistance and related services to unaccompanied children who are in ORR care, or who have been released from ORR care and living in a State or region.

      (3) Subject to the availability of funds, grants or contracts shall be calculated based on the historic proportion of the unaccompanied child population in the State within a lookback period determined by the Director, provided annually by the State.

      (e)  ORR shall presume that legal service providers and other legal representatives are acting in good faith with respect to their advocacy on behalf of unaccompanied children and ORR shall not retaliate against a legal service provider or other legal representative for actions taken within the scope of the legal service provider's or representative's responsibilities. For example, ORR shall not engage in retaliatory actions against legal service providers or any other representative for reporting harm or misconduct on behalf of an unaccompanied child or appearance in an action adverse to ORR.

      (f)  ORR shall create and maintain a resource email box for feedback from legal services providers regarding emerging issues related to immediate performance of legal services at care provider facilities. ORR shall address such emerging issues as needed.

      § 410.1310   Psychotropic medications.

#### § § 410.1310

      (a) Except in the case of a psychiatric emergency, ORR shall ensure that authorized individuals provide informed consent prior to the administration of psychotropic medications to unaccompanied children.

      (1) Three categories of persons can serve as an “authorized consenter” and provide informed consent for the administration of psychotropic medication to unaccompanied children in ORR custody: the child's parent or legal guardian, followed by a close relative sponsor, and then the unaccompanied child themself if the child is of sufficient age and a doctor has obtained informed consent; and

      (2) Consent must be obtained voluntarily, without undue influence or coercion, and ORR will not retaliate against an unaccompanied child or an authorized consenter for refusing to take or consent to any psychotropic medication; and

      (3) Any emergency administration of psychotropic medication must be documented, the child's authorized consenter must be notified as soon as possible, and the care provider and ORR must review the incident to ensure compliance with ORR policies and reasonably avoid future emergency administrations of medication.

      (b) ORR shall ensure meaningful oversight of the administration of psychotropic medication(s) to unaccompanied children including reviewing cases flagged by care providers and conducting additional reviews of the administration of psychotropic medications in high-risk circumstances, including but not limited to cases involving young children, simultaneous administration of multiple psychotropic medications, and high dosages. ORR must engage qualified professionals who are able to oversee prescription practices and provide guidance to care providers, such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

      (c) ORR shall permit unaccompanied children to have the assistance of counsel, at no cost to the Federal Government, with respect to the administration of psychotropic medications.

      § 410.1311   Unaccompanied children with disabilities.

#### § § 410.1311

      (a) ORR shall provide notice to the unaccompanied children in its custody of the protections against discrimination under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act at 45 CFR part 85 assured to children with disabilities in its custody. ORR must also provide notice of the available procedures for seeking reasonable modifications or making a complaint about alleged discrimination against children with disabilities in ORR's custody. This notice must be provided in a manner that is accessible to children with disabilities.

      (b) ORR shall administer the UC Program in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of unaccompanied children with disabilities in accordance with 45 CFR 85.21(d), unless ORR can demonstrate that this would fundamentally alter the nature of its UC Program.

      (c) ORR shall make reasonable modifications to its programs, including the provision of services, equipment, and treatment, so that an unaccompanied child with one or more disabilities can have equal access to the UC Program in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. ORR is not required, however, to take any action that it can demonstrate would fundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity.

      (d) Where applicable, ORR shall document in the child's ORR case file any services, supports, or program modifications being provided to an unaccompanied child with one or more disabilities.

      (e) In addition to the requirements for release of unaccompanied children established elsewhere in this part and through any subregulatory guidance ORR may issue, ORR shall adhere to the following requirements when releasing unaccompanied children with disabilities to a sponsor:

      (1) ORR's assessment under § 410.1202 of a potential sponsor's capability to provide for the physical and mental well-being of the child must necessarily include explicit consideration of the impact of the child's disability or disabilities. Correspondingly, ORR must consider the potential benefits to the child of release to a community-based setting.

      (2) In planning for a child's release and conducting post-release services (PRS), ORR and any entities through which ORR provides PRS shall make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices, and procedures if needed to enable released unaccompanied children with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, such as with a sponsor. ORR is not required, however, to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity. ORR will affirmatively support and assist otherwise viable potential sponsors in accessing and coordinating appropriate post-release community-based services and supports available in the community to support the sponsor's ability to care for a child with one or more disabilities, as provided for under § 410.1210.

      (3) ORR shall not delay the release of a child with one or more disabilities solely because post-release services are not in place before the child's release.

    Subpart E—Transportation of an Unaccompanied Child

      § 410.1400   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1400

      This subpart concerns the safe transportation of each unaccompanied child while in ORR's care.

      § 410.1401   Transportation of an unaccompanied child in ORR's care.

#### § § 410.1401

      (a) ORR care provider facilities shall transport an unaccompanied child in a manner that is appropriate to the child's age and physical and mental needs, including proper use of car seats for young children, and consistent with § 410.1304.

      (b) When ORR plans to release an unaccompanied child from its care to a sponsor under the provisions at subpart C of this part, ORR shall assist without undue delay in making transportation arrangements. In its discretion, ORR may require the care provider facility to transport an unaccompanied child. In these circumstances, ORR may, in its discretion, either reimburse the care provider facility or directly pay for the child and/or sponsor's transportation, as appropriate, to facilitate timely release.

      (c) The care provider facility shall comply with all relevant State and local licensing requirements and state and Federal regulations regarding transportation of children, such as meeting or exceeding the minimum staff/child ratio required by the care provider facility's licensing agency, maintaining and inspecting all vehicles used for transportation, etc.

      (d) If there is a potential conflict between ORR's regulations in this part and State law, ORR shall review the circumstances to determine how to ensure that it is able to meet its statutory responsibilities. If a State law or license, registration, certification, or other requirement conflicts with an ORR employee's duties within the scope of their ORR employment, the ORR employee is required to abide by their Federal duties, subject to applicable Federal religious freedom and conscience protections.

      (e) The care provider facility or contractor shall conduct all necessary background checks for individuals transporting unaccompanied children, in compliance with § 410.1305(a).

      (f) If a care provider facility is transporting an unaccompanied child, it shall assign at least one transport staff of the same gender as the child being transported, to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances.

    Subpart F—Data and Reporting Requirements

      § 410.1500   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1500

      ORR shall maintain statistical and other data on the unaccompanied children for whom it is responsible. ORR shall be responsible for coordinating with other Departments to obtain some of the statistical data and shall obtain additional data from care provider facilities. This subpart describes information that care provider facilities shall report to ORR such that ORR may compile and maintain statistical information and other data on unaccompanied children.

      § 410.1501   Data on unaccompanied children.

#### § § 410.1501

      Care provider facilities are required to report information necessary for ORR to maintain data in accordance with this section. Data shall include:

      (a) Biographical information, such as an unaccompanied child's name, gender, date of birth, country of birth, whether of indigenous origin, country of habitual residence, and, if voluntarily disclosed, self-identified LGBTQI+ status or identity;

      (b) The date on which the unaccompanied child came into Federal custody by reason of the child's immigration status, including the date on which the unaccompanied child came into ORR custody;

      (c) Information relating to the unaccompanied child's placement, removal, or release from each care provider facility in which the unaccompanied child has resided, including the date on which and to whom the child is transferred, removed, or released;

      (d) In any case in which the unaccompanied child is placed in detention or released, an explanation relating to the detention or release;

      (e) The disposition of any actions in which the unaccompanied child is the subject;

      (f) Information gathered from assessments, evaluations, or reports of the child; and,

      (g) Data necessary to evaluate and improve the care and services for unaccompanied children, including:

      (1) Data relating to the administration of psychotropic medications. Such information shall include children's diagnoses, the prescribing physician's information, the name and dosage of the medication prescribed, documentation of informed consent, and any emergency administration of medication. Such data shall be compiled in a manner that enables ORR to track how psychotropic medications are administered across the network and in individual facilities.

      (2) Data relating to the treatment of unaccompanied children with disabilities. Such information shall include whether an unaccompanied child has been identified as having a disability, the unaccompanied child's diagnosis, the unaccompanied child's need for reasonable modifications or other services, and information related to release planning. Such data shall be compiled in a manner that enables ORR ongoing oversight to ensure unaccompanied children with disabilities are receiving appropriate care while in ORR care across the network and in individual facilities.

    Subpart G—Transfers

      § 410.1600   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1600

      This subpart provides guidelines for the transfer of an unaccompanied child.

      § 410.1601   Transfer of an unaccompanied child within the ORR care provider facility network.

#### § § 410.1601

      (a)  The care provider facility shall continuously assess unaccompanied children in their care to review whether the children's placements are appropriate. An unaccompanied child shall be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child, subject to considerations regarding danger to self or the community and runaway risk. Care provider facilities shall follow ORR guidance, including guidance regarding placement considerations, when making transfer recommendations.

      (1) If the care provider facility identifies an alternate placement for the unaccompanied child that would best meet the child's needs, the care provider facility shall make a transfer recommendation to ORR for approval within three business days of identifying the need for a transfer.

      (2) The care provider facility shall ensure the unaccompanied child is medically cleared for transfer within three business days of ORR identifying the need for a transfer, unless otherwise waived by ORR. For an unaccompanied child with acute or chronic medical conditions, or seeking medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement, the appropriate care provider facility staff and ORR shall meet to review the transfer recommendation. If a child is not medically cleared for transfer within three business days, the care provider facility shall notify ORR, and ORR shall review and determine if the child is fit for travel. If ORR determines the child is not fit for travel, ORR shall notify the care provider facility of the denial and specify a timeframe for the care provider facility to re-evaluate the child for transfer.

      (3) Within 48 hours prior to the unaccompanied child's physical transfer, the referring care provider facility shall notify all appropriate interested parties of the transfer, including the child's attorney of record or DOJ Accredited Representative, legal service provider, or child advocate, as applicable. However, such advance notice is not required in unusual and compelling circumstances, such as the following cases in which notices shall be provided within 24 hours following transfer:

      (i) Where the safety of the unaccompanied child or others has been threatened;

      (ii) Where the unaccompanied child has been determined to be a runaway risk consistent with § 410.1107; or

      (iii) Where the interested party has waived such notice.

      (4) The unaccompanied child shall be transferred with the child's possessions and legal papers, including, but not limited to:

      (i) Personal belongings;

      (ii) The transfer request and tracking form;

      (iii) 30-day medication supply, if applicable;

      (iv) All health records; and

      (v) Original documents (including birth certificates).

      (5) If the unaccompanied child's possessions exceed the amount permitted normally by the carrier in use, the care provider shall ship the possessions to a subsequent placement of the unaccompanied child in a timely manner.

      (b)  When an unaccompanied child is placed in a restrictive setting (secure, heightened supervision, or residential treatment center), the care provider facility in which the child is placed and ORR shall review the placement at least every 30 days to determine whether a new level of care is appropriate for the child. If the care provider facility and ORR determine in the review that continued placement in a restrictive setting is appropriate, the care provider facility shall document the basis for its determination and, upon request, provide documentation of the review and rationale for continued placement to the child's attorney of record, legal service provider, and/or child advocate.

      (c)  At times, circumstances may require a care provider facility to transfer more than one unaccompanied child at a time (e.g., emergencies, natural disasters, program closures, and bed capacity constraints). For group transfers, the care provider facility shall follow ORR guidance and the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d)  A care provider facility may request ORR to transfer an unaccompanied child in its care to a residential treatment center (RTC), pursuant to the requirements described at § 410.1105(c). The care provider facility shall review the placement of a child into an RTC every 30 days in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (e)  An unaccompanied child who is placed pursuant to subpart B of this part remains in the legal custody of ORR and may only be transferred or released by ORR. However, in the event of an emergency, a care provider facility may temporarily change the physical placement of an unaccompanied child prior to securing permission from ORR but shall notify ORR of the change of physical placement, as soon as possible, but in all cases within eight hours of transfer.

    Subpart H—Age Determinations

      § 410.1700   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1700

      This subpart sets forth the provisions for determining the age of an individual in ORR custody.

      § 410.1701   Applicability.

#### § § 410.1701

      This subpart applies to individuals in the custody of ORR. To meet the definition of an unaccompanied child and remain in ORR custody, an individual must be under 18 years of age.

      § 410.1702   Conducting age determinations.

#### § § 410.1702

      Procedures for determining the age of an individual must take into account the totality of the circumstances and evidence, including the non-exclusive use of radiographs, to determine the age of the individual. ORR may require an individual in ORR custody to submit to a medical or dental examination, including X-rays, conducted by a medical professional or to submit to other appropriate procedures to verify their age. If ORR subsequently determines that such an individual is an unaccompanied child, the individual will be treated in accordance with ORR's UC Program regulations in this part for all purposes.

      § 410.1703   Information used as evidence to conduct age determinations.

#### § § 410.1703

      (a) ORR considers multiple forms of evidence in making age determinations, and determinations are made based upon a totality of evidence.

      (b) ORR may consider information or documentation to make an age determination, including but not limited to:

      (1) If there is no original birth certificate, certified copy, or photocopy or facsimile copy of a birth certificate acceptable to ORR, consulting with the consulate or embassy of the individual's country of birth to verify the validity of the birth certificate presented.

      (2) Authentic government-issued documents issued to the bearer.

      (3) Other documentation, such as baptismal certificates, school records, and medical records, which indicate an individual's date of birth.

      (4) Sworn affidavits from parents or other relatives as to the individual's age or birth date.

      (5) Statements provided by the individual regarding the individual's age or birth date.

      (6) Statements from parents or legal guardians.

      (7) Statements from other persons apprehended with the individual.

      (8) Medical age assessments, which should not be used as a sole determining factor but only in concert with other factors. If an individual's estimated probability of being 18 years or older is 75 percent or greater according to a medical age assessment, and the totality of the evidence indicates that the individual is 18 years old or older, ORR must determine that the individual is 18 years old or older. The 75 percent probability threshold applies to all medical methods and approaches identified by the medical community as appropriate methods for assessing age. Ambiguous, debatable, or borderline forensic examination results are resolved in favor of finding the individual is a child.

      § 410.1704   Treatment of an individual whom ORR has determined to be an adult.

#### § § 410.1704

      If the procedures in this subpart would result in ORR reasonably concluding that an individual is an adult, despite the individual's claim to be under the age of 18, ORR shall treat such person as an adult for all purposes.

    Subpart I—Emergency and Influx Operations

      § 410.1800   Contingency planning and procedures during an emergency or influx.

#### § § 410.1800

      (a) ORR shall regularly reevaluate the number of standard program placements needed for unaccompanied children to determine whether the number of shelters, heightened supervision facilities, and ORR transitional home care beds should be adjusted to accommodate an increased or decreased number of unaccompanied children eligible for placement in care in ORR care provider facilities.

      (b) In the event of an emergency or influx that prevents the prompt placement of unaccompanied children in standard programs, ORR shall place each unaccompanied child in a standard program as expeditiously as possible.

      (c) ORR activities during an influx or emergency include the following:

      (1) ORR shall implement its contingency plan on emergencies and influxes, which may include opening facilities to house unaccompanied children and prioritization of placement at such facilities of certain unaccompanied children;

      (2) ORR shall continually develop standard programs that are available to accept emergency or influx placements; and

      (3) ORR shall maintain a list of unaccompanied children affected by the emergency or influx including each unaccompanied child's:

      (i) Name;

      (ii) Date and country of birth;

      (iii) Date of placement in ORR's custody; and

      (iv) Place and date of current placement.

      § 410.1801   Minimum standards for emergency or influx facilities.

#### § § 410.1801

      (a) In addition to the “standard program” and “restrictive placements” defined in this part, ORR provides standards in this section for all emergency or influx facilities (EIFs).

      (b) EIFs shall provide the following minimum services for all unaccompanied children in their care:

      (2) Appropriate routine medical and dental care; family planning services, including pregnancy tests; medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement; and emergency healthcare services; a complete medical examination (including screenings for infectious diseases) within 48 hours of admission, excluding weekends and holidays, unless the unaccompanied child was recently examined at another ORR care provider facility; appropriate immunizations as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule and approved by HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; administration of prescribed medication and special diets; and appropriate mental health interventions when necessary.

      (3) An individualized needs assessment, which includes the various initial intake forms, identification of the unaccompanied child's individualized needs including any specific problems which appear to require immediate intervention, an educational assessment and plan, and whether an indigenous language speaker; a statement of religious preference and practice; and an assessment of the unaccompanied child's personal goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

      (4) Educational services appropriate to the unaccompanied child's level of development and communication skills in a structured classroom setting Monday through Friday, which concentrates on the development of basic academic competencies, and on English Language acquisition. The educational program shall include instruction and educational and other reading materials in such languages as needed. Basic academic areas may include such subjects as science, social studies, math, reading, writing, and physical education. The program must provide unaccompanied children with appropriate reading materials in languages other than English for use during leisure time.

      (5) Activities according to a recreation and leisure time plan that include daily outdoor activity—weather permitting—with at least one hour per day of large muscle activity and one hour per day of structured leisure time activities (that must not include time spent watching television). Activities should be increased to a total of three hours on days when school is not in session.

      (6) At least one individual counseling session per week conducted by trained social work staff with the specific objective of reviewing the child's progress, establishing new short-term objectives, and addressing both the developmental and crisis-related needs of each child.

      (7) Group counseling sessions at least twice a week.

      (8) Acculturation and adaptation services that include information regarding the development of social and interpersonal skills that contribute to those abilities necessary to live independently and responsibly.

      (9) Whenever possible, access to religious services of the child's choice.

      (10) Visitation and contact with family members (regardless of their immigration status), which is structured to encourage such visitation. The staff must respect the child's privacy while reasonably preventing the unauthorized release of the unaccompanied child.

      (11) A reasonable right to privacy, which includes the right to wear the child's own clothes when available, retain a private space for the storage of personal belongings, talk privately on the phone and visit privately with guests, as permitted by the house rules and regulations, receive and send uncensored mail unless there is a reasonable belief that the mail contains contraband.

      (12) Legal services information, including the availability of free legal assistance, and that they may be represented by counsel at no expense to the Government, the right to a removal hearing before an immigration judge, the ability to apply for asylum with USCIS in the first instance, and the ability to request voluntary departure in lieu of removal.

      (13) EIFs, whether state-licensed or not, must comply, to the greatest extent possible, with all State child welfare laws and regulations (such as mandatory reporting of abuse), as well as all State and local building, fire, health and safety codes, that ORR determines are applicable to non-State licensed facilities.

      (14) EIFs must deliver services in a manner that is sensitive to the age, culture, native language, and complex needs of each unaccompanied child. EIFs must develop an individual service plan for the care of each child.

      (c) EIFs shall do the following when providing services to unaccompanied children:

      (1) Maintain safe and sanitary conditions that are consistent with ORR's concern for the particular vulnerability of children;

      (8) Provide contact with family members who were apprehended with the unaccompanied child; and

      (9) Provide access to legal services described in § 410.1309(a).

      (10) Provide family unification services designed to identify relatives in the United States as well as in foreign countries and assistance in obtaining legal guardianship when necessary for the release of the unaccompanied child.

      (11) Provide an individualized needs assessment, which includes the collection of essential data relating to the identification and history of the child and the child's family; an assessment of family relationships and interaction with adults, peers and authority figures; and identifying information regarding immediate family members, other relatives, godparents or friends who may be residing in the United States and may be able to assist in connecting the child with family members.

      (12) Provide a comprehensive orientation regarding program intent, services, rules (written and verbal), expectations, information about U.S. child labor laws, and the availability of legal assistance.

      (13) Maintain records of case files and make regular reports to ORR. EIFs must have accountability systems in place, which preserve the confidentiality of client information and protect the records from unauthorized use or disclosure.

      (d) ORR may grant waivers of standards under paragraph (b) of this section, in whole or in part, during the first six months of an EIF activation, to the extent that ORR determines that the specific waivers requested are necessary because it would be operationally infeasible to comply with the specified standards, and are granted for no longer than necessary in light of operational feasibility, and the waivers are granted in accordance with law. Such waiver or waivers must be made publicly available. Even where a waiver is granted, EIFs shall make all efforts to meet requisite standards under § 410.1801(b) as expeditiously as possible.

      § 410.1802   Placement standards for emergency or influx facilities.

#### § § 410.1802

      (a) Unaccompanied children who are placed in an emergency or influx facility (EIF) must meet all of the following criteria to the extent feasible. If ORR becomes aware that a child does not meet any of the following criteria at any time after placement into an EIF, ORR shall transfer the unaccompanied child to the least restrictive setting appropriate for that child's need as expeditiously as possible. ORR shall only place a child in an EIF if the child:

      (1) Is expected to be released to a sponsor within 30 days;

      (2) Is age 13 or older;

      (3) Speaks English or Spanish as their preferred language;

      (4) Does not have a known disability or other mental health or medical issue or dental issue requiring additional evaluation, treatment, or monitoring by a healthcare provider;

    Subpart J—Availability of Review of Certain ORR Decisions

      § 410.1900   Purpose of this subpart.

#### § § 410.1900

      This subpart describes the availability of review of certain ORR decisions regarding the care and placement of unaccompanied children.

      § 410.1901   Restrictive placement case reviews.

#### § § 410.1901

      (a) In all cases involving a restrictive placement, ORR shall have the burden to determine, based on clear and convincing evidence, that sufficient grounds exist for stepping up or continuing to hold an unaccompanied child in a restrictive placement. The evidence supporting a restrictive placement decision shall be recorded in the unaccompanied child's case file.

      (b) ORR shall provide an unaccompanied child with a Notice of Placement (NOP) in the child's native or preferred language no later than 48 hours after step-up to a restrictive placement, as well as every 30 days the unaccompanied child remains in a restrictive placement.

      (1) The NOP shall clearly and thoroughly set forth the reason(s) for placement and a summary of supporting evidence.

      (2) The NOP shall inform the unaccompanied child of their right to contest the restrictive placement before a Placement Review Panel (PRP) upon receipt of the NOP and the procedures by which the unaccompanied child may do so. The NOP shall further inform the unaccompanied child of all other available administrative review processes.

      (3) The NOP shall include an explanation of the unaccompanied child's right to be represented by counsel at no cost to the Federal Government in challenging such restrictive placement.

      (4) A case manager shall explain the NOP to the unaccompanied child, in a language the unaccompanied child understands.

      (c) The care provider facility shall provide a copy of the NOP to the unaccompanied child's attorney of record, legal service provider, child advocate, and to a parent or legal guardian of record, no later than 48 hours after step-up as well as every 30 days the unaccompanied child remains in a restrictive placement.

      (1) Service of the NOP on a parent or legal guardian shall not be required where there are child welfare reasons not to do so, where the parent or legal guardian cannot be reached, or where an unaccompanied child 14 or over states that the unaccompanied child does not wish for the parent or legal guardian to receive the NOP.

      (2) Child welfare rationales include but are not limited to: a finding that the automatic provision of the notice could endanger the unaccompanied child; potential abuse or neglect by the parent or legal guardian; a parent or legal guardian who resides in the United States but refuses to act as the unaccompanied child's sponsor; or a scenario where the parent or legal guardian is non-custodial and the unaccompanied child's prior caregiver (such as a caregiver in home country) requests that the non-custodial parent not be notified of the placement.

      (3) When an NOP is not automatically provided to a parent or legal guardian, ORR shall document, within the unaccompanied child's case file, the child welfare reason for not providing the NOP to the parent or legal guardian.

      (d) ORR shall further ensure the following automatic administrative reviews:

      (1) At minimum, a 30-day administrative review for all restrictive placements;

      (2) A more intensive 90-day review by ORR supervisory staff for unaccompanied children in secure facilities; and

      (3) For unaccompanied children in residential treatment centers, the 30-day review at paragraph (d)(1) of this section must involve a psychiatrist or psychologist to determine whether the unaccompanied child should remain in restrictive residential care.

      § 410.1902   Placement Review Panel.

#### § § 410.1902

      (a) All determinations to place an unaccompanied child in a secure facility that is not a residential treatment center will be reviewed and approved by ORR federal field staff. An unaccompanied child placed in a restrictive placement may request reconsideration of such placement. Upon such request, ORR shall afford the unaccompanied child a hearing before the Placement Review Panel (PRP) at which the unaccompanied child may, with the assistance of counsel at no cost to the Federal Government, present evidence on their own behalf. An unaccompanied child may present witnesses and cross-examine ORR's witnesses, if such child and ORR witnesses are willing to voluntarily testify. An unaccompanied child shall be provided access at the PRP hearing to interpretation services in their native or preferred language, depending on the unaccompanied child's preference, and in a way they effectively understand. An unaccompanied child that does not wish to request a hearing may also have their placement reconsidered by submitting a written request for a reconsideration along with any supporting documents as evidence. Where the unaccompanied child does not have an attorney, ORR shall encourage the care provider facility to seek assistance for the unaccompanied child from a contracted legal service provider or child advocate.

      (b) The PRP shall afford any unaccompanied child in a restrictive placement the opportunity to request a PRP review as soon as the unaccompanied child receives a Notice of Placement (NOP). ORR shall permit the unaccompanied child or the unaccompanied child's counsel to review the evidence in support of step-up or continued restrictive placement, and any countervailing or otherwise unfavorable evidence, within a reasonable time before the PRP review is conducted. ORR shall also share the unaccompanied child's complete case file apart from any legally required redactions with their counsel within a reasonable timeframe to be established by ORR to assist in the legal representation of the unaccompanied child.

      (c) ORR shall convene the PRP within 7 days of an unaccompanied child's request for a hearing. ORR may institute procedures to request clarification or additional evidence if warranted, or to extend the 7-day deadline as necessary under specified circumstances.

      (d) The PRP shall issue a written decision in the child's native or preferred language within 7 days of a hearing and submission of evidence or, if no hearing or review of additional evidence is requested, within 7 days following receipt of an unaccompanied child's written statement. ORR may institute procedures to request clarification or additional evidence if warranted, or to extend the 7-day deadline as necessary under specified circumstances.

      (e) An ORR staff member who was involved with the decision to step-up an unaccompanied child to a restrictive placement shall not serve as a PRP member with respect to that unaccompanied child's placement.

      § 410.1903   Risk determination hearings.

#### § § 410.1903

      (a) All unaccompanied children in restrictive placements based on a finding of dangerousness shall be afforded a hearing before an independent HHS hearing officer, to determine, through a written decision, whether the unaccompanied child would present a risk of danger to self or to the community if released, unless the unaccompanied child indicates in writing that they refuse such a hearing. Unaccompanied children placed in restrictive placements shall receive a written notice of the procedures under this section and may use a form provided to them to decline a hearing under this section. Unaccompanied children in restrictive placements may decline the hearing at any time, including after consultation with counsel.

      (b) All other unaccompanied children in ORR custody may request a hearing under this section to determine, through a written decision, whether the unaccompanied child would present a risk of danger to self or to the community if released. Requests under this section must be made in writing by the unaccompanied child, their attorney of record, or their parent or legal guardian by submitting a form provided by ORR to the care provider facility or by making a separate written request that contains the information requested in ORR's form.

      (c) In hearings conducted under this section, ORR bears the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the unaccompanied child would be a danger to self or to the community if released.

      (d) In hearings under this section, the unaccompanied child may be represented by a person of their choosing. The unaccompanied child may present oral and written evidence to the hearing officer and may appear by video or teleconference. ORR may also present evidence at the hearing, whether in writing, or by appearing in person or by video or teleconference.

      (e) Within a reasonable time prior to the hearing, ORR shall provide to the unaccompanied child and their attorney of record the evidence and information supporting ORR's determination, including the evidentiary record.

      (f) A hearing officer's decision that an unaccompanied child would not be a danger to self or to the community if released is binding upon ORR, unless the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply.

      (g) A hearing officer's decision under this section may be appealed by either the unaccompanied child or ORR to the Assistant Secretary of ACF, or the Assistant Secretary's designee.

      (1) Any such appeal request shall be in writing and must be received by ACF within 30 days of the hearing officer decision.

      (2) The Assistant Secretary, or the Assistant Secretary's designee, shall review the record of the underlying hearing, and will reverse a hearing officer's decision only if there is a clear error of fact, or if the decision includes an error of law.

      (3) If the hearing officer's decision found that the unaccompanied child would not pose a danger to self or to the community if released from ORR custody, and such decision would result in ORR releasing the unaccompanied child from its custody (e.g., because the only factor preventing release was ORR's determination that the unaccompanied child posed a danger to self or to the community), an appeal to the Assistant Secretary shall not effect a stay of the hearing officer's decision, unless the Assistant Secretary issues a decision in writing within five business days of such hearing officer decision that release of the unaccompanied child would result in a danger to self or to the community. Such a stay decision must include a description of behaviors of the unaccompanied child while in ORR custody and/or documented criminal or juvenile behavior records from the unaccompanied child demonstrating that the unaccompanied child would present a danger to self or to the community if released.

      (h) Decisions under this section are final and binding on the Department, and an unaccompanied child who was determined to pose a danger to self or to the community if released may only seek another hearing under this section if the unaccompanied child can demonstrate a material change in circumstances. Similarly, ORR may request the hearing officer to make a new determination under this section only if ORR can show that a material change in circumstances means the unaccompanied child should no longer be released due to presenting a danger to self or to the community.

      (i) This section cannot be used to determine whether an unaccompanied child has a suitable sponsor.

      (j) Determinations made under this section will not compel an unaccompanied child's release; nor will determinations made under this section compel transfer of an unaccompanied child to a different placement. Regardless of the outcome of a risk determination hearing or appeal, an unaccompanied child may not be released unless ORR identifies a safe and appropriate placement pursuant to subpart C of this part; and regardless of the outcome of a risk determination hearing or appeal, an unaccompanied child may only be transferred to another placement by ORR pursuant to requirements set forth at subparts B and G of this part.

  PART 411—STANDARDS TO PREVENT, DETECT, AND RESPOND TO SEXUAL ABUSE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT INVOLVING UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN

### Part 411

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 15607 (d).

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 77789, Dec. 24, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Coverage

      § 411.10   Coverage of ORR care provider facilities.

#### § § 411.10

      (a) This part applies to all ORR care provider facilities except secure care provider facilities and traditional foster care homes. Secure care provider facilities must, instead, follow the Department of Justice's National Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape, 28 CFR part 115. Traditional foster care homes are not subject to this part.

      (b) Emergency care provider facilities are subject to every section in this part except:

      (1) Section 411.22(c);

      (2) Section 411.71(b)(4);

      (3) Section 411.101(b);

      (4) Section 411.102(c), (d), and (e); and

      (5) Subpart L.

      (c) Emergency care provider facilities must implement the standards in this rule, excluding the standards listed above, within fifteen (15) days of opening. The Director, however, may, using unreviewable discretion, waive or modify specific sections for a particular emergency care provider facility for good cause. Good cause would only be found in cases where the temporary nature of the emergency care provider facility makes compliance with the provision impracticable or impossible, and the Director determines that the emergency care provider facility could not, without substantial difficulty, meet the provision in the absence of the waiver or modification.

      (d) For the purposes of this part, the terms related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment refer specifically to the sexual abuse or sexual harassment of a UC that occurs at an ORR care provider facility while in ORR care and custody. Incidents of past sexual abuse or sexual harassment or sexual abuse or sexual harassment that occurs in any other context other than in ORR care and custody are not within the scope of this regulation.

    Subpart B—Prevention Planning

      § 411.11   Zero tolerance toward sexual abuse and sexual harassment; Prevention of Sexual Abuse Coordinator and Compliance Manager.

#### § § 411.11

      (a) ORR must have a written policy mandating zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual abuse and sexual harassment and outlining ORR's approach to preventing, detecting, and responding to such conduct. ORR must ensure that all policies and services related to this rule are implemented in a culturally-sensitive and knowledgeable manner that is tailored for a diverse population.

      (b) ORR must employ or designate an upper-level, ORR-wide Prevention of Sexual Abuse Coordinator (PSA Coordinator) with sufficient time and authority to develop, implement, and oversee ORR efforts to comply with these standards in all of its care provider facilities.

      (c) Care provider facilities must have a written policy mandating zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual abuse and sexual harassment and outlining the care provider facility's approach to preventing, detecting, and responding to such conduct. The care provider facility also must ensure that all policies and services related to this rule are implemented in a culturally-sensitive and knowledgeable manner that is tailored for a diverse population. ORR will review and approve each care provider facility's written policy.

      (d) Care provider facilities must employ or designate a Prevention of Sexual Abuse Compliance Manager (PSA Compliance Manager) with sufficient time and authority to develop, implement, and oversee the care provider facility's efforts to comply with the provisions set forth in this part and serve as a point of contact for ORR's PSA Coordinator.

      § 411.12   Contracting with or having a grant from ORR for the care of UCs.

#### § § 411.12

      (a) When contracting with or providing a grant to a care provider facility, ORR must include in any new contracts, contract renewals, cooperative agreements, or cooperative agreement renewals the entity's obligation to adopt and comply with these standards.

      (b) For organizations that contract, grant, or have a sub-grant with a care provider facility to provide residential services to UCs, the organization must, as part of the contract or cooperative agreement, adopt and comply with the provisions set forth in this part.

      (c) All new contracts, contract renewals, and grants must include provisions for monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the contractor, grantee, or sub-grantee is complying with these provisions.

      § 411.13   UC supervision and monitoring.

#### § § 411.13

      (a) Care provider facilities must develop, document, and make their best effort to comply with a staffing plan that provides for adequate levels of staffing, and, where applicable under State and local licensing standards, video monitoring, to protect UCs from sexual abuse and sexual harassment.

      (b) In determining adequate levels of UC supervision and determining the need for video monitoring, the care provider facility must take into consideration the physical layout of the facility, the composition of the UC population, the prevalence of substantiated and unsubstantiated incidents of sexual abuse and sexual harassment, and any other relevant factors. Video monitoring equipment may not be placed in any bathroom, shower or bathing area, or other area where UCs routinely undress.

      (c) Care provider facilities must conduct frequent unannounced rounds to identify and deter sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such rounds must be implemented during night as well as day shifts. Care provider facilities must prohibit staff from alerting others that rounds are occurring, unless such announcement is related to the legitimate operational functions of the care provider facility.

      § 411.14   Limits to cross-gender viewing and searches.

#### § § 411.14

      (a) Cross-gender pat-down searches of UCs must not be conducted except in exigent circumstances. For a UC that identifies as transgender or intersex, the ORR care provider facility must ask the UC to identify the gender of staff with whom he/she would feel most comfortable conducting the search.

      (b) All pat-down searches must be conducted in the presence of one additional care provider facility staff member unless there are exigent circumstances and must be documented and reported to ORR.

      (c) Strip searches and visual body cavity searches of UCs are prohibited.

      (d) Care provider facilities must permit UCs to shower, perform bodily functions, and change clothing without being viewed by staff, except: In exigent circumstances; when such viewing is incidental to routine room checks; is otherwise appropriate in connection with a medical examination or monitored bowel movement; if a UC is under age 6 and needs assistance with such activities; a UC with special needs is in need of assistance with such activities; or the UC requests and requires assistance. If the UC has special needs and requires assistance with such activities, the care provider facility staff member must be of the same gender as the UC when assisting with such activities.

      (e) Care provider facilities must not search or physically examine a UC for the sole purpose of determining the UC's sex. If the UC's sex is unknown, it may be determined during conversations with the UC, by reviewing medical records, or, if necessary, learning that information as part of a broader medical examination conducted in private by a medical practitioner.

      (f) Care provider facilities must train youth care worker staff in proper procedures for conducting pat-down searches, including cross-gender pat-down searches and searches of transgender and intersex UCs. All pat-down searches must be conducted in a professional and respectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with security needs and existing ORR policy, including consideration of youth care worker staff safety.

      § 411.15   Accommodating UCs with disabilities and UCs who are limited English proficient (LEP).

#### § § 411.15

      (a) Care provider facilities must take appropriate steps to ensure that UCs with disabilities (including, for example, UCs who are deaf or hard of hearing, those who are blind or have low vision, or those who have intellectual, psychiatric, or speech disabilities) have an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from all aspects of the care provider facility's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such steps must include, when necessary to ensure effective communication with UCs who are deaf or hard of hearing, providing access to in-person, telephonic, or video interpretive services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. In addition, the care provider facility must ensure that any written materials related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment are translated and provided in formats or through methods that ensure effective communication with UCs with disabilities, including UCs who have intellectual disabilities, limited reading skills, or who are blind or have low vision.

      (b) Care provider facilities must take appropriate steps to ensure that UCs who are limited English proficient have an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from all aspects of the care provider facility's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and sexual harassment, including steps to provide quality in-person or telephonic interpretive services and quality translation services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation and translation, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.

      (c) In matters relating to allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment, the care provider facility must provide quality in-person or telephonic interpretation services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation by someone other than another UC. Care provider facilities also must ensure that any written materials related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment, including notification, orientation, and instruction not provided by ORR, are translated either verbally or in written form into the preferred languages of UCs.

      § 411.16   Hiring and promotion decisions.

#### § § 411.16

      (a) Care provider facilities are prohibited from hiring or promoting any individual who may have contact with UCs and must not enlist the services of any contractor or volunteer who may have contact with UCs and who engaged in: Sexual abuse in a prison, jail, holding facility, community confinement facility, juvenile facility, other institution (as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1997), or care provider facility; who was convicted of engaging or attempting to engage in sexual activity facilitated by force, overt or implied threats of force, or coercion, or if the victim did not consent or was unable to consent or refuse; or who was civilly or administratively adjudicated to have engaged in such activity.

      (b) Care provider facilities considering hiring or promoting staff must ask all applicants who may have direct contact with UCs about previous misconduct described in paragraph (a) of this section in written applications or interviews for hiring or promotions and in any interviews or written self-evaluations conducted as part of performance evaluations of current employees. Care provider facilities also must impose upon employees a continuing affirmative duty to disclose any such misconduct, whether the conduct occurs on or off duty. Care provider facilities, consistent with law, must make their best efforts to contact all prior institutional employers of an applicant for employment to obtain information on substantiated allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment or any resignation during a pending investigation of alleged sexual abuse or sexual harassment.

      (c) Prior to hiring new staff who may have contact with UCs, the care provider facility must conduct a background investigation to determine whether the candidate for hire is suitable for employment with minors in a residential setting. Upon ORR request, the care provider facility must submit all background investigation documentation for each staff member and the care provider facility's conclusions.

      (d) Care provider facilities also must perform a background investigation before enlisting the services of any contractor or volunteer who may have contact with UCs. Upon ORR request, the care provider facility must submit all background investigation documentation for each contractor or volunteer and the care provider facility's conclusions.

      (e) Care provider facilities must either conduct a criminal background records check at least every five years for current employees, contractors, and volunteers who may have contact with UCs or have in place a system for capturing the information contained in a criminal background records check for current employees.

      (f) Material omissions regarding such misconduct or the provision of materially false information by the applicant or staff will be grounds for termination or withdrawal of an offer of employment, as appropriate.

      (g) Unless prohibited by law, the care provider facility must provide information on substantiated allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment involving a former employee upon receiving a request from another care provider facility or institutional employer for whom such employee has applied to work.

      (h) In the event the care provider facility contracts with an organization to provide residential services and/or other services to UCs, the requirements of this section also apply to the organization and its staff.

      § 411.17   Upgrades to facilities and technologies.

#### § § 411.17

      (a) When designing or acquiring any new facility and in planning any substantial expansion or modification of existing facilities, the care provider facility, as appropriate, must consider the effect of the design, acquisition, expansion, or modification upon their ability to protect UCs from sexual abuse and sexual harassment.

      (b) When installing or updating a video monitoring system, electronic surveillance system, or other monitoring technology in a care provider facility, the care provider facility, as appropriate, must consider how such technology may enhance its ability to protect UCs from sexual abuse and sexual harassment while maintaining UC privacy and dignity.

    Subpart C—Responsive Planning

      § 411.21   Victim advocacy, access to counselors, and forensic medical examinations.

#### § § 411.21

      (a) Care provider facilities must develop procedures to best utilize available community resources and services to provide valuable expertise and support in the areas of crisis intervention and counseling to most appropriately address victims' needs. Each care provider facility must establish procedures to make available outside victim services following incidents of sexual abuse and sexual harassment; the care provider facility must attempt to make available to the victim a victim advocate from a rape crisis center. If a rape crisis center is not available or if the UC prefers, the care provider facility may provide a licensed clinician on staff to provide crisis intervention and trauma services for the UC.

    (a)  This part establishes standards, requirements and procedures for investigations by ORR of allegations of child abuse and neglect of an unaccompanied child in ORR custody alleged to have been committed by care provider facility staff, contractors or sub-grantees of the care provider facility, care provider facility volunteers, or other individuals who have access to children in ORR care through contracts or grants with ORR, subject to § 412.100(c).

    (b)  The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. If any provision is stayed or determined to be invalid by a court of law, the remaining provisions shall continue in effect.

    (c)  This part applies to:

    (1) Care provider facilities housing unaccompanied children in States where the State agency responsible for investigating child abuse and neglect allegations will not investigate such allegations in ORR-funded care provider facilities; and

    (2) Emergency or influx facilities (EIFs).

    (d)  Care provider facilities to whom this part applies must have written policies and procedures that allow unaccompanied children, care provider facility staff, contractors or sub-grantees of the care provider facility, care provider facility volunteers, families of unaccompanied children, legal service providers, child advocates, attorneys of record, and any other persons, to report allegations of child abuse and neglect to ORR directly, to the care provider facility, or to a designated entity or office that is not part of the care provider facility. The care provider facility written policies and procedures must:

    (1) Provide unaccompanied children and other individuals with methods for reporting and inform them of how they can report an allegation of child abuse and neglect to a designated entity or office that is not part of the care provider facility. Such entity or office must be able to receive allegations of child abuse and neglect and must immediately forward such allegations to ORR. The method for reporting must allow unaccompanied children to remain anonymous upon request.

    (2) Ensure all the methods of reporting described at § 412.100(d)(1) are accessible for unaccompanied children with disabilities and with limited English proficiency.

    (3) Ensure that unaccompanied children, staff, or others who report allegations of child abuse and neglect are protected against retaliation.

    (e)  When receiving reports of allegations of child abuse and neglect and conducting investigations, ORR must ensure the health and safety of unaccompanied children while making every effort to reduce further trauma to the alleged victim(s).

    (1) If ORR receives a report of an allegation of child abuse or neglect, it must generate an intake report and determine whether the report includes an allegation that, if found to be true, would meet the definition of child abuse and neglect in this part and is consistent with § 412.100(a) and (c). If so, ORR will assign the intake report for investigation. If not, ORR will administratively close the report.

    (2) If ORR determines that an intake report is appropriate for investigation, ORR shall assign an ORR Child Welfare Investigator to make a prompt and thorough investigation of the report to obtain sufficient information to determine whether the allegation of child abuse or neglect is substantiated, either at Tier I or II, based on a preponderance of the evidence.

    (3) ORR shall provide notification that an allegation of child abuse and neglect will be investigated by ORR to the alleged perpetrator; care provider facility; alleged victim; alleged victim's attorney of record (if the child has an attorney of record); and the alleged victim's parent(s), legal guardian(s), or sponsor(s) (as appropriate), unless ORR has evidence showing the parents, legal guardians, or sponsors should not be notified or the victim is 14 years old or older. If the alleged victim is 14 years old or older and ORR has determined that the alleged victim is able to make an independent decision, the alleged victim can affirmatively consent to disclosure.

    (4) Upon notification that an investigation has been initiated, the care provider facility must take immediate responsive measures, for the protection of child welfare, and notify the alleged perpetrator, as appropriate, and ORR of such measures. These measures may extend throughout the pendency of an investigation, and during the pendency of the appeal and review process, as necessary and applicable.

    (5)  (i) ORR shall coordinate with any local or State law enforcement agencies, or other Federal agencies, as appropriate, during its investigation. ORR may pause or resume an investigation at its discretion, with input from law enforcement partners or other relevant investigatory bodies, as necessary.

    (ii) A multidisciplinary team of ORR staff that includes subject matter experts, shall be established, as necessary, to provide input and an assessment of the reported allegation of child abuse or neglect to assist the ORR Child Welfare Investigator.

    (iii) During the investigation, the ORR Child Welfare Investigator must complete, at a minimum, the following actions:

    (A) Upon receiving an intake report, review the intake report and the care provider facility's records on the alleged victim and alleged perpetrator, conduct background checks on the alleged perpetrator, interview the person who reported the allegation if this person was not interviewed during intake, immediately request preservation of any potential video and documentary evidence, and as needed, establish a plan for thoroughly investigating the allegation;

    (B) Visit the care provider facility, as appropriate, to conduct a walkthrough of the facility and review video and documentary evidence;

    (C) Make reasonable efforts to interview all individuals who have information relevant to the allegation of child abuse or neglect, including, but not limited to, the alleged perpetrator (as appropriate), care provider facility staff, the alleged victim, sponsor(s), and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (as appropriate) of the alleged victim, and any other potential witnesses;

    (D) Ensure that interviews conducted as part of the investigation are accessible for individuals with disabilities and with limited English proficiency and are properly documented either in writing or by audio or video recording;

    (E) Gather all relevant information, including documents and audio or video evidence;

    (F) Review any available evidence of past conduct contained in DCPI's records relating to the same alleged perpetrator, except for allegations that resulted in a finding of unfounded or administrative closure; and

    (G) Assess the ongoing risk of child abuse or neglect to the unaccompanied children at the care provider facility and, as appropriate, request that the care provider facility implement a plan to mitigate the risk and ensure the safety of the children.

    (6) After the investigation is complete, ORR may make any of the following dispositions based on the preponderance of the evidence for each reported allegation:

    (i) Substantiated allegation—Tier I;

    (ii) Substantiated allegation—Tier II;

    (iii) Not substantiated allegation;

    (iv) Unfounded allegation; or

    (v) Administrative closure.

    (7)  The existence of any one of the following circumstances in connection to a substantiated finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, of child abuse or neglect shall result in an automatic finding of Substantiated allegation—Tier I:

    (i) The death or near death of a child as a result of child abuse or neglect;

    (ii) Subjecting or exposing a child to sexual abuse or sexual harassment;

    (iii) The infliction of injury or creation of a condition requiring a child to be hospitalized or to receive significant medical attention;

    (iv) Repeated instances of physical abuse committed by the individual against any unaccompanied child in ORR care;

    (v) Failure to take reasonable action to protect a child from sexual abuse or repeated instances of physical abuse under circumstances where the individual knew or should have known that such abuse was occurring; and

    (vi) Depriving a child of necessary care (food, shelter, healthcare, supervision) which either caused serious harm or created a substantial risk of serious harm.

    (8)  If ORR determines that there are no automatic Tier I substantiating circumstances under § 412.100(e)(7), ORR shall consider the following aggravating and mitigating factors together in determining if child abuse or neglect should be substantiated at Tier I or II. Consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors will be based on the totality of the circumstances and the interest of protecting child welfare:

    (i)  Aggravating factors shall be weighed together with any existing mitigating factors. Aggravating factors include any of the following:

    (A) Violations of ORR behavior management requirements pursuant to § 410.1304;

    (B) The individual's failure to comply with clearly established care provider facility policies, corrective action plans, or agreed-upon conditions;

    (C) The tender age, delayed developmental status or other vulnerability of the child;

    (D) Any significant or lasting physical, psychological, or emotional harm to the child;

    (E) An attempt to inflict any significant or lasting physical, psychological, or emotional harm to the child;

    (F) Evidence suggesting a repetition or pattern of abuse or neglect, including multiple instances in which child abuse or neglect was substantiated at Tier I or Tier II and not substantiated allegations if they demonstrate a pattern of abuse or neglect or harm.

    (ii)  Mitigating factors shall be weighed together with any existing aggravating factors. Mitigating factors include any of the following:

    (A) Remedial actions taken by the individual before the investigation was concluded;

    (B) Extraordinary, situational, or temporary stressors that caused the individual to act in an uncharacteristically abusive or neglectful manner;

    (C) The isolated or aberrational nature of the child abuse or neglect; and

    (D) The limited, minor, or negligible physical, psychological, or emotional impact of the abuse or neglect on the child.

    (f)  Records created and information gathered or obtained during an investigation are for internal purposes only, will not be shared or made public unless otherwise required or authorized by law, and may not be disclosed without prior ORR approval. All records must be maintained in an appropriate recordkeeping system with protections for the privacy and security of the individuals identified in the records.

    (g)  (1) ORR must notify the alleged perpetrator of the disposition in writing within five days of making a disposition. ORR must also notify in writing the alleged victim, their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (as appropriate), or sponsor(s), of the disposition within five days of making a disposition.

    (2) If the disposition is substantiated at Tier I, the notification must state:

    (i) The substantiated perpetrator will be considered a Tier 1 sustained perpetrator and their name and other details related to the relevant abuse or neglect findings will be placed on the ORR Central Registry, unless they seek an appeal of the disposition pursuant to § 412.102, and that once identified in the ORR Central Registry they will be prohibited from working or volunteering in any way on ORR-funded grants or contracts, and may not have access to or contact with any unaccompanied child in ORR custody;

    (ii) The reasons for the Tier I substantiated perpetrator's placement on the ORR Central Registry in terms sufficient to put the perpetrator on notice of the conduct or incident(s) upon which it is based;

    (iii) The Tier I substantiated perpetrator may appeal ORR's disposition pursuant to § 412.102, but that if the Tier I substantiated perpetrator either fails to timely submit a notice of appeal, or upon conclusion of the appeal and subsequent review, if any, the disposition is upheld, the Tier I substantiated perpetrator will be added to the ORR Central Registry as a Tier I sustained perpetrator and the disposition will be reported to Federal, State, and local authorities, as appropriate; and

    (iv) ORR's procedures for making the disposition.

    (3) If the disposition is substantiated at Tier II, the notification must inform the Tier II substantiated perpetrator that they may appeal ORR's disposition pursuant to § 412.102, but that if they either fail to timely submit a notice of appeal, or upon the conclusion of the appeal and subsequent review, if any, the disposition is upheld, the Tier II substantiated perpetrator will be designated as a Tier II sustained perpetrator and ORR's disposition will be retained in ORR records. ORR may use these records to determine patterns of child abuse and neglect and to inform future safety planning at care provider facilities. A Tier II sustained perpetrator will not be placed on the ORR Central Registry.

    § 412.101   Interventions and discipline.

#### § § 412.101

    (a)  (1) ORR will maintain an ORR Central Registry consisting of the names of Tier I sustained perpetrators for purposes consistent with § 412.100(a) and (c). The ORR Central Registry will contain names and other identifying information for such persons, and details regarding any sustained allegations of child abuse and neglect against those persons.

    (2) Subject to legal requirements regarding disclosure of information, as well as information sharing obligations with relevant State, local, or Federal authorities, the ORR Central Registry will not be public-facing, nor available to persons outside of ORR. The ORR Central Registry will only be used by ORR to identify Tier I sustained perpetrators, as defined in this part, and for ORR to use as part of the screening process by care provider facilities as described in § 412.101(b).

    (b)  (1) The individuals listed in the ORR Central Registry shall be prohibited from working or volunteering in any way on ORR-funded grants or contracts and may not have access to or contact with any unaccompanied child in ORR custody unless ORR removes such individual from the ORR Central Registry.

    (2) As part of the screening process for hiring decisions for staff, contractors or sub-grantees, or for screening volunteers, all care provider facilities, home study providers, and post-release service providers, whether or not located in States that investigate child abuse and neglect allegations at ORR care provider facilities, must check with ORR to confirm that an applicant is not listed in the ORR Central Registry.

    (3) All care provider facilities, home study providers, and post-release service providers, whether or not located in States that investigate child abuse and neglect allegations at ORR care provider facilities, must also check all of their personnel against the ORR Central Registry at least once annually.

    (c)  Care provider facilities must implement appropriate disciplinary or remedial measures where they or ORR find that care provider facility staff, contractors or sub-grantees of the care provider facility, or care provider facility volunteers engaged in conduct that does not rise to the level of a Tier I substantiated allegation, as defined at § 412.001, but nevertheless raises child welfare concerns.

    (d)  (1) ORR shall refer the names and other identifying information of Tier I sustained perpetrators to relevant State and local authorities and to relevant law enforcement agencies in the State in which the sustained allegation of child abuse or neglect occurred. Additionally, if a State or local authority or relevant local law enforcement agency outside of the State in which the Tier I sustained allegation occurred requests information about the sustained perpetrator, ORR will confirm whether a particular individual is on the ORR Central Registry.

    (2) ORR will provide the names and other identifying information of Tier I sustained perpetrators to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), consistent with any applicable agreements.

    (3) ORR and care provider facilities shall not interfere with another State, local, or Federal authority or agency's investigation into allegations of child abuse and neglect.

    § 412.102   Appeal and review process.

#### § § 412.102

    (a) A substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II may appeal the disposition made by ORR to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) pursuant to § 412.102(c).

    (b)  (1) After ORR substantiates an allegation of child abuse and neglect at Tier I or Tier II, it will send a written notice to the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II, in accordance with § 412.100(g), with notification that the allegation has been substantiated and that, unless they appeal the disposition by ORR, a Tier I substantiated perpetrator will be placed on the ORR Central Registry as a Tier I sustained perpetrator and a Tier II substantiated perpetrator's information will be retained as a Tier II sustained perpetrator in agency records.

    (2) The written notice shall:

    (i) Clearly describe the basis for ORR's disposition that substantiates the relevant allegations at Tier I or Tier II and shall explain the Tier I or Tier II substantiated perpetrator's right to appeal the disposition and the steps required to initiate the appeal.

    (ii) Inform the substantiated perpetrator that they may appeal the ORR disposition before an ALJ.

    (iii) Provide the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II and their attorney, if any, with written information and instructions describing the appeal process.

    (iv) Inform the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II that if they do not submit a notice of appeal within 30 days of receiving the notice of disposition, the DAB will consider the substantiated perpetrator to have waived their opportunity to appeal and any subsequent review. If the appeal is determined to be waived, a Tier I substantiated perpetrator will be identified as a Tier I sustained perpetrator on the ORR Central Registry and a Tier II substantiated perpetrator's information will be retained as a Tier II sustained perpetrator in agency records.

    (c) —(1)  (i) If the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II elects to appeal ORR's disposition that an allegation is substantiated at Tier I or Tier II, they must file a written notice of appeal with the DAB within 30 days of receipt of the written notice of ORR's disposition.

    (ii) Within 30 days of receipt of the notice of appeal, ORR shall provide all evidence it used in making its disposition to the DAB.

    (iii) ORR shall provide the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II and their attorney, if any, all information used in making its disposition except any portion that ORR determines:

    (A) Would compromise the safety and well-being of a child, the reporter, or any other person;

    (B) Would reveal the identity of a child who furnished information with the understanding that their identity would be held in confidence;

    (C) Would reveal the identity of any alleged perpetrator(s) involved in the same case who has an unfounded disposition; or,

    (D) Is otherwise prohibited by State or Federal law or regulation. In the case of information being withheld, the substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II shall be advised of the general nature of the information and the reasons that it is being withheld.

    (2)  (i) The ALJ shall dismiss an appeal when the substantiated perpetrator waives appeal by not submitting a notice of appeal within 30 days of receiving written notice of ORR's disposition, pursuant to § 410.102(b)(2)(iv), and does not demonstrate good cause for the untimely submission; or when the substantiated perpetrator withdraws the appeal, abandons the appeal, or does not have a right to ALJ review. If the appeal of a Tier I substantiated perpetrator is dismissed, they will be placed on the ORR Central Registry as a Tier I sustained perpetrator. If the appeal of a Tier II substantiated perpetrator is dismissed, ORR will retain the information regarding the Tier II substantiated perpetrator as a Tier II sustained perpetrator in agency records.

    (ii) Notwithstanding such dismissal, the DAB may in its discretion temporarily remove the designation of sustained perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II, which would result in ORR removing the individual who was designated as a sustained perpetrator at Tier I from the ORR Central Registry, for situations including, for example, where the ALJ determines that the sustained perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II has established good cause for exceeding the appeal timeframe.

    (d)  (1) When a substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II appeals ORR's disposition to an ALJ pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, ORR must transmit to the ALJ all of the evidence upon which the disposition was based.

    (2) The evidentiary record must contain all documents and other materials, such as video or audio recordings, that were used by ORR in making its disposition. The ALJ may remand the case to ORR if the ALJ determines that the evidentiary record is insufficiently complete to decide whether ORR's disposition is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

    (3) The substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II may be represented by an attorney and may present the testimony of witnesses, documents, factual data, arguments, or other submissions of proof.

    (4) The substantiated perpetrator shall have the burden to show that, considering the totality of the evidence, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to support the substantiated allegation at Tier I or Tier II, and to dispute whether any automatic Tier I substantiating circumstances existed (if applicable) or whether any aggravating factors or mitigating factors existed (if applicable). Both ORR and the substantiated perpetrator may present the testimony of witnesses, documents, factual data, arguments, or other submissions of proof. The testimony of care provider facility staff shall be voluntary and failure to offer such testimony will not be subject to disciplinary action.

    (5) If the substantiated perpetrator submits a notice of appeal and the appeal is not dismissed by the ALJ pursuant to § 412.102(d)(7), ORR must notify the alleged victim and the alleged victim's parent(s), legal guardian(s) (as appropriate), or sponsor(s) that that an appeal of ORR's disposition will be conducted by an ALJ. The alleged victim, other child witness(es), and family members of the alleged victim shall not be required to testify. Refusal to testify shall have no bearing on the determination as to whether abuse did or did not take place.

    (6) The parties may direct and cross examine witnesses either during a live hearing or pursuant to a record review. The parties will be given an opportunity to file briefs or other written statements as to fact or law.

    (7) The ALJ shall conduct a fair and impartial hearing and de novo review to determine whether the substantiated perpetrator met their burden of establishing that, considering the totality of the evidence, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to support the substantiated allegation. The ALJ may either dismiss the case for untimeliness, withdrawal of the appeal, abandonment of the appeal, or because the individual does not have the right to appeal or because of other procedural defects, or will issue a written decision to uphold, modify, or reverse ORR's disposition.

    (8) The ALJ shall serve a copy of the decision upon the parties and the Assistant Secretary for ACF. The ALJ's decision shall provide the sustained perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II and their attorney, if any, with instructions for requesting review by the Assistant Secretary for ACF. The ALJ also shall provide a copy of the decision to the alleged victim and the alleged victim's parent(s), legal guardian(s) (as appropriate), or sponsor(s). The complete record upon which the decision is based shall be made available to the Assistant Secretary.

    (e)  (1) A substantiated perpetrator at Tier I or Tier II may request a review of the ALJ's decision within 30 days of receipt of the ALJ's decision, by filing a request for review with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for ACF.

    (2) The Assistant Secretary for ACF has discretion, within 30 days after receiving a timely submission by a substantiated perpetrator of a request for review of an ALJ's decision under § 412.102(e)(1) to review the ALJ's decision to dismiss a case for untimeliness or other procedural defects, and to affirm, modify, or reverse the ALJ's decision with regard to dismissal or ORR's disposition of the allegation. A review by the Assistant Secretary will determine whether the ALJ's decision was based on a material error of law or fact.

    (3) If the Assistant Secretary affirms the ALJ's decision or does not modify or reverse the ALJ's decision within 30 days after receiving a timely review request pursuant to § 412.102(e)(1), the ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Assistant Secretary and is binding on the parties.

    (4) If the Assistant Secretary modifies or reverses the ALJ's decision pursuant to § 412.102(e)(2), the Assistant Secretary's decision is final and binding.

    (5) If at the end of the 30-day period in § 412.102(e)(1), no timely request for review has been made, the Assistant Secretary has 30 days from that point to exercise discretion to review the ALJ's decision. If the Assistant Secretary does not modify or reverse the ALJ's decision, then the ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Assistant Secretary and is binding on both parties.

    (6) The Office of the Assistant Secretary for ACF shall serve a copy of the final decision upon the parties involved. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for ACF also shall provide a copy of the final decision issued by the Assistant Secretary, based on review of the ALJ's decision under this paragraph (e), to the alleged victim and the alleged victim's parent(s), legal guardian(s) (as appropriate), or sponsor(s).
