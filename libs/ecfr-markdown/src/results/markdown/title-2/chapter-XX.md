    Subpart A—General

      § 2000.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 2000.10

      This part promulgates a regulation adopting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, establishing the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. NRC thereby gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance. It also supplements the OMB guidance by identifying NRC implementing officials and identifying how to pass these requirements through to other entities.

      § 2000.20   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 2000.20

      This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to:

      (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction”;

      (b) Respondent in an NRC nonprocurement suspension or debarment action;

      (c) NRC debarment or suspension official; or

      (d) NRC grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into a covered nonprocurement transaction.

      § 2000.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 2000.30

      (a) The NRC policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in Subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, and those in this part. The NRC has closely tracked OMB's numbering scheme. For example, the contracts under a nonprocurement transaction that are covered transactions that are in section 220 of the OMB guidance ( 2 CFR 180.220) are found in § 2000.220.

      (b) For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, NRC requirements are those in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180.

      § 2000.135   Who in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 2000.135

      The Director, Office of Administration or another official designated by the Director, has the authority to grant a written exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in guidance at 2 CFR 180.135. The Director or other official designated by the Director shall explain the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 2000.220   What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

#### § § 2000.220

      The NRC nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements apply only to first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      § 2000.330   What method must be used to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers?

#### § § 2000.330

      A participant in a covered transaction must include a term or condition in any lower-tier covered transaction to require the participant of that transaction to—

      (a) Comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180; and

      (b) Include a similar term or condition in any covered transaction into which it enters at the next lower tier.

    Subparts D-H [Reserved]

    Subpart I—Definitions

      § 2000.930   Debarring official.

#### § § 2000.930

      The Debarring Official for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the Director, Office of Administration.

      § 2000.1010   Suspending official.

#### § § 2000.1010

      The suspending official for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the Director, Office of Administration.
