      § 800.101   Scope.

#### § § 800.101

      (a) Section 721 of title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4565), authorizes the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review any covered transaction, as defined in § 800.213 of this part, and to mitigate any risk to the national security of the United States that arises as a result of such transactions. Section 721 also authorizes the President to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction when, in the President's judgment, there is credible evidence that leads the President to believe that the foreign person engaging in a covered transaction might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States, and when provisions of law other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 ) do not, in the judgment of the President, provide adequate and appropriate authority for the President to protect the national security of the United States in the matter before the President.

      (b) This part implements regulations pertaining to covered transactions. Regulations pertaining to “covered real estate transactions” are addressed in part 802 of this chapter.

      § 800.102   Risk-based analysis.

#### § § 800.102

      Any determination of the Committee with respect to a covered transaction to suspend, refer to the President, or to negotiate, enter into or impose, or enforce any agreement or condition under section 721 shall be based on a risk-based analysis, conducted by the Committee, of the effects on the national security of the United States of the covered transaction. Any such risk-based analysis shall include credible evidence demonstrating the risk and an assessment of the threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences to national security related to the transaction. For purposes of this part, any such analysis of risk shall include and be informed by consideration of the following elements:

      (a) The  which is a function of the intent and capability of a foreign person to take action to impair the national security of the United States;

      (b) The  which are the extent to which the nature of the U.S. business presents susceptibility to impairment of national security; and

      (c) The  which are the potential effects on national security that could reasonably result from the exploitation of the vulnerabilities by the threat actor.

      (e) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A is a U.S. business. A U.S. investor owns 50 percent of the voting interest in Corporation A, and the remaining voting interest is owned in equal shares by five unrelated foreign investors. The foreign investors jointly financed their investment in Corporation A and vote as a single block on matters affecting Corporation A. The foreign investors have an informal arrangement to act in concert with regard to Corporation A, and, as a result, the foreign investors control Corporation A.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(1) of this section with regard to the composition of Corporation A's shareholders. The foreign investors in Corporation A have no contractual or other commitments to act in concert, and have no informal arrangements to do so. Assuming no other relevant facts, the foreign investors do not control Corporation A.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, is a private equity fund that routinely acquires equity interests in companies and manages them for a period of time. Corporation B is a U.S. business. In addition to its acquisition of seven percent of Corporation B's voting shares, Corporation A acquires the right to terminate significant contracts of Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a nine percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. As part of the transaction, Corporation A also acquires certain veto rights that determine important matters affecting Corporation B, including the right to veto the dismissal of senior executives of Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 13 percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, and the right to appoint one member of Corporation B's seven-member board of directors. Corporation A receives minority shareholder protections listed in paragraph (c) of this section but receives no other positive or negative rights with respect to Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not control Corporation B.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 20 percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. Corporation A has negotiated an irrevocable passivity agreement that completely precludes it from controlling Corporation B. Corporation A does, however, receive the right to prevent Corporation B from entering into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates and to prevent Corporation B from guaranteeing the obligations of majority investors or their affiliates. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not control Corporation B.

      (7)  Limited Partnership A comprises two limited partners, each of which holds 49 percent of the interest in the partnership, and a general partner, which holds two percent of the interest. The general partner has sole authority to determine, direct, and decide all important matters affecting the partnership and a fund operated by the partnership. The general partner alone controls Limited Partnership A and the fund.

      (8)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, except that each of the limited partners has the authority to veto major investments proposed by the general partner and to choose the fund's representatives on the boards of the fund's portfolio companies. The general partner and the limited partners each have control over Limited Partnership A and the fund.

      § 800.209   Conversion.

#### § § 800.209

      The term  means the exercise of a right inherent in the ownership or holding of a particular financial instrument to exchange any such instrument for an equity interest.

      § 800.211   Covered investment.

#### § § 800.211

      The term  means an investment, direct or indirect, by a foreign person other than an excepted investor, in an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that is proposed or pending on or after February 13, 2020, and that:

      (a) Is not a covered control transaction; and

      (b) Affords the foreign person:

      (1) Access to any material nonpublic technical information in the possession of the TID U.S. business;

      (2) Membership or observer rights on, or the right to nominate an individual to a position on, the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the TID U.S. business; or

      (3) Any involvement, other than through voting of shares, in substantive decisionmaking of the TID U.S. business regarding:

      (i) The use, development, acquisition, safekeeping, or release of sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens maintained or collected by the TID U.S. business;

      (ii) The use, development, acquisition, or release of critical technologies; or

      (iii) The management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, no investment involving an air carrier, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(2), that holds a certificate issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 shall be a covered investment.

      (d) Example: Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, makes a non-controlling investment in Corporation B, a U.S. business, that affords Corporation A the right to nominate one of the directors on Corporation B's board of directors. Corporation B, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Corporation X, designs and manufactures a critical technology. Corporation A's investment in Corporation B is a covered investment.

#### § § 800.212

      The term  means, in the context of a particular covered investment, the systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part.

      The term  means any of the following:

      (a) A covered control transaction;

      (b) A covered investment;

      (d) Any other transaction, transfer, agreement, or arrangement, the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent the application of section 721.

      (e) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 10 percent non-controlling equity interest in Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation X subsequently provides Corporation A the right to appoint the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Technical Officer of Corporation X. Corporation A does not acquire any additional equity interest in Corporation X. Assuming no other relevant facts, the change in rights is a covered transaction.

      (2)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquires a 10 percent non-controlling equity interest in Corporation X, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business, but Corporation A is not afforded any of the access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b) at the time of its investment. Corporation X later expands its board of directors and provides Corporation A with the right to appoint a director. Assuming no other relevant facts, the change in rights is a covered transaction.

      (3)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign national. With a view towards circumventing section 721, Corporation A transfers money to a U.S. citizen, who, pursuant to informal arrangements with Corporation A and on its behalf, purchases all the shares in Corporation X, a U.S. business. The transaction is a covered transaction.

      (4)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state, is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign national, and is not an excepted investor. With a view towards circumventing section 721, Corporation A transfers money to a U.S. citizen, who, pursuant to informal arrangements with Corporation A and on its behalf, makes a non-controlling minority equity investment in Corporation X, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that maintains and collects sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens. In connection with the investment, the U.S. citizen is afforded the right to be involved in substantive decisionmaking regarding the release of sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens maintained by Corporation X. The transaction is a covered transaction.

      (vi) Has been a respondent or party in a final order, including a settlement order, issued by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regarding violations of U.S. export control laws administered by BIS, including the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4801 ), the EAR, or of any executive order, regulation, order, directive, or license issued pursuant thereto;

      (vii) Has received a final decision from the Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration imposing a civil penalty with respect to a violation of section 57b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as implemented under 10 CFR part 810; or

      (viii) Has been convicted of, or has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement or non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice with respect to, any felony in any jurisdiction within the United States; or

      (2) The foreign person, any of its parents, or any entity of which it is a parent is, on the date on which the parties to the transaction first execute a binding written agreement, or other binding document, establishing the material terms of the transaction, listed on either the BIS Unverified List or Entity List in 15 CFR part 744.

      (d) Irrespective of whether the foreign person satisfies the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section as of the completion date, if at any time during the three-year period following the completion date, the foreign person no longer meets all the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the foreign person is not an excepted investor with respect to the transaction from the completion date onward. This paragraph does not apply when an excepted investor no longer meets any of the criteria solely due to a rescission of a determination under § 800.1001(b) or if the relevant foreign state otherwise ceases to be an excepted foreign state.

      (e) A foreign person may waive its status as an excepted investor with respect to a transaction at any time by submitting a declaration under § 800.403 or filing a notice under § 800.501 regarding the transaction in which it explicitly waives such status. In such case, the foreign person will be deemed not to be an excepted investor with respect to the transaction and the relevant provisions of subpart D or E will apply.

      § 800.220   Foreign entity.

#### § § 800.220

      (a) The term  means any branch, partnership, group or sub-group, association, estate, trust, corporation or division of a corporation, or organization organized under the laws of a foreign state if either its principal place of business is outside the United States or its equity securities are primarily traded on one or more foreign exchanges.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any branch, partnership, group or sub-group, association, estate, trust, corporation or division of a corporation, or organization that can demonstrate that a majority of the equity interest in such entity is ultimately owned by U.S. nationals is not a foreign entity.

      § 800.221   Foreign government.

#### § § 800.221

      The term  means any government or body exercising governmental functions, other than the U.S. Government or a subnational government of the United States. The term includes, but is not limited to, national and subnational governments, including their respective departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.

      § 800.222   Foreign government-controlled transaction.

#### § § 800.222

      The term  means any covered control transaction that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign government or a person controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government.

      § 800.223   Foreign national.

#### § § 800.223

      The term  means any individual other than a U.S. national.

      § 800.224   Foreign person.

#### § § 800.224

      (a) The term  means:

      (1) Any foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity; or

      (2) Any entity over which control is exercised or exercisable by a foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity.

      (b) Any entity over which control is exercised or exercisable by a foreign person is a foreign person.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is engaged in business only outside the United States. All of its shares are held by Corporation X, which solely controls Corporation A. Corporation X is organized in the United States and is wholly owned and controlled by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A, although organized and operating only outside the United States, is not a foreign entity due to § 800.220(b) and is not a foreign person.

      (2)  Same facts as the first sentence of the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The government of the foreign state under whose laws Corporation A is organized exercises control over Corporation A because a law establishing Corporation A gives the foreign state the right to appoint Corporation A's board members. Corporation A is a foreign person.

      (3)  Corporation A is organized in the United States, is engaged in interstate commerce in the United States, and is controlled by Corporation X. Corporation X is organized under the laws of a foreign state, its principal place of business is located outside the United States, and 50 percent of its shares are held by foreign nationals and 50 percent of its shares are held by U.S. nationals. Both Corporation A and Corporation X are foreign persons. Corporation A is also a U.S. business.

      (4)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is owned and controlled by a foreign national. A branch of Corporation A engages in interstate commerce in the United States. Corporation A (including its branch) is a foreign person. The branch is also a U.S. business.

      (5)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and its principal place of business is located outside the United States. Forty-five percent of the equity interest in Corporation A is owned in equal shares by numerous unrelated foreign investors, none of whom has control. The foreign investors have no formal or informal arrangement with any other holder of equity interest in Corporation A to act in concert regarding Corporation A. Corporation A can demonstrate that the remainder of the equity interest in Corporation A is ultimately held by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a foreign entity or foreign person.

      (6)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, except that one of the foreign investors, a foreign national, controls Corporation A. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a foreign entity due to § 800.220(b), but it is a foreign person under paragraph (a)(2) of this section because it is controlled by a foreign national.

      § 800.225   Hold.

#### § § 800.226

      The term  means data that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, including through the use of any personal identifier. Aggregated data or anonymized data is _identifiable data_ if any party to the transaction has, or as a result of the transaction will have, the ability to disaggregate or de-anonymize the data, or if the data is otherwise capable of being used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity. Identifiable data does not include encrypted data, unless the U.S. business that maintains or collects the encrypted data has the means to de-encrypt the data so as to distinguish or trace an individual's identity.

      § 800.227   Investment.

#### § § 800.227

      The term  means any entity that is an “investment company,” as defined in section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 ), or would be an “investment company” but for one or more of the exemptions provided in section 3(b) or 3(c) thereunder.

      § 800.229   Involvement.

#### § § 800.229

      The term  means the right or ability to participate, whether or not exercised, including by doing any of the following:

      (a) Providing input into a final decision;

      (b) Consulting with or providing advice to a decisionmaker;

      (c) Exercising special approval or veto rights;

      (d) Participating on a committee with decisionmaking authority; or

#### § § 800.231

      Solely for the purposes of column 2 of appendix A to this part, the term  means to produce or reproduce, whether physically or virtually.

      § 800.232   Material nonpublic technical information.

#### § § 800.232

      (a) The term  means information that:

      (1) Provides knowledge, know-how, or understanding, in each case not available in the public domain, of the design, location, or operation of covered investment critical infrastructure, including vulnerability information such as that related to physical security or cybersecurity; or

      (2) Is not available in the public domain and is necessary to design, fabricate, develop, test, produce, or manufacture a critical technology, including processes, techniques, or methods.

      (b) The term  does not include financial information regarding the performance of an entity.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Corporation B is a U.S. business that services an industrial control system utilized by an interstate oil pipeline that has the capacity to transport 600,000 barrels per day of crude oil (ICS B). ICS B is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. The source code for ICS B is not available in the public domain. Pursuant to the terms of the investment, Corporation A will have access to the source code for ICS B. The proposed investment therefore affords Corporation A access to material nonpublic technical information in the possession of Corporation B regarding the design and operation of covered investment critical infrastructure.

      (2)  Fund A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a five percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Corporation B is an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that develops a critical technology (Technology Z). Pursuant to the terms of the investment, Corporation B will notify Fund A when it achieves the developmental milestone of completing a demonstration prototype of Technology Z. The notification will only set out the milestone achieved and will not include technical details. Assuming no other facts, the proposed investment does not afford Fund A access to material nonpublic technical information in the possession of Corporation B necessary to design, fabricate, develop, test, produce, or manufacture a critical technology.

      § 800.233   Minimum excepted ownership.

#### § § 800.233

      The term  means:

      (a) With respect to an entity whose equity securities are primarily traded on an exchange in an excepted foreign state or the United States, a majority of its voting interest, the right to a majority of its profits, and the right in the event of dissolution to a majority of its assets; and

      (b) With respect to an entity whose equity securities are not primarily traded on an exchange in an excepted foreign state or the United States, 80 percent or more of its voting interest, the right to 80 percent or more of its profits, and the right in the event of dissolution to 80 percent or more of its assets.

      § 800.234   Own.

#### § § 800.234

      Solely for the purposes of column 2 of appendix A to this part, the term  means to directly possess the applicable covered investment critical infrastructure.

      § 800.235   Parent.

#### § § 800.235

      (a) The term  means, with respect to an entity:

      (1) A person who or which directly or indirectly:

      (i) Holds or will hold at least 50 percent of the outstanding voting interest in the entity; or

      (ii) Holds or will hold the right to at least 50 percent of the profits of the entity, or has or will have the right in the event of dissolution to at least 50 percent of the assets of the entity; or

      (2) The general partner, managing member, or equivalent of the entity.

      (b) Any entity that meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to another entity ( the intermediate parent) is also a parent of any other entity of which the intermediate parent is a parent.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation P holds 50 percent of the voting interest in Corporations R and S; Corporation R holds 40 percent of the voting interest in Corporation X; and Corporation S holds 50 percent of the voting interest in Corporation Y, which in turn holds 50 percent of the voting interest in Corporation Z. Corporation P is a parent of Corporations R, S, Y, and Z, but not of Corporation X. Corporation S is a parent of Corporation Y and Z, and Corporation Y is a parent of Corporation Z.

      (2)  Corporation A holds warrants which when exercised will entitle it to vote 50 percent of the outstanding shares of Corporation B. Corporation A is a parent of Corporation B.

      (3)  Investor A holds 60 percent of the outstanding voting interest in Corporation B. Investor C holds the right to 80 percent of the profits of Corporation B. Each of Investor A and Investor C is a parent of Corporation B.

      § 800.236   Party to a transaction.

#### § § 800.236

      (a) The term  means:

      (2) In the case of a merger, the surviving entity, and the entity or entities that are merged with or into that entity in the transaction;

      (3) In the case of a consolidation, the entities being consolidated, and the new consolidated entity;

      (6) In the case of a change in rights that a person has with respect to an entity in which that person has an investment, the person whose rights change as a result of the transaction and the entity to which those rights apply;

      (7) In the case of any other transaction, transfer, agreement, or arrangement, the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent the application of section 721, any person that participates in such transaction, transfer, agreement, or arrangement;

      (8) In the case of any other type of transaction, any person who is in a role comparable to that of a person described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section; and

      (9) In all cases, each party that submitted a declaration or notice to the Committee regarding a transaction.

      (b) For purposes of section 721(l), the term  includes any affiliate of any party described in paragraph (a) of this section that the Committee, or a lead agency acting on behalf of the Committee, determines is relevant to mitigating a risk to the national security of the United States.

      § 800.241   Sensitive personal data.

#### § § 800.241

      (a) The term  means, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section:

      (1) Identifiable data that is:

      (i) Maintained or collected by a U.S. business that:

      (A) Targets or tailors products or services to any U.S. executive branch agency or military department with intelligence, national security, or homeland security responsibilities, or to personnel and contractors thereof;

      (B) Has maintained or collected any identifiable data within one or more categories described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section on greater than one million individuals at any point over the twelve (12) months preceding the earliest of the completion date, the date of any of the events described in § 800.104(b)(2) through (4) (as applicable), or the date of filing of a written notice or submission of a declaration, unless the U.S. business can demonstrate that at the time of the completion date of the transaction it had or will have neither the capability to maintain nor the capability to collect any identifiable data within one or more categories described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section on greater than one million individuals; or

      (C) Has a demonstrated business objective to maintain or collect any identifiable data within one or more categories described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section on greater than one million individuals and such data is an integrated part of the U.S. business's primary products or services; and

      (ii) Within any of the following categories:

      (A) Financial data that could be used to analyze or determine an individual's financial distress or hardship;

      (B) The set of data in a consumer report, as defined under 15 U.S.C. 1681a, unless such data is obtained from a consumer reporting agency for one or more purposes identified in 15 U.S.C. 1681b(a) and such data is not substantially similar to the full contents of a consumer file as defined under 15 U.S.C. 1681a;

      (C) The set of data in an application for health insurance, long-term care insurance, professional liability insurance, mortgage insurance, or life insurance;

      (D) Data relating to the physical, mental, or psychological health condition of an individual;

      (E) Non-public electronic communications, including email, messaging, or chat communications, between or among users of a U.S. business's products or services if a primary purpose of such product or service is to facilitate third-party user communications;

      (F) Geolocation data collected using positioning systems, cell phone towers, or WiFi access points such as via a mobile application, vehicle GPS, other onboard mapping tool, or wearable electronic device;

      (G) Biometric enrollment data including facial, voice, retina/iris, and palm/fingerprint templates;

      (H) Data stored and processed for generating a state or federal government identification card;

      (I) Data concerning U.S. Government personnel security clearance status; or

      (J) The set of data in an application for a U.S. Government personnel security clearance or an application for employment in a position of public trust; and

      (2) The results of an individual's genetic tests, including any related genetic sequencing data, whenever such results constitute identifiable data. Such results shall not include data derived from databases maintained by the U.S. Government and routinely provided to private parties for purposes of research. For purposes of this paragraph, “genetic test” shall have the meaning provided in 42 U.S.C. 300gg-91(d)(17).

      (b) The term  shall not include, regardless of the applicability of the criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) Data maintained or collected by a U.S. business concerning the employees of that U.S. business, unless the data pertains to employees of U.S. Government contractors who hold U.S. Government personnel security clearances; or

      (2) Data that is a matter of public record, such as court records or other government records that are generally available to the public.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, periodically collects geolocation data as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) of this section on its customers for marketing and customer experience purposes. Corporation A maintains the geolocation data for a short period, then purges the data from its systems. When Corporation A and a foreign person notify the Committee of a transaction, Corporation A maintains the geolocation data of only 200,000 individuals. However, in the 12 months prior to filing the notification to the Committee, Corporation A has collected the geolocation data of greater than one million individuals. Because Corporation A collected the geolocation data of greater than one million individuals in the 12 months prior to the filing date of the notice, it meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (2)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, collects data relating to physical health conditions as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) from new customers, which numbered fewer than one million over the 12 months prior to executing a definitive binding agreement to be acquired by a foreign person. Under its data retention policy, Corporation A maintains the health data for a long period of time. Accordingly, Corporation A maintains the health data from new customers (those from whom the data was collected in the previous 12 months) and older customers (those from whom the data was collected in prior years). In total, Corporation A maintains the health data of three million individuals. Because Corporation A maintains health data of greater than one million individuals, it meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (3)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that, under its data retention policy, the number of individuals for whom Corporation A maintains the health data fluctuates. Over the 12 months prior to executing a definitive binding agreement to be acquired by a foreign person, Corporation A usually maintained the health data of 900,000 individuals. However, at one point during the prior 12 months, it maintained the health data of 1,100,000 individuals. Corporation A currently maintains the health data of fewer than one million individuals. Because Corporation A maintained the health data of greater than one million individuals during the 12 months prior to executing a definitive binding agreement to be acquired by a foreign person, it meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (4)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, maintains data under multiple categories in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section on over one million individuals. Specifically, Corporation A maintains financial data described by paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section on 400,000 individuals, and health data described by paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of this section on another 700,000 individuals. Because Corporation A maintains the data described in the categories in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) on greater than one million individuals, despite not maintaining or collecting data of greater than one million individuals in any one category, it meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

      (5)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, is a start-up mobile mapping venture that has maintained or collected geolocation data described by paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) of this section on substantially fewer than one million individual subscribers over the 12 months prior to completing a transaction with a foreign person. The geolocation data is an integrated part of Corporation A's primary product, mobile mapping services. Corporation A, in connection with attempting to secure an additional round of financing, has prepared and distributed to potential investors pitch materials that include Corporation A's projection that, within the next two years, it will have greater than one million active individual subscribers. Corporation A also has made plans to substantially increase its workforce and enhance its IT infrastructure in anticipation of obtaining the additional subscribers. Corporation A meets the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section of having a demonstrated business objective to maintain or collect data described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (J) of this section on greater than one million individuals.

      § 800.242   Service.

#### § § 800.242

      Solely for the purposes of column 2 of appendix A to this part, the term  means to repair, maintain, refurbish, replace, overhaul, or update.

      § 800.243   Solely for the purpose of passive investment.

#### § § 800.243

      (a) Ownership interests are held or acquired  if the person holding or acquiring such interests does not plan or intend to exercise control and—

      (1) Is not afforded any rights that if exercised would constitute control;

      (2) Does not acquire any access, rights, or involvement specified § 800.211(b);

      (3) Does not possess or develop any purpose other than passive investment; and

      (4) Does not take any action inconsistent with holding or acquiring such interests solely for the purpose of passive investment. (See § 800.302(b).)

      (b) Example: Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a voting interest in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the voting interest, Corporation A negotiates the right to appoint a member of Corporation B's board of directors. The acquisition by Corporation A of a voting interest in Corporation B is not solely for the purpose of passive investment.

      § 800.244   Substantial interest.

#### § § 800.244

      (a) The term  means, in the context of an acquisition of an interest in a U.S. business by a foreign person, a voting interest, direct or indirect, of 25 percent or more, and, in the context of a foreign person in which the national or subnational governments of a single foreign state have an interest, subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a voting interest, direct or indirect, of 49 percent or more.

      (b) In the case of an entity whose activities are primarily directed, controlled, or coordinated by or on behalf of a general partner, managing member, or equivalent, the national or subnational governments of a single foreign state will be considered to have  in such entity only if they hold 49 percent or more of the interest in the general partner, managing member, or equivalent of the entity.

      (c) For purposes of determining the percentage of interest held indirectly by one entity in another entity under this section, any interest of a parent will be deemed to be a 100 percent interest in any entity of which it is a parent.

      (d) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, plans to acquire a 30 percent voting interest in Corporation X, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Corporation B holds 51 percent of the voting interest in, and is a parent of, Corporation A. A foreign government holds 75 percent of the voting interest in Corporation B, and private, non-government controlled individuals hold the remaining 25 percent. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation B is deemed to have 100 percent of the voting interest in Corporation A because it is Corporation A's parent, and therefore the foreign government's indirect voting interest in Corporation A is imputed to be 75 percent. Corporation A is acquiring a substantial interest in Corporation X, and a foreign government has a substantial interest in Corporation A.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that Corporation B holds only 49 percent of the voting interest in Corporation A and is not Corporation A's parent. Because Corporation B is not a parent of Corporation A, paragraph (c) of this section is not applicable. The foreign government's indirect voting interest in Corporation A for purposes of this section is only 36.75 percent. Corporation A is acquiring a substantial interest in Corporation X; however, the foreign government does not have a substantial interest in Corporation A.

      (a) The term  means the process through which decisions regarding significant matters affecting an entity are undertaken, including, as applicable:

      (1) Pricing, sales, and specific contracts, including the license, sale, or transfer of sensitive personal data to any third party, including pursuant to a customer, vendor, or joint venture agreement;

      (2) Supply arrangements;

      (3) Corporate strategy and business development;

      (4) Research and development, including location and budget allocation;

      (5) Manufacturing locations;

      (6) Access to critical technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, material nonpublic technical information, or sensitive personal data, including pursuant to a customer, vendor, or joint venture agreement;

      (7) Physical and cyber security protocols, including the storage and protection of critical technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, or sensitive personal data;

      (8) Practices, policies, and procedures governing the collection, use, or storage of sensitive personal data, including:

      (i) The establishment or maintenance of, or changes to, the architecture of information technology systems and networks used in collecting or maintaining sensitive personal data; or

      (ii) Privacy policies and agreements for individuals from whom sensitive personal data is collected setting forth parameters regarding whether and how sensitive personal data may be collected, maintained, accessed, or disseminated; or

      (9) Strategic partnerships.

      (b) The term  does not include strictly administrative decisions.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Corporation B is an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that operates a container terminal at a strategic seaport within the National Port Readiness Network (Terminal B). Pursuant to the terms of the investment, Corporation A will have approval rights over which customers may utilize Terminal B. The proposed investment therefore affords Corporation A involvement in substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B regarding the management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that instead of customer approval rights, Corporation A has the right to decide whether to claim certain tax credits with respect to Terminal B on its own income tax filing, which prevents Corporation B from claiming such credits. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed investment does not afford Corporation A involvement in substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B regarding the management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.

      § 800.246   Supply.

#### § § 800.246

      Solely for the purposes of column 2 of appendix A to this part, the term  means to provide third-party physical or cyber security.

#### § § 800.247

      (a) The term  means customizing products or services for use by a person or group of persons or actively marketing to or soliciting a person or group of persons.

      (b) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, operates facilities throughout the United States that offer healthcare-related products and services. Some of Corporation A's facilities are located within metropolitan areas that also include U.S. military facilities. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not target or tailor its products or services for purposes of § 800.241(a)(1)(i)(A).

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that Corporation A operates a facility on the premises of a U.S. military facility. Corporation A targets or tailors its products or services for purposes of § 800.241(a)(1)(i)(A).

      (3)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, offers a discount to all customers that are employed in the public sector broadly, including active duty U.S. military personnel. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not target or tailor its products or services for purposes of § 800.241(a)(1)(i)(A).

      (4)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except that Corporation A offers a discount solely to uniformed U.S. military personnel and distributes marketing materials that promote the particular usefulness of Corporation A's products to military personnel. Corporation A targets or tailors its products or services for purposes of § 800.241(a)(1)(i)(A).

      § 800.248   TID U.S. business.

#### § § 800.248

      The term  means any U.S. business that:

      (a) Produces, designs, tests, manufactures, fabricates, or develops one or more critical technologies;

      (b) Performs the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to covered investment critical infrastructure; or

      (c) Maintains or collects, directly or indirectly, sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens.

      (d) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, operates a munitions plant in the United States that produces a variety of military grade explosives. Some of the explosives manufactured by Corporation A are listed on the USML. Corporation A manufactures critical technologies and is therefore a TID U.S. business.

      (2)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, produces an item (Item A) by purchasing various components from third-party suppliers and integrating them into Item A. One of these components (Component X) is a critical technology, but Item A is not a critical technology. Before integrating Component X into Item A, Corporation A merely verifies the fit and form of Component X solely as part of Item A. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not test critical technologies and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (3)  Corporation A is a U.S. business that owns intellectual property rights and equipment for manufacturing a critical technology and maintains the know-how to manufacture that critical technology. It has been six months since Corporation A manufactured the critical technology. Because Corporation A retains the ability to manufacture the critical technology, Corporation A is a TID U.S. business.

      (4)  Facility A is a crude oil storage facility with the capacity to hold 50 million barrels of crude oil. Corporation A is a U.S. business that operates Facility A. Corporation B is a U.S. business that provides third-party physical security to Facility A by guarding the gate to Facility A and patrolling the fence surrounding Facility A. Corporation C produces the fencing used by Facility A. Corporation D produces the commercially available off-the-shelf cyber security software utilized in Facility A. Corporation E provides third-party cyber security to Facility A by running Facility A's cyber security defenses. Facility A is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A, Corporation B, and Corporation E each perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Facility A, and each is therefore a TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, neither Corporation C nor Corporation D performs one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Facility A, and neither is therefore a TID U.S. business.

      (5)  Pipeline A is an interstate natural gas pipeline with an outside diameter of 36 inches. Corporation A is a U.S. business that owns Pipeline A. Corporation B is a U.S. business that manufactures the pipe segments with an outside diameter of 36 inches that are used in Pipeline A. Pipeline A is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A performs one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Pipeline A and is therefore a TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Pipeline A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (6)  IXP A is an internet exchange point that supports public peering. Corporation A is a U.S. business that operates IXP A. Corporation B is a U.S. business that maintains the physical premises of IXP A. IXP A is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A performs one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to IXP A and is therefore a TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to IXP A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (7)  SCADA System A is a supervisory control and data acquisition system utilized by a public water system, as defined in section 1401(4) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 300f(4)(A)), that regularly serves 15,000 individuals. Corporation A is a U.S. business that produces SCADA System A by building the hardware and integrating all the software. Corporation B is a U.S. business that produces commercially available off-the-shelf software that is sold to Corporation A and used as a component in SCADA System A. SCADA System A is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A, as the manufacturer of SCADA System A, performs one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to SCADA System A and is therefore a TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to SCADA System A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (8)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. Corporation B later releases a patch that updates the commercially available off-the-shelf software that is a component of SCADA System A. As the software is only a component of SCADA System A, the software itself is not covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to SCADA System A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (9)  Alloy A is a steel alloy containing two percent manganese. Corporation A is a U.S. business that manufactures Alloy A in Facility A by melting the constituent metals. Facility A is in the United States. Corporation B is a U.S. business that purchases Alloy A from Corporation A and resells it to a prime contractor of the Department of Defense. Facility A is covered investment critical infrastructure as set forth in column 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A performs one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Alloy A and is therefore a TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B does not perform one of the functions as set forth in column 2 of appendix A to this part with respect to Alloy A and is therefore not a TID U.S. business.

      (10)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, is a credit reporting agency and maintains consumer reports meeting the description under § 800.241(a)(1)(ii)(B) on greater than one million individuals, including U.S. citizens. Corporation A maintains sensitive personal data and is therefore a TID U.S. business.

      (11)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, except that Corporation A maintains the sensitive personal data through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Corporation X. Corporation A is a TID U.S. business because it indirectly maintains sensitive personal data. Corporation X is also a TID U.S. business because it directly maintains sensitive personal data.

      (12)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, manufactures and sells specialty medical devices to patients with various health conditions. Corporation A solicits certain patient medical information on its five million customers, including U.S. citizens, which is sensitive personal data under § 800.241(a)(1)(ii)(D), for R&D, marketing, and quality assurance purposes. However, Corporation A does not directly maintain or collect this information, but instead outsources this function to a third party, Corporation X, which collects the data according to Corporation A's instructions and maintains the data on Corporation X's corporate servers for Corporation A to access. Corporation A is a TID U.S. business because it indirectly maintains and collects sensitive personal data, and Corporation X is a TID U.S. business because it directly maintains and collects sensitive personal data.

      § 800.249   Transaction.

#### § § 800.249

      The term  means any of the following, whether proposed or completed:

      (b) An investment; or

      (c) The conversion of a contingent equity interest.

      (d) Example: Corporation A, a foreign person, signs a concession agreement to operate the toll road business of Corporation B, a U.S. business, for 99 years. Corporation B, however, is required under the agreement to perform safety and security functions with respect to the business and to monitor compliance by Corporation A with the operating requirements of the agreement on an ongoing basis. Corporation B may terminate the agreement or impose other penalties for breach of these operating requirements. Assuming no other relevant facts, this is not a transaction.

      § 800.250   Unaffiliated TID U.S. business.

#### § § 800.250

      The term  means, with respect to a foreign person, a TID U.S. business in which that foreign person does not directly hold more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting interest or have the right to appoint more than half of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body.

Corporation A and its branch or subsidiary are each also a foreign person.

      (2)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign national. Corporation A does not have a branch office, subsidiary, or fixed place of business in the United States. It exports and licenses technology to an unrelated company in the United States. It also provides remote technical support services to customers that are in the United States, but does not have any assets or personnel located in the United States. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a U.S. business.

    Subpart C—Coverage

      § 800.301   Transactions that are covered control transactions.

#### § § 800.301

      Transactions that are covered control transactions include:

      (a) A transaction which, irrespective of the actual arrangements for control provided for in the terms of the transaction, results or could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person. (See the examples in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section.)

      (b) A transaction in which a foreign person conveys its control of a U.S. business to another foreign person. (See the example in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.)

      (c) A transaction that results or could result in control by a foreign person of any part of an entity or of assets, if such part of an entity or assets constitutes a U.S. business. (See § 800.302(c) and the examples in paragraphs (e)(5) through (14) of this section.)

      (d) A joint venture in which the parties enter into a contractual or other similar arrangement, including an agreement on the establishment of a new entity, but only if one or more of the parties contributes a U.S. business and a foreign person could control that U.S. business by means of the joint venture. (See the examples in paragraphs (e)(15) through (17) of this section.)

      (e) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X, which is a U.S. business. As the sole owner, Corporation A will have the right to elect directors and appoint other primary officers of Corporation X, and those directors will have the right to make decisions about the closing and relocation of particular production facilities and the termination of significant contracts. The directors also will have the right to propose to Corporation A, the sole shareholder, the dissolution of Corporation X and the sale of its principal assets. The proposed transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (2)  Same facts as the example (e)(1) of this section, except that Corporation A plans to retain the existing directors of Corporation X, all of whom are U.S. nationals. Although Corporation A may choose not to exercise its power to elect new directors for Corporation X, Corporation A nevertheless will have that exercisable power. The proposed transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase 50 percent of the voting shares in Corporation X, a U.S. business, from Corporation B, also a U.S. business. The governance documents of Corporation X provide that important decisions require the affirmative vote of more than half of the votes cast. Corporation B would retain the other 50 percent of the shares in Corporation X, and Corporation A and Corporation B would contractually agree that Corporation A would not exercise its voting and other rights for 10 years. The proposed transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (4)  Corporation X is a U.S. business, but is wholly owned and controlled by Corporation Y, a foreign person. Corporation Z, also a foreign person, but not related to Corporation Y, seeks to acquire Corporation X from Corporation Y. The proposed transaction is a covered control transaction because it could result in control of Corporation X, a U.S. business, by another foreign person, Corporation Z.

      (5)  Corporation X, a foreign person, has a branch office located in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to buy that branch office. The proposed transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, buys a branch office located entirely outside the United States of Corporation Y, which is incorporated in the United States. Assuming no other relevant facts, the branch office of Corporation Y is not a U.S. business, and the transaction is not a covered control transaction.

      (7)  Corporation A, a foreign person, makes a start-up, or “greenfield,” investment in the United States. That investment involves activities such as the foreign person separately arranging for the financing of and the construction of a plant to make a new product, buying supplies and inputs, hiring personnel, and purchasing the necessary technology. The investment involves incorporating a newly formed subsidiary of the foreign person. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A will not have acquired a U.S. business, and its greenfield investment is not a covered control transaction. However, this transaction may be subject to the provisions of part 802 of this title, which addresses certain transactions concerning real estate.

      (8)  Corporation A, a foreign person, intends to make an early-stage investment in a start-up company in the United States. Prior to the investment by the foreign person, the start-up has engaged in interstate commerce, including incorporating, establishing a domain name, hiring personnel, developing business plans, seeking financing, and renting office space, without the involvement of the foreign person. As a result of the investment, Corporation A could control the U.S. business. Corporation A is acquiring a U.S. business and the proposed transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (9)  Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases substantially all of the assets of Corporation B. Corporation B, which is incorporated in the United States, was in the business of producing industrial equipment, but stopped producing and selling such equipment one week before Corporation A purchased substantially all of its assets. At the time of the transaction, Corporation B continued to have employees on its payroll, maintained know-how in producing the industrial equipment it previously produced, and maintained relationships with its prior customers, all of which were transferred to Corporation A. Corporation A has acquired a U.S. business and the acquisition is a covered control transaction.

      (10)  Corporation X, a foreign person, seeks to acquire from Corporation A, a U.S. business, an empty warehouse facility located in the United States. The acquisition would be limited to the physical facility, and would not include customer lists, intellectual property, or other proprietary information, or other intangible assets or the transfer of personnel. Assuming no other relevant facts, the facility is not an entity and therefore not a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition of the facility is not a covered control transaction. However, this transaction may be subject to the provisions of part 802 of this chapter, which addresses certain transactions concerning real estate.

      (11)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(10) of this section, except that, in addition to the proposed acquisition of Corporation A's warehouse facility, Corporation X would acquire the personnel, customer list, equipment, and inventory management software used to operate the facility. Under these facts, Corporation X is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition is a covered control transaction.

      (12)  Corporation A, a foreign person, seeks to acquire from Corporation X, a U.S. business, certain tangible and intangible assets that Corporation X operates as a business in the United States. Corporation A intends to use the assets to establish a business undertaking in a foreign country. Under these facts, Corporation X is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition is a covered control transaction.

      (13)  Corporation A, a foreign person, seeks to acquire from Corporation X, a U.S. business, proprietary software developed by Corporation X. The acquisition would be limited to the software and would not include customer lists, marketing material, or other proprietary information; any other tangible or intangible assets; or the transfer of personnel. Assuming no other relevant facts, the software does not constitute an entity and is therefore not a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition of the software is not a covered control transaction.

      (14)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(13) of this section, except that, in addition to the proposed acquisition of Corporation X's proprietary software, Corporation A would acquire Corporation X's customer lists, advertising and promotional material, branding, trademarks, domain names, and internet presence. Under these facts, Corporation A is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition is a covered control transaction.

      (15)  Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which Corporation A contributes only cash and Corporation X contributes a U.S. business. Each owns 50 percent of the shares of JV Corporation and, under the Articles of Incorporation of JV Corporation, both Corporation A and Corporation X have veto power over matters affecting JV Corporation identified under § 800.208, giving them both control over JV Corporation. The place of incorporation of JV Corporation is not relevant to the determination of whether the transaction is a covered control transaction. The formation of JV Corporation is a covered control transaction.

      (16)  Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which Corporation A contributes funding and managerial and technical personnel, while Corporation X contributes certain land and equipment that do not in this example constitute a U.S. business. Corporations A and X each have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture. Assuming no other relevant facts, the formation of JV Corporation is not a covered control transaction. However, this transaction may be subject to the provisions of part 802 of this title, which addresses certain transactions concerning real estate.

      (17)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(16) of this section, except that, in addition to contributing certain land and equipment, Corporation X also contributes intellectual property, other proprietary information, and other intangible assets, that together with the land and equipment constitute a U.S. business, to JV Corporation. Under these facts, Corporation X has contributed a U.S. business, and the formation of JV Corporation is a covered control transaction.

      § 800.302   Transactions that are not covered control transactions.

#### § § 800.302

      Transactions that are not covered control transactions include:

      (a) A stock split or pro rata stock dividend that does not involve a change in control. See the example in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

      (b) A transaction that results in a foreign person holding 10 percent or less of the outstanding voting interest in a U.S. business (regardless of the dollar value of the interest so acquired), but only if the transaction is solely for the purpose of passive investment. (See § 800.243 and the examples in paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) of this section.)

      (c) An acquisition of any part of an entity or of assets, if such part of an entity or assets do not constitute a U.S. business. (See § 800.301(c) and the examples in paragraphs (f)(5) through (10) of this section.)

      (d) An acquisition of securities by a person acting as a securities underwriter, in the ordinary course of business and in the process of underwriting.

      (e) An acquisition pursuant to a condition in a contract of insurance relating to fidelity, surety, or casualty obligations if the contract was made by an insurer in the ordinary course of business.

      (f) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, holds 10,000 shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, constituting 10 percent of the stock of Corporation B. Corporation B pays a 2-for-1 stock dividend. As a result of this stock split, Corporation A holds 20,000 shares of Corporation B, still constituting 10 percent of the stock of Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of additional shares is not a covered control transaction.

      (2)  In an open market purchase solely for the purpose of passive investment, Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires seven percent of the voting securities of Corporation X, which is a U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of the securities is not a covered control transaction.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires nine percent of the voting shares of Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation A also negotiates contractual rights that give it the power to control important matters of Corporation X. The acquisition by Corporation A of the voting shares of Corporation X is not solely for the purpose of passive investment and is a covered control transaction.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires five percent of the voting shares in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the securities, Corporation A obtains the right to appoint one out of eleven seats on Corporation B's board of directors. The acquisition by Corporation A of Corporation B's securities is not solely for the purpose of passive investment. Whether the transaction is a covered control transaction would depend on whether Corporation A obtains control of Corporation B as a result of the transaction. See § 800.303 for transactions that are covered investments.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires, from separate U.S. nationals products held in inventory, land, and machinery for export. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A has not acquired a U.S. business, and this acquisition is not a covered control transaction.

      (6)  Corporation X, a U.S. business, produces armored personnel carriers in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign person, seeks to acquire the annual production of those carriers from Corporation X under a long-term contract. Assuming no other relevant facts, this transaction is not a covered control transaction.

      (7)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, except that Corporation X, a U.S. business, has developed important technology in connection with the production of armored personnel carriers. Corporation A seeks to negotiate an agreement under which it would be licensed to manufacture using that technology. Assuming no other relevant facts, neither the proposed acquisition of technology pursuant to that license agreement, nor the actual acquisition, is a covered control transaction.

      (8)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, except that Corporation A enters into a contractual arrangement to acquire the entire armored personnel carrier business operations of Corporation X, including production facilities, customer lists, technology, and staff, which together constitute a U.S. business. This transaction is a covered control transaction.

      (9)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, except that Corporation X suspended all activities of its armored personnel carrier business a year ago and currently is in bankruptcy proceedings. Existing equipment provided by Corporation X is being serviced by another company, which purchased the service contracts from Corporation X. The business's production facilities are idle but still in working condition, some of its key former employees have agreed to return if the business is resuscitated, and its technology and customer and vendor lists are still current. Corporation X's personnel carrier business constitutes a U.S. business, and its purchase by Corporation A is a covered control transaction.

      (10)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, except that Corporation A and Corporation X establish a joint venture that will be controlled by Corporation A to manufacture armored personnel carriers outside the United States, and Corporation X contributes assets constituting a U.S. business, including intellectual property and other intangible assets required to manufacture the armored personnel carriers, to the joint venture. Corporation X has contributed a U.S. business to the joint venture, and the establishment of the joint venture is a covered control transaction.

      (11)  Corporation A, a foreign person, holds a 10 percent ownership interest in Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation A and Corporation X enter into a contractual arrangement pursuant to which Corporation A gains the right to purchase an additional interest in Corporation X to prevent the dilution of Corporation A's  interest in Corporation X in the event that Corporation X issues additional instruments conveying interests in Corporation X. Corporation A does not acquire any additional rights or ownership interest in Corporation X pursuant to the contractual arrangement. Assuming no other relevant facts, the transaction is not a covered control transaction.

      § 800.303   Transactions that are covered investments.

#### § § 800.303

      Transactions that are covered investments include:

      (a) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211 irrespective of the percentage of voting interest acquired. (See the examples in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.)

      (b) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211, irrespective of the fact that the Committee concluded all action under section 721 for a previous covered investment by the same foreign person in the same TID U.S. business, where such transaction involves the acquisition of access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211 in addition to those notified to the Committee in the transaction for which the Committee previously concluded action. (See the example in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.)

      (c) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211, irrespective of the fact that the critical technology produced, designed, tested, manufactured, fabricated, or developed by the TID U.S. business became controlled under section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 after February 13, 2020, unless any of the criteria set forth in § 800.104(b) are satisfied with respect to the transaction prior to the critical technology becoming controlled. (See the example in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.)

      (d) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an entity in which Corporation A has no voting interests or any rights. Corporation B is a U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology. Corporation B is therefore an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Pursuant to the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. The proposed transaction is a covered investment.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to the terms of the investment, instead of observer rights, Corporation A has consultation rights with respect to Corporation B's licensing of a critical technology to third parties. Corporation A is therefore involved in substantive decisionmaking with respect to Corporation B, and the proposed transaction is a covered investment.

      (3)  Corporation A is a foreign person that is an excepted investor. Corporation B, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, owns a three percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation A. Corporation A proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation C, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Pursuant to the terms of the investment in Corporation C and Corporation A's governance documents, Corporation A and Corporation B will each have access to material nonpublic technical information in Corporation C's possession. The transaction is a covered investment because Corporation B is making an investment that will result in access to material nonpublic technical information under § 800.211(b).

      (4)  The Committee concludes all action under section 721 with respect to a covered investment by Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, in which Corporation A acquires a four percent, non-controlling equity interest with access to material non-public information in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. One year later, Corporation A proposes to acquire an additional five percent equity interest in Corporation B, resulting in Corporation A holding a nine percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Pursuant to the terms of the additional investment, Corporation A will receive the right to appoint a member to the board of directors of Corporation B. The proposed transaction is a covered investment because the transaction involves both an acquisition of an equity interest in an unaffiliated TID U.S. business and a new right under § 800.211.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, has executed a binding written agreement establishing the material terms of a proposed non-controlling investment in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. The proposed investment will afford Corporation A access to material nonpublic technical information in the possession of Corporation B. The only controlled technology produced, designed, tested, manufactured, fabricated, or developed by Corporation B became controlled under section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 after February 13, 2020, but prior to the date upon which the binding written agreement establishing the material terms of the investment was executed. The proposed transaction is a covered investment.

      § 800.304   Transactions that are not covered investments.

#### § § 800.304

      Transactions that are not covered investments include:

      (a) An investment by a foreign person in an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that does not afford the foreign person any of the access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b). (See the examples in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.)

      (b) An investment by a foreign person who is an excepted investor in an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. (See the example in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.)

      (c) A transaction that results or could result in control by a foreign person of an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. (See the example in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.)

      (d) A stock split or pro rata stock dividend that does not afford the foreign person any of the access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b). (See the example in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.)

      (e) An acquisition of securities by a person acting as a securities underwriter, in the ordinary course of business and in the process of underwriting.

      (f) Examples:

      (1)  In an open market purchase solely for the purpose of passive investment, Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquires seven percent of the voting securities of Corporation X, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of the securities is not a covered investment.

      (2)  The Committee concluded all action under section 721 with respect to a covered investment in which Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquired a four percent, non-controlling equity interest with board observer rights in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. One year later, Corporation A proposes to acquire an additional five percent equity interest in Corporation B, which would result in Corporation A holding a nine percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. The proposed investment does not afford Corporation A any additional access, rights, or involvement with respect to Corporation B, including the access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b). Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is not a covered investment.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person who is an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Pursuant to the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is not a covered investment.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign person who is an excepted investor, proposes to purchase all of the shares of Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. As the sole owner, Corporation A will have the right to elect directors and appoint other primary officers of Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is not a covered investment. It is, however, a covered control transaction. Whether Corporation A is an excepted investor and whether Corporation B is an unaffiliated TID U.S. business are not relevant to the determination of whether the transaction is a covered control transaction. (See § 800.301.)

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, holds 10,000 shares and board observer rights in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business, constituting 10 percent of the stock of Corporation B. Corporation B pays a 2-for-1 stock dividend. As a result of this stock split, Corporation A holds 20,000 shares of Corporation B, still constituting 10 percent of the stock of Corporation B. The investment does not afford Corporation A any additional access, rights, or involvement with respect to Corporation B, including those specified in § 800.211(b). Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of additional shares is not a covered investment.

      § 800.305   Incremental acquisitions.

#### § § 800.305

      (a) Any transaction in which a foreign person acquires an additional interest in, or for which a change in rights of the foreign person occurs with respect to, a U.S. business over which the same foreign person, or any entity that it wholly owns directly or indirectly, previously acquired direct control as a result of a covered control transaction for which the Committee concluded all action under section 721 shall be deemed not to be a covered transaction. If, however, a foreign person that did not acquire control of the U.S. business in the prior transaction is a party to the later transaction, the later transaction may be a covered transaction.

      (b) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, directly acquires a 40 percent voting interest and important rights with respect to Corporation B, a U.S. business. The documentation pertaining to the transaction gives no indication that Corporation A's interest in Corporation B may increase at a later date. Corporation A and Corporation B file a voluntary notice of the transaction with the Committee. Following its review of the transaction, the Committee informs the parties that the notified transaction is a covered control transaction, and concludes action under section 721. Three years later, Corporation A acquires the remainder of the voting interest in Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, because the Committee concluded all action with respect to Corporation A's earlier direct acquisition of control in the same U.S. business, and because no other foreign person is a party to this subsequent transaction, this subsequent transaction is not a covered transaction.

      (2)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, makes a covered investment in Corporation B, an unaffiliated U.S. TID business, pursuant to which Corporation A acquires a five percent non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B that affords it access to material nonpublic technical information of Corporation B. Following its review of the transaction, the Committee informs the parties that the notified transaction is a covered investment, and concludes action under section 721. Two years later, Corporation A, in a subsequent investment, acquires an additional five percent non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, which affords Corporation A the right to appoint one board member of Corporation A. The subsequent investment is a covered investment.

      (3)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that instead of Corporation A acquiring the remainder of the voting interest in Corporation B three years after the initial acquisition, the remaining 60 percent voting interest is acquired by Corporation X. Corporation X is wholly owned by Corporation Y. Corporation Y also owns 100 percent of Corporation A. The subsequent transaction may be a covered transaction because, while Corporation A and Corporation X are both under common ownership of Corporation Y, Corporation A (the direct acquirer in the initial transaction) does not wholly own Corporation X.

      § 800.306   Lending transactions.

#### § § 800.306

      (a) The extension of a loan or a similar financing arrangement by a foreign person to a U.S. business, regardless of whether accompanied by the creation in favor of the foreign person of a secured interest over securities or other assets of the U.S. business, shall not, by itself, constitute a covered transaction.

      (1) The Committee will accept notices or declarations concerning a loan or a similar financing arrangement that does not, by itself, constitute a covered transaction only at the time that, because of imminent or actual default or other condition, there is a significant possibility that the foreign person may obtain control of a U.S. business, or acquire equity interest and access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b) over a TID U.S. business, as a result of the default or other condition.

      (2) Where the Committee accepts a notice or declaration concerning a loan or a similar financing arrangement under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and a party to the transaction is a foreign person that makes loans in the ordinary course of business, the Committee will take into account whether the foreign person has made any arrangements to transfer management decisions, or day-to-day control over the U.S. business to U.S. nationals or, as applicable, excepted investors for purposes of determining whether such loan or financing arrangement constitutes a covered transaction.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a loan or a similar financing arrangement through which a foreign person acquires an interest in profits of a U.S. business, the right to appoint members of the board of directors of the U.S. business, or other comparable financial or governance rights characteristic of an equity investment but not of a typical loan may constitute a covered transaction.

      (c) An acquisition of voting interest in or assets of a U.S. business by a foreign person upon default or other condition involving a loan or a similar financing arrangement does not constitute a covered transaction, provided that the loan was made by a syndicate of banks in a loan participation where the foreign lender (or lenders) in the syndicate:

      (1) Needs the majority consent of the U.S. participants in the syndicate to take action, and cannot on its own initiate any action vis-à-vis the debtor; or

      (2) Does not have a lead role in the syndicate, and is subject to a provision in the loan or financing documents limiting its ability to:

      (i) Control the debtor such that control for purposes of § 800.208 could not be acquired; and

      (ii) Exercise any access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b).

      (d) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, which is a U.S. business, borrows funds from Corporation B, a bank organized under the laws of a foreign state and controlled by foreign persons. As a condition of the loan, Corporation A agrees not to sell or pledge its principal assets to any person. Assuming no other relevant facts, this lending arrangement does not alone constitute a covered transaction.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that Corporation A defaults on its loan from Corporation B and seeks bankruptcy protection. Corporation A has no funds with which to satisfy Corporation B's claim, which is greater than the value of Corporation A's principal assets. Corporation B's secured claim constitutes the only secured claim against Corporation A's principal assets, creating a high probability that Corporation B will receive title to Corporation A's principal assets, which constitute a U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the Committee would accept a notice of the impending bankruptcy court adjudication transferring control of Corporation A's principal assets to Corporation B, which would constitute a covered control transaction.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign bank, makes a loan to Corporation B, a U.S. business. The loan documentation provides Corporation A the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Corporation B and the right to be paid dividends by Corporation B. These rights are characteristic of an equity interest but not of a typical loan. Also, as a result of the transaction, under the terms of the loan documentation, Corporation A has the power to determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting Corporation B. This loan is a covered control transaction.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign bank that is not an excepted investor, makes a loan to Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. The loan documentation provides Corporation A the right to appoint one out of fifteen seats on Corporation B's board of directors and the right to be paid dividends by Corporation B. These rights are characteristic of an equity interest but not of a typical loan. However, assuming no other relevant facts under the terms of the loan documentation, Corporation A does not have the power to determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting Corporation B. This loan is a covered investment.

      § 800.307   Specific clarification for investment funds.

#### § § 800.307

      (a) Notwithstanding § 800.303, an indirect investment by a foreign person in a TID U.S. business through an investment fund that affords the foreign person (or a designee of the foreign person) membership as a limited partner or equivalent on an advisory board or a committee of the fund shall not be considered a covered investment if:

      (1) The fund is managed exclusively by a general partner, a managing member, or an equivalent;

      (2) The general partner, managing member, or equivalent of the fund is not a foreign person;

      (3) The advisory board or committee does not have the ability to approve, disapprove, or otherwise control:

      (i) Investment decisions of the investment fund; or

      (ii) Decisions made by the general partner, managing member, or equivalent related to entities in which the investment fund is invested;

      (4) The foreign person does not otherwise have the ability to control the investment fund, including the authority:

      (i) To approve, disapprove, or otherwise control investment decisions of the investment fund;

      (ii) To approve, disapprove, or otherwise control decisions made by the general partner, managing member, or equivalent related to entities in which the investment fund is invested; or

      (iii) To unilaterally dismiss, prevent the dismissal of, select, or determine the compensation of the general partner, managing member, or equivalent;

      (5) The foreign person does not have access to material nonpublic technical information as a result of its participation on the advisory board or committee; and

      (6) The investment does not afford the foreign person any of the access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211(b).

      (b) For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a waiver of a potential conflict of interest, a waiver of an allocation limitation, or a similar activity, applicable to a transaction pursuant to the terms of an agreement governing an investment fund shall not be considered to constitute control of investment decisions of the investment fund or decisions relating to entities in which the investment fund is invested.

      (c) In extraordinary circumstances, the Committee may consider the waiver of a potential conflict of interest, the waiver of an allocation limitation, or a similar activity, applicable to a transaction pursuant to the terms of an agreement governing an investment fund, to constitute control of investment decisions of the investment fund or decisions relating to entities in which the investment fund is invested.

      (d) Example: Limited Partner A, a foreign person, is a limited partner in an investment fund that invests in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. The investment fund is managed exclusively by a general partner, who is not a foreign person. The investment affords Limited Partner A membership on an advisory board of the investment fund. The advisory board provides industry expertise, but it does not control investment decisions of the fund or decisions made by the general partner related to entities in which the fund is invested. Limited Partner A does not otherwise have the ability to control the fund. Limited Partner A's investment in Corporation B does not afford it access to any material nonpublic technical information in the possession of Corporation B, the right to be a member or observer, or to nominate a member or observer, to the board of Corporation B, nor any involvement in the substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B. Assuming no other facts, the indirect investment by Limited Partner A is not a covered investment.

      § 800.308   Timing rule for a contingent equity interest.

#### § § 800.308

      (a) For purposes of determining whether to include the rights that a holder of a contingent equity interest will acquire upon conversion of, or exercise of a right provided by, that interest in the Committee's analysis of whether a notified transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will consider factors that include:

      (1) The imminence of conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions;

      (2) Whether conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions depends on factors within the control of the acquiring party; and

      (3) Whether the amount of interest and the rights that would be acquired upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions can be reasonably determined at the time of acquisition.

      (b) When the Committee, applying paragraph (a) of this section, determines that the rights that the holder will acquire upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent condition will not be included in the Committee's analysis of whether a notified or submitted transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will disregard the contingent equity interest for purposes of that transaction except to the extent that they convey immediate rights to the holder with respect to the entity that issued the interest.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, notifies the Committee that it intends to buy common stock and debentures of Corporation X, a U.S. business. By their terms, the debentures are convertible into common stock only upon the occurrence of an event the timing of which is not in the control of Corporation A, and the number of common shares that would be acquired upon conversion cannot now be determined. Assuming no other relevant facts, the Committee will disregard the debentures in the course of its covered transaction analysis at the time that Corporation A acquires the debentures. In the event that it determines that the acquisition of the common stock is not a covered transaction, the Committee will so inform the parties. Once the conversion of the instruments becomes imminent, it may be appropriate for the Committee to consider the rights that would result from the conversion and whether the conversion is a covered transaction. The conversion of those debentures into common stock could be a covered transaction, depending on what percentage of Corporation X's voting securities Corporation A would receive and what powers those securities would confer on Corporation A.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that the debentures at issue are convertible at the sole discretion of Corporation A after six months, and if converted, would represent a 50 percent interest in Corporation X. The Committee may consider the rights that would result from the conversion as part of its analysis.

    Subpart D—Declarations

      (1) February 13, 2020, or promptly thereafter, if the completion date of the transaction is between February 13, 2020 and March 14, 2020; or

      (2) Thirty days before the completion date of the transaction, if the completion date of the transaction is after March 14, 2020.

      (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (g) of this section, the parties to a covered transaction may complete a transaction subject to a mandatory declaration or notice under this section at any time after having been informed in writing by the Committee that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 or that the Committee is not able to complete action under § 800.407(a)(2).

      (i) In the event that the Committee rejects or permits a withdrawal of a declaration or notice required under this section, the parties shall not complete the transaction earlier than 30 days after the date of the resubmission, except with the written approval of the Staff Chairperson.

      (j) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor and in which no foreign government has a substantial interest, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology. Under the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. Corporation B manufactures the critical technology for commercial off-the-shelf use by businesses in various industries, including some identified in appendix B to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is a covered investment, but is not subject to a mandatory declaration or notice under § 800.401 because Corporation B does not produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop the critical technology specifically for use in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part.

      (2)  Investment Fund A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquires a 10 percent equity interest in Corporation A, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business, and the right to appoint one member of Corporation A's board of directors. Corporation A is manufacturing critical technologies utilized in Corporation A's activity in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part. Investment Fund A satisfies the requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Investment Fund A's investment in Corporation A is a covered investment, but the transaction is not subject to the mandatory declaration requirement.

      (3)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except that in connection with Investment Fund A's transaction, Limited Partner X, a limited partner of Investment Fund A and a foreign national that is not an excepted investor, receives access to the material non-public technical information of Corporation A. Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is a covered investment. While Investment Fund A's direct investment is not subject to a mandatory declaration, Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is subject to a mandatory declaration.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign entity with its principal place of business in Country F, acquires 100 percent of the interests of Corporation Y, a U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology controlled under the EAR. A foreign national of Country G owns 25 percent of the voting shares of Corporation A. Under the EAR, a license is required to export the critical technology to Country G but not Country F. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of Corporation Y is subject to a mandatory declaration.

      (5)  Corporation B, a foreign entity with its principal place of business in Country G, makes a covered investment in Corporation Z, a U.S. business that designs a critical technology controlled under the EAR. Under the EAR, a license is required to export the critical technology to Country G. The license exception at 15 CFR 740.4 authorizes Corporation Z to export the critical technology to Country G without a license. Assuming no other relevant facts, the covered investment is subject to a mandatory declaration.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation B, a U.S. business, execute a binding written agreement pursuant to which Corporation A will acquire a 10 percent equity interest in Corporation B and will be afforded the right to appoint two members of Corporation B's board of directors. As of the date of the agreement, none of the items that Corporation B manufactures constitutes a critical technology. After the agreement is executed, but prior to the completion of the transaction, a product manufactured by Corporation B is included as a defense article on the USML. Assuming no other relevant facts, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the transaction is not subject to a requirement to submit a declaration to the Committee. However for purposes of § 800.211, the transaction may be a covered investment.

      (b)(1) If the Committee determines that a transaction for which no voluntary notice or declaration has been submitted under this part, and with respect to which the Committee has not informed the parties in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721, may be a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations, the Staff Chairperson, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, may request the parties to the transaction or other persons to provide to the Committee information necessary to determine whether the transaction is a covered transaction, whether the transaction may raise national security considerations, or, as appropriate, whether the transaction is a transaction for which a submission is or was required under § 800.401.

      (2) If the Committee determines that a transaction referred to under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations, the Staff Chairperson, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, may request the parties to file a notice of such covered transaction under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) With respect to any transaction:

      (1) Any member of the Committee, or his or her designee at or above the Under Secretary or equivalent level, may, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, file an agency notice to the Committee through the Staff Chairperson regarding a transaction if:

      (i) That member has reason to believe that the transaction is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations and:

      (A) The Committee has not informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction; and

      (B) The President has not announced a decision not to exercise the President's authority under section 721(d) with respect to such transaction; or

      (ii) The transaction is a covered transaction and:

      (A) The Committee has informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction or determined that such transaction is not a covered transaction, or the President has announced a decision not to exercise the President's authority under section 721(d) with respect to such transaction; and

      (B) Either:

      () A party to such transaction submitted false or misleading material information to the Committee in connection with the Committee's consideration of such transaction or omitted material information, including material documents, from information submitted to the Committee; or

      () A party to or the entity resulting from consummation of such transaction materially breaches (or, if the review or investigation of such transaction was initiated under section 7_2_1 before August 13, 2018, intentionally materially breaches) a mitigation agreement or condition described in section 721(l)(3)(A), such breach is certified to the Committee by the lead department or agency monitoring and enforcing such agreement or condition as a material breach (or, if the review or investigation of such transaction was initiated under section 721 before August 13, 2018, an intentional material breach), and the Committee determines that there are no other adequate and appropriate remedies or enforcement tools available to address such breach.

      (2)(i) That is an investment where a foreign person is not an excepted investor due to the application of § 800.219(d), any member of the Committee, or his or her designee at or above the Under Secretary or equivalent level, may file an agency notice to the Committee through the Staff Chairperson regarding such investment if:

      (A) That member has reason to believe that the transaction is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations;

      (B) The Committee has not informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction; and

      (ii) No notice filed under this paragraph (c)(2) shall be made with respect to a transaction more than one year after the completion date of the transaction, unless the Chairperson of the Committee determines, in consultation with other members of the Committee, that because the foreign person no longer meets all the criteria set forth in § 800.219(a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii), the transaction may threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and in no event shall an agency notice under this paragraph be made with respect to such a transaction more than three years after the completion date of the transaction.

      (d) Notices filed under paragraph (c) of this section are deemed accepted upon their receipt by the Staff Chairperson. No agency notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be made with respect to a transaction more than three years after the completion date of the transaction, unless the Chairperson of the Committee, in consultation with other members of the Committee, files such an agency notice.

      (e) No communications other than those described in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section shall constitute the filing or submitting of a notice for purposes of section 721.

      (h) Information and other documentary material provided by the parties to the Committee after the filing of a voluntary notice under this section shall be part of the notice, and shall be subject to the final certification required under § 800.502(m).

      (i) For any voluntarily submitted draft or formal written notice that includes a stipulation under section § 800.502(o) that a transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee shall provide comments on the draft or formal written notice or accept the formal written notice of a covered transaction not later than the date that is 10 business days after the date of submission of the draft or formal written notice.

      (n) Parties filing a voluntary notice shall include with the notice a list identifying each document provided as part of the notice, including all documents provided as attachments or exhibits to the narrative response.

A stipulation offered by any party under this section must be accompanied by a detailed description of the basis for the stipulation. The required description of the basis shall include discussion of all relevant information responsive to paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) through (v) of this section.

Neither the Committee nor the President is bound by any such stipulation, nor does any such stipulation limit the ability of the Committee or the President to act on any authority provided under section 721 with respect to any covered transaction.

      (6) Other such factors the Staff Chairperson may determine to be appropriate in connection with a specific transaction.

      (e) Examples:

      (1)  The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice from Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a company that is owned and controlled by U.S. nationals, with respect to Corporation A's intent to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X. The joint notice does not contain any information described under § 800.502 concerning classified materials and products or services supplied to the U.S. military services. The Staff Chairperson may reject the notice or defer the start of the review period until the parties have supplied the omitted information.

      (2)  Same facts as the first sentence of Example 1 of this section, except that the joint notice indicates that Corporation A does not intend to purchase Corporation X's Division Y, which is engaged in classified work for a U.S. Government agency. Corporations A and X notify the Committee on the 40th day of the 45-day notice period that Division Y will also be acquired by Corporation A. This fact constitutes a material change with respect to the transaction as originally notified, and the Staff Chairperson may reject the notice.

      (3)  The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice by Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, indicating that Corporation A intends to purchase five percent of the voting securities of Corporation X. Under the particular facts and circumstances presented, the Committee concludes that Corporation A's purchase of this interest in Corporation X could not result in a covered investment in or foreign control of Corporation X. The Staff Chairperson shall advise the parties in writing that the transaction as presented is not subject to section 721.

      (4)  The Staff Chairperson receives a voluntary notice involving the acquisition by Company A, a foreign person, of the entire interest in Company X, a U.S. business. The notice mentions the involvement of a second foreign person in the transaction, Company B, but states that Company B is merely a passive investor in the transaction. During the course of the review, the parties provide information that clarifies that Company B has the right to appoint two members of Company X's board of directors. This information contradicts the material assertion in the notice that Company B is a passive investor. The Committee may reject this notice without concluding review under section 721.

      (2) The lead agency recommends, and the Committee concurs, that an investigation be undertaken.

      (b) The Committee shall also undertake, after a review of a covered transaction under § 800.503, an investigation to determine the effects on national security of any covered transaction that:

      (1) Is a foreign government-controlled transaction; or

      (c) In circumstances when the Committee sends a report to the President requesting the President's decision with respect to a covered transaction, such report shall include information relevant to sections 721(d)(4)(A) and (B), and shall present the Committee's recommendation. If the Committee is unable to reach a decision to present a single recommendation to the President, the Chairperson of the Committee shall submit a report of the Committee to the President setting forth the differing views and presenting the issues for decision.

      (d) Upon completion or termination of an investigation, if the Committee determines to conclude all deliberative action under section 721 with regard to a notified covered transaction without sending a report to the President, action under section 721 shall be concluded. An official at the Department of the Treasury shall promptly advise the parties to such a transaction in writing of a determination to conclude action.

      (e) In extraordinary circumstances, the Chairperson may, upon a written request signed by the head of a lead agency, extend an investigation for one 15-day period. A request to extend an investigation must describe, with particularity, the extraordinary circumstances that warrant the Chairperson extending the investigation. The authority of the head of a lead agency to request the extension of an investigation may not be delegated to any person other than the deputy head (or equivalent thereof) of the lead agency. If the Chairperson extends an investigation under this paragraph with respect to a covered transaction, the Committee shall promptly notify the parties to the transaction of the extension.

      (f) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the term  means circumstances for which extending an investigation is necessary and the appropriate course of action, in the Chairperson's discretion, due to a force majeure event or to protect the national security of the United States.

In addition or instead, the matter may be referred to the Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty or damages.

      § 800.1102   Timing of payment.

#### § § 800.1102

      Subject to §§ 800.1106 through 800.1108, the Staff Chairperson shall not accept a formal written notice under § 800.503(a) until payment of any fee required under this subpart is received by the Department of the Treasury in the manner specified on the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website.

      § 800.1103   Valuation.

#### § § 800.1103

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the value of the transaction for purposes of determining the required fee amount in this subpart means the total value of all consideration that has been or will be provided in the context of the transaction by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a party to the transaction, including cash, assets, shares or other ownership interests, debt forgiveness, or services or other in-kind consideration.

      (b) Determining the value of consideration:

      (1) Where the consideration is or includes securities traded on a national securities exchange, the value of the securities is the closing price on the national securities exchange on which the securities are primarily traded on the trading day immediately prior to the date the parties file the formal written notice with the Committee under § 800.501(a), or if the securities were not traded on that day, the last published closing price.

      (2) Where the consideration is or includes other non-cash assets, services, interests, or other in-kind consideration, the value of the assets, services, interests, or other in-kind consideration is their fair market value as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (3) Where the transaction is or includes a lending transaction, the consideration includes the cash value of the loan, or similar financing arrangement, made available or provided by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a party to the transaction.

      (4) Where the transaction is or includes the conversion of a contingent equity interest previously acquired by a foreign person that is a party to the transaction, the consideration includes what was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to initially acquire the contingent equity interest, in addition to any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

      (c) Exceptions:

      (1) To the extent the consideration to be provided by the foreign person has not been or cannot reasonably be determined as of the date the parties file the notice, the value of the transaction includes, with respect to the interest for which consideration has not been determined, the fair market value of the interest being acquired in the transaction as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (2) Where the transaction involves a merger or the contribution of one or more U.S. businesses to a joint venture, the value of the transaction is the fair market value of the U.S. business(es) being merged or contributed.

      (3) Where the value of a transaction is $5,000,000 or more, but the transaction includes one or more non-U.S. businesses, and the value of the interest acquired in the U.S. business is less than $5,000,000, the filing fee under § 800.1101(b) is applicable. The value of the U.S. business, for purposes of this paragraph, is the fair market value of the assets of the U.S. business.

      (d) Fair market value means the price that would be received in exchange for sale of an interest, or paid to receive a service or to transfer liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants.

      (1) In determining fair market value, parties shall make a good faith estimate and generally may rely on the last valuation as presented in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other widely recognized accounting principles, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards, or the valuation of an independent appraiser; provided, however, that if no valuation has occurred within the prior two fiscal quarters, or if there have been significant changes to the fair market value since the last valuation, the parties shall make a good faith estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice, or, if the parties are filing after the completion of the transaction, the completion date of the transaction.

      (2) In determining the fair market value of services, the parties may rely upon the value of services determined by the parties as set forth in an executed written agreement, or make an estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice based upon rates charged to third parties or upon recent industry reports or other sources of comparable commercial data; provided, however, if such sources are unavailable, the parties shall make a good faith estimate. If the parties are filing after completion of the transaction, the parties shall make an estimate of the fair market value as of the completion date.

      (3) The Staff Chairperson is not bound by the parties' characterization of the transaction and its value or the parties' good faith approximation provided to the Committee under § 800.502(c)(1)(viii).

      (e) Multiple-phase and contingent equity interest transactions:

      (1) Where a transaction will be effectuated in multiple phases, the value of the transaction includes the total value of the multiple phases, as may be reasonably determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (2) Where a transaction is or includes the acquisition of contingent equity interest, the value of the transaction includes the consideration that was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to acquire the contingent equity interest, and, if the conditions that lead to conversion will occur imminently, the conditions are within the control of the acquiring party, and the consideration for the interest that would be acquired upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions can be reasonably determined at the time of acquisition, any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

      (f) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, in exchange for $100,000,000 in cash. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $100,000,000, and the filing fee is $75,000.

      (2)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, in a two-for-one stock swap transaction whereby a holder of a share of Corporation B's stock is entitled to receive two shares of Corporation A's stock. Corporation A's stock is listed on the NASDAQ, a national securities exchange. In aggregate, the holders of Corporation B's stock will receive 10,000,000 shares of Corporation A's stock in the transaction. On the trading day immediately prior to the filing of the formal written notice, the closing price of Corporation A's stock on NASDAQ was $20 per share. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $200,000,000, and the filing fee is $75,000.

      (3)  Corporation B, a U.S. business, is issuing new shares that will represent 50 percent of its issued and outstanding shares. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to acquire these shares. As consideration, Corporation A will contribute to Corporation B certain inventory, machines, and intellectual property. The parties to the transaction estimate in good faith, based on the most recent quarterly financial statements of Corporation A, which were prepared in accordance with GAAP, that the fair market value of the assets contributed as consideration is $40,000,000. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $40,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.

      (4)  Corporation A and Corporation B are establishing a joint venture, JV Corp., which will be controlled by Corporation B, a foreign person. Corporation A contributes a U.S. business, the fair market value of which is $150,000,000, to JV Corp. Corporation B contributes $150,000,000 in cash to JV Corp. The value of the transaction is $150,000,000, which is equal to the value of the U.S. business being contributed. Assuming no other relevant facts, the filing fee is $75,000.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person, enters into a stock purchase agreement with Person Z to acquire 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. The value of the consideration has not been determined because it will be payable only once Corporation B achieves certain development and sales milestones, and it will be 10 percent of Corporation B's revenue over a future five-year period. The parties estimate in good faith that the fair market value of 100 percent of the shares of Corporation B is $30,000,000 based on a number of factors, including application of well-known accounting standards such as Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 157, a recent valuation conducted by a third-party auditor, and a proposal to acquire Corporation B made by another bidder for approximately $30,000,000 in cash. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $30,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to acquire 100 percent of the assets of Corporation B, a foreign person, for $100,000,000. Corporation B has subsidiaries in several countries, including Corporation C, a U.S. business. The fair market value of Corporation C's assets is $1,000,000. Assuming no other relevant facts, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a $750 filing fee is required.

      (7)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to acquire 50 percent of the voting interest of Corporation B, a U.S. business. Under the terms of a stock purchase agreement, the transaction will be effectuated in two phases. First, Corporation A will acquire 25 percent of the voting interest of Corporation B in exchange for $30,000,000 (phase 1). Two months later, Corporation A will acquire the other 25 percent of the voting interest of Corporation B in exchange for another $30,000,000 (phase 2). Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the consideration is $60,000,000 (the total consideration for both phases), and the filing fee is $75,000.

      (8)  Corporation A, a foreign person, pays $5,000,000 to acquire 100,000 shares and call options from Corporation B, a U.S. business. The call options can be exercised after 90 days, and if exercised, Corporation A will have the right to acquire another 60,000 shares of Corporation B in exchange for an additional $3,000,000. Because the options may be exercised imminently, conversion of the call options is in the control of Corporation A, and the consideration for the interest acquired as a result of conversion can be reasonably determined, the value of the transaction includes the consideration for the shares and the call options as well as the consideration paid to exercise the options. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the consideration is $8,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.

      (g) The determination of the value of the transaction for purposes of calculating the filing fee in no way limits the Committee's jurisdiction or its authority to review, investigate, mitigate, impose penalties regarding, or take any other action regarding any covered transaction.

      § 800.1104   Manner of payment.

#### § § 800.1104

      Parties to a transaction must pay any filing fee by electronic payment. The filing fee must be paid in U.S. dollars. Instructions for paying filing fees are available on the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website.

      § 800.1105   Refunds.

#### § § 800.1105

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Department of the Treasury shall not refund a filing fee in whole or in part.

      (b) If the Committee determines that the transaction is not a covered transaction, the filing fee shall be refunded.

      (c) In response to a petition by a party, if the Staff Chairperson determines, based on the information and representations contained in the formal written notice, as well as any other information provided by the parties, that a party or the parties to a transaction paid a filing fee in an amount greater than required at the time of filing, the Department of the Treasury shall refund the amount of overpayment to the party or parties who paid the filing fee.

      § 800.1106   Waiver.

#### § § 800.1106

      If the Staff Chairperson determines that extraordinary circumstances relating to national security warrant, the Staff Chairperson may waive the filing fee in whole or in part and will notify the parties in writing. No waiver shall be implied, even where the Staff Chairperson does not reject a voluntary notice under § 800.1108 for failure to pay the required filing fee.

      § 800.1107   Refilings.

#### § § 800.1107

      The parties to a transaction shall not be required to pay an additional filing fee in the event that the Staff Chairperson permits the parties to withdraw and refile a notice under § 800.509(c)(2), unless the Staff Chairperson determines that a material change to the transaction has occurred, or a material inaccuracy or omission was made by the parties in information provided to the Committee, that requires the Committee to consider new information, in which case the Staff Chairperson will inform the parties in writing.

      § 800.1108   Rejection of voluntary notice.

#### § § 800.1108

      The Staff Chairperson may reject a voluntary notice under § 800.504(a)(3) upon a determination that the amount of the filing fee paid by the parties was insufficient under this subpart. Prior to rejecting a notice under § 800.504(a)(3), the Staff Chairperson shall inform the parties in writing of the insufficiency of payment and provide the parties three business days to pay the remainder of the filing fee. If the Staff Chairperson does not reject a voluntary notice under § 800.504(a)(3) upon a determination that the amount of the filing fee payment paid by the parties was insufficient under this section, the balance of the fee remains payable unless the Staff Chairperson notifies the parties in writing that the payment has been waived in whole or in part.

The pilot program also requires that parties to a pilot program covered transaction notify CFIUS of the transaction by either submitting a declaration or filing a written notice. The regulations in this part supplement the existing regulations implementing section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, under part 800 to Title 31 CFR Chapter VIII, which remain in effect. The pilot program implemented through these regulations will end no later than the date on which the full regulations implementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 become effective, and in no event later than the date that is 570 days after the enactment of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018.

Any such risk-based analysis shall include credible evidence demonstrating the risk and an assessment of the threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences to national security related to the transaction. For purposes of this part, any such analysis of risk shall include and be informed by consideration of the following elements:

      (a) The  which is a function of the intent and capability of a foreign person to take action to impair the national security of the United States;

      (b) The  which are the extent to which the nature of the covered real estate presents susceptibility to impairment of national security; and

      (c) The  which are the potential effects on national security that could reasonably result from the exploitation of the vulnerabilities by the threat actor.

      § 802.216   Excepted real estate transaction.

#### § § 802.216

      The term  means the following:

      (a) A purchase or lease by, or concession to, an excepted real estate investor of covered real estate, or a change in rights of an excepted real estate investor with respect to covered real estate.

      (b) A covered transaction as defined in part 800 of this chapter that includes the purchase, lease, or concession of covered real estate.

      (c) The purchase, lease, or concession of covered real estate that is within an urbanized area or urban cluster, except for real estate that is subject to paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of § 802.211.

      (d) The purchase, lease, or concession of covered real estate that is a single housing unit, including fixtures and adjacent land to the extent that such fixtures and land are incidental to the use of the real estate as a single housing unit.

      (e) The lease by or a concession to a foreign person of covered real estate under paragraph (a) of § 802.211 if:

      (1) The foreign person is a foreign air carrier, as that term is defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(21), for whom the Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration has accepted a security program under 49 CFR 1546.105, but only to the extent that the lease or concession is in furtherance of its activities as a foreign air carrier; or

      (2) According to the terms of the lease or concession, the covered real estate may be used only for the purpose of engaging in the retail sale of consumer goods or services to the public.

      (f) The purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person of commercial space in a multi-unit building that is covered real estate, if, upon the completion of the transaction:

      (1) The foreign person and its affiliates do not, in the aggregate, hold, lease, or have a concession with respect to commercial space in such building that exceeds 10 percent of the total square footage of the commercial space of such building; and

      (2) The foreign person and its affiliates (each counted separately) do not represent more than 10 percent of the total number of tenants based on the number of ownership, lease and concession arrangements for commercial space in the building.

      (g) The purchase or lease by, or a concession to, a foreign person of covered real estate either:

      (1) Owned by an Alaska “Native village,” “Native group,” or “Native Corporation” as those terms are defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 43 U.S.C. 1602; or

      (2) Held in trust by the United States for American Indians, Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, or any of the entities set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

      (h) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation X is in the business of owning and leasing real estate, including real estate properties that are in close proximity to military installations identified in part 1 and part 2 of appendix A to this part. As the sole owner of Corporation X, Corporation A will have control over Corporation X. The proposed transaction is not a covered real estate transaction but is a covered transaction under part 800 of this chapter.

      (2)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. After the transaction contemplated in Example 1 of this section is completed, Corporation X leases from another person a tract of land that is in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is a covered real estate transaction but only with respect to the new lease.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, seeks to purchase from Corporation X an empty warehouse located in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 2 of appendix A to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, the purchase of the covered real estate is not a covered transaction subject to part 800 of this chapter because Corporation A has not acquired a U.S. business, and the purchase is a covered real estate transaction.

      (4)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, except that, in addition to the proposed purchase of Corporation X's empty warehouse, Corporation A would also acquire from Corporation X the personnel, customer list, equipment, and inventory management software used to operate the warehouse. Under these facts, Corporation A is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed transaction is a covered transaction subject to part 800 of this chapter and therefore not a covered real estate transaction.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases covered real estate that is undeveloped and in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part. Corporation A, through a newly incorporated U.S. subsidiary, intends to use the covered real estate to set up a manufacturing facility. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A has not acquired a U.S. business, the purchase of the covered real estate is not a covered transaction subject to part 800 of this chapter, and Corporation A's purchase of the covered real estate is a covered real estate transaction.

      (6)  A foreign person purchases real estate. The nearest military installation is one that is identified in part 2 of appendix A to this part and is 40 miles away ( in the extended range) from the real estate. The real estate is located in a statistical geographic area with a population of 125,000 individuals. Assuming no other relevant facts, the transaction is not a covered real estate transaction because the covered real estate is located in an urbanized area.

      (7)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, except that the covered real estate is not located in an urbanized area or an urban cluster. Assuming no other relevant facts, the real estate transaction is a covered real estate transaction.

      (8)  A foreign person purchases real estate that is 0.25 miles from a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part. The real estate is located in an urbanized area. Assuming no other relevant facts, the real estate transaction is a covered real estate transaction because it is in close proximity to a military installation listed in part 1 of appendix A to this part.

      (9)  A foreign person purchases a single housing unit, including the one acre of land surrounding it, within 0.5 miles from a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part. Each home in the neighborhood sits on a separate lot, each of which is approximately one acre in size. The acre of land surrounding the housing unit is incidental to use of the land as a single housing unit, and the real estate transaction therefore is not a covered real estate transaction.

      (10)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (h)(9) of this section, except that the foreign person also purchases an adjacent five acres of undeveloped land a year later. Assuming no other relevant facts, the purchase of the adjacent land is a covered real estate transaction.

      (11)  A foreign person leases five percent of the total commercial space in a building located 0.5 miles from a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part. There are nine other tenants that have leases for commercial space with the building owner. Assuming no other relevant facts, the transaction is a not a covered real estate transaction.

      § 802.217   Extended range.

#### § § 802.217

      The term  means, with respect to any military installation identified in § 802.227(h), (k), or (m), as listed in part 2 of appendix A to this part, the area that extends 99 miles outward from the outer boundary of close proximity to such military installation, but, where applicable, not exceeding the outer limit of the territorial sea of the United States.

      § 802.218   Foreign entity.

#### § § 802.218

      (a) The term  means any branch, partnership, group or sub-group, association, estate, trust, corporation or division of a corporation, or organization organized under the laws of a foreign state if either its principal place of business is outside the United States or its equity securities are primarily traded on one or more foreign exchanges.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any branch, partnership, group or sub-group, association, estate, trust, corporation or division of a corporation, or organization that can demonstrate that a majority of the equity interest in such entity is ultimately owned by U.S. nationals is not a foreign entity.

      § 802.219   Foreign government.

#### § § 802.219

      The term  means any government or body exercising governmental functions, other than the U.S. Government or a subnational government of the United States. The term includes, but is not limited to, national and subnational governments, including their respective departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.

      § 802.220   Foreign national.

#### § § 802.220

      The term  means any individual other than a U.S. national.

      § 802.221   Foreign person.

#### § § 802.221

      (a) The term  means:

      (1) Any foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity; or

      (2) Any entity over which control is exercised or exercisable by a foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity.

      (b) Any entity over which control is exercised or exercisable by a foreign person is a foreign person.

      (c) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is engaged in business only outside the United States. All of its shares are held by Corporation X, which solely controls Corporation A. Corporation X is organized in the United States and is wholly owned and controlled by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A, although organized and operating only outside the United States, is not a foreign entity due to § 802.218(b) and is not a foreign person.

      (2)  Same facts as the first sentence of the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The government of the foreign state under whose laws Corporation A is organized exercises control over Corporation A because a law establishing Corporation A gives the foreign state the right to appoint Corporation A's board members. Corporation A is a foreign person.

      (3)  Corporation A is organized in the United States, is engaged in interstate commerce in the United States, and is controlled by Corporation X. Corporation X is organized under the laws of a foreign state, its principal place of business is located outside the United States, and 50 percent of its shares are held by foreign nationals and 50 percent of its shares are held by U.S. nationals. Both Corporation A and Corporation X are foreign persons. Corporation A is also a U.S. business.

      (4)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and is owned and controlled by a foreign national. A branch of Corporation A engages in interstate commerce in the United States. Corporation A (including its branch) is a foreign person. The branch is also a U.S. business.

      (5)  Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign state and its principal place of business is located outside the United States. Forty-five percent of the equity interest in Corporation A is owned in equal shares by numerous unrelated foreign investors, none of whom has control. The foreign investors have no formal or informal arrangement with any other holder of equity interest in Corporation A to act in concert regarding Corporation A. Corporation A can demonstrate that the remainder of the equity interest in Corporation A is ultimately held by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a foreign entity or foreign person.

      (6)  Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, except that one of the foreign investors, a foreign national, controls Corporation A. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a foreign entity due to § 802.218(b), but it is a foreign person under paragraph (a)(2) of this section because it is controlled by a foreign national.

The road will remain owned by the neighbor following the arrangement. The neighbor will also retain physical possession of his land despite the foreign person having permission to traverse the land while using the road. The arrangement does not convey a possessory interest in real estate. Assuming no other relevant facts, the foreign person has not entered into a lease.

    Subpart C—Coverage

      § 802.301   Transactions that are covered real estate transactions.

#### § § 802.301

      Transactions that are covered real estate transactions include:

      (a) A transaction that meets the criteria of § 802.212, including where a foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) enters into a purchase or lease of, or obtains a concession to, covered real estate either directly or indirectly. (See the examples in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.)

      (b) A purchase by a foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) of less than full ownership of covered real estate that nevertheless affords the foreign person at least three property rights with respect to the covered real estate. (See the example in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.)

      (c) A purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) of real estate, a portion of which is covered real estate with respect to which the foreign person has at least three property rights. (See the example in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.)

      (d) A purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) of a portion of covered real estate with respect to which the foreign person has at least three property rights. (See the example in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.)

      (e) A purchase, lease, or assignment of a concession, of covered real estate that meets the criteria of § 802.212 by one foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) from another foreign person. (See the example in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.)

      (f) A purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person (other than an excepted real estate investor) of covered real estate, that, through a subsequent change in the rights that a foreign person has with respect to covered real estate, results in the foreign person having at least three property rights. (See the example in paragraph (h)(7) of this section.)

      (g) A transaction the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent the application of this part.

      (h) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires Corporation X, a U.S. business. As a result, Corporation X is a foreign person. Subsequently, Corporation X purchases real estate that is in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part and obtains all of the property rights with respect to such real estate. Assuming no other relevant facts, the transaction is a covered real estate transaction.

      (2)  Corporation A purchases covered real estate that is undeveloped land. Corporation A's only asset in the United States is the covered real estate, and Corporation A is not itself nor does it own a U.S. business. In a subsequent transaction, Corporation B, a foreign person, purchases 100 percent of the shares of Corporation A. Assuming no other relevant facts, the subsequent transaction as an indirect purchase of real estate is a covered real estate transaction.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, together with Corporation B, a U.S. business, purchases real estate that is in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 2 of appendix A to this part. Neither party has full ownership; rather, the title to the real estate is held by the two parties jointly. Corporation A is afforded at least three property rights as a result of the transaction. Assuming no other relevant facts, the transaction is a covered real estate transaction.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases real estate. Half of such real estate is located in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 1 of appendix A to this part of and is therefore covered real estate. The other half of the real estate purchased by Corporation A is not located in close proximity to any such military installation. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A's purchase is a covered real estate transaction.

      (5)  Corporation A, a U.S. business, purchases covered real estate that is entirely located in close proximity to a military installation identified in part 2 of appendix A to this part. Corporation B, a foreign person, leases from Corporation A a part of that real estate. Corporation B is entitled to at least three property rights with respect to the real estate as a result of the transaction. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation B's lease is a covered real estate transaction.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases covered real estate and is afforded three property rights with respect to the covered real estate. In a subsequent transaction, Corporation B, another foreign person, leases the covered real estate from Corporation A, and is also afforded three property rights. Assuming no other relevant facts, each transaction is a covered real estate transaction.

      (7)  Corporation A, a foreign person, leases from Person B covered real estate, and is afforded two property rights. Person B subsequently provides Corporation A an additional property right in connection with the lease. Assuming no other relevant facts, the lease is a covered real estate transaction because the subsequent change in rights results in the foreign person having at least three property rights.

      § 802.302   Transactions that are not covered real estate transactions.

#### § § 802.302

      Transactions that are not covered real estate transactions include:

      (a) A transaction that meets the definition of excepted real estate transaction in § 802.216.

      (b) A purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person of covered real estate, or a subsequent change in rights, that does not afford or result in the foreign person having at least three of the property rights with respect to the covered real estate.

      (c) An acquisition of securities by a person acting as a securities underwriter, in the ordinary course of business and in the process of underwriting.

      (d) An acquisition pursuant to a condition in a contract of insurance relating to fidelity, surety, or casualty obligations if the contract was made by an insurer in the ordinary course of business.

      § 802.303   Lending transactions.

#### § § 802.303

      (a) The extension of a mortgage, loan, or similar financing arrangement by a foreign person to another person for the purpose of the purchase, lease, or concession of covered real estate, regardless of whether accompanied by the creation in favor of the foreign person of a secured interest in the covered real estate, shall not, by itself, constitute a covered real estate transaction.

      (1) The Committee will accept notices or declarations concerning a mortgage, loan, or similar financing arrangement that does not, by itself, constitute a covered real estate transaction only at the time that, because of imminent or actual default or other condition, there is a significant possibility that a purchase or lease by, concession to, or a change in rights involving a foreign person may result from the default or other condition and that would constitute a covered real estate transaction.

      (2) Where the Committee accepts a notice or declaration concerning a mortgage, loan, or similar financing arrangement under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and a party to the transaction is a foreign person that makes mortgages or loans in the ordinary course of business, the Committee will take into account whether the foreign person has made any arrangements to transfer the ownership and property rights over the covered real estate to U.S. nationals or excepted real estate investors for purposes of determining whether such mortgage, loan, or financing arrangement constitutes a covered real estate transaction.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a mortgage, loan, or similar financing arrangement through which a foreign person acquires property rights over covered real estate may constitute a covered real estate transaction to the extent that the arrangement would constitute a purchase, lease, or concession under this part.

      (c) Example: Corporation A, a foreign bank, makes a secured loan to Corporation B in order for Corporation B to purchase a building that constitutes covered real estate. The collateral for the loan is the building that Corporation B is purchasing, and upon default, Corporation A would obtain an ownership interest and be afforded at least three property rights with respect to the building. Corporation B defaults on the loan. Assuming no other relevant facts, the Committee would accept a notice or declaration of the imminent default or default transferring ownership of the building to Corporation A, which would constitute a covered real estate transaction.

      § 802.304   Timing rule for a contingent equity interest.

#### § § 802.304

      (a) For purposes of determining whether to include the rights that a holder of a contingent equity interest will acquire upon conversion of, or exercise of a right provided by, that interest in the Committee's analysis of whether a notified transaction is a covered real estate transaction, the Committee will consider factors that include:

      (1) The imminence of conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions;

      (2) Whether conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions depends on factors within the control of the acquiring party; and

      (3) Whether the amount of interest and the rights that would be acquired upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions can be reasonably determined at the time of acquisition.

      (b) When the Committee, applying paragraph (a) of this section, determines that the rights that the holder will acquire upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent condition will not be included in the Committee's analysis of whether a notified or submitted transaction is a covered real estate transaction, the Committee will disregard the contingent equity interest for purposes of that transaction except to the extent that they convey immediate rights to the holder with respect to the entity that issued the interest.

      § 802.504   Deferral, rejection, or disposition of certain voluntary notices.

#### § § 802.504

      (a) The Committee, acting through the Staff Chairperson, may:

      (1) Reject any voluntary notice that does not comply with § 802.501 or § 802.502 and so inform the parties promptly in writing;

      (i) There is a material change in the transaction as to which notification has been made; or

      (ii) Information comes to light that contradicts material information provided in the notice by the parties;

      (3) Reject any voluntary notice at any time upon determining that the filing fee paid by the parties was insufficient under subpart K of this part, subject to § 802.1108;

      (4) Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the party or parties that have submitted the voluntary notice do not provide follow-up information requested by the Staff Chairperson within three business days of the request, or within a longer time frame if the parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that request in writing;

      (5) Reject any voluntary notice before the conclusion of a review or investigation, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if one of the parties submitting the voluntary notice has not submitted the final certification required by § 802.502(l); or

      (6) Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the Committee has proposed risk mitigation terms, including revisions to such terms, and if the Staff Chairperson has imposed a time frame for responding to such terms as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, to the party or parties that submitted the notice and the party or parties have failed to substantively respond to such terms within the time frame specified.

      (b) Notwithstanding the authority of the Staff Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section to reject an incomplete notice, the Staff Chairperson may defer acceptance of the notice, and the beginning of the review period specified by § 802.503, to obtain any information required under this section that has not been submitted by the notifying party or parties or other parties to the transaction. Where necessary to obtain such information, the Staff Chairperson may inform any non-notifying party or parties that notice has been filed with respect to a transaction involving the party, and request that certain information required under this section, as specified by the Staff Chairperson, be provided to the Committee within seven days after receipt of the Staff Chairperson's request.

      (c) The Staff Chairperson shall notify the parties when the Committee has found that the transaction that is the subject of a voluntary notice is not a covered real estate transaction.

The time frame may be extended if the parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that request in writing. In determining whether to impose such a time frame, the Staff Chairperson may consider:

      (1) The statutory deadline for completing an investigation under section 721(b)(2)(C)(i);

      (2) The risk to the national security of the United States arising from the transaction;

      (3) The party's or parties' responsiveness to the Committee;

The joint notice does not contain any information described under § 802.502 concerning the nature of the real estate. The Staff Chairperson may reject the notice or defer the start of the review period until the parties have supplied the omitted information.

      (2) The lead agency recommends, and the Committee concurs, that an investigation be undertaken.

      (b) The Committee shall also undertake, after a review of a covered real estate transaction under § 802.503, an investigation to determine the effects on national security of any covered real estate transaction that would result in control by a foreign person of critical infrastructure, as defined in § 800.214 of this title, of or within the United States, if the Committee determines that the transaction could impair the national security and such impairment has not been mitigated.

      (c) The Committee shall undertake an investigation as described in paragraph (b) of this section unless the Chairperson of the Committee (or the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury) and the head of any lead agency (or his or her delegee at the deputy level or equivalent) designated by the Chairperson determine on the basis of the review that the covered real estate transaction will not impair the national security of the United States.

      § 802.1103   Valuation.

#### § § 802.1103

      Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the value of the transaction for purposes of determining the required fee amount in this subpart shall be determined as follows:

      (a) For a transaction structured as a purchase, by the total value of all consideration that has been or will be provided in the context of the transaction by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a purchaser in the transaction, including cash, assets, shares or other ownership interests, debt forgiveness, or services or other in-kind consideration.

      (b) For a transaction structured as a lease, by the value of the sum of, as applicable:

      (1) Any fixed payments to be paid by the foreign person that is a lessee in the transaction to, or for the benefit of, the lessor over the term of the lease;

      (2) Any variable payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as a market interest rate) to be paid by the foreign person that is a lessee in the transaction to, or for the benefit of, the lessor, over the term of the lease, measured for purposes of this section by using the index or rate on the day immediately prior to the date the parties file the formal written notice; and

      (3) Any non-cash consideration to be provided by the foreign person that is a lessee in the transaction to, or for the benefit of, the lessor, over the term of the lease, as may be reasonably determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (c) For a transaction structured as a concession, by the value of the sum of all rent, fees, and charges to be paid by the foreign person to the grantor and any non-cash consideration to be provided by such foreign person to, or for the benefit of, the grantor, over the term of a concession agreement, as may be reasonably determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (d) Determining the value of consideration:

      (1) Where the consideration is or includes securities traded on a national securities exchange, the value of the securities is the closing price on the national securities exchange on which the securities are primarily traded on the trading day immediately prior to the date the parties file the formal written notice with the Committee under § 802.501(a), or if the securities were not traded on that day, the last published closing price.

      (2) Where the consideration is or includes other non-cash assets, services, interests, or other in-kind consideration, including real property contributed by a foreign person that is party to a transaction involving the exchange of land or contribution to a joint venture, the value of the assets, service, interests, or other in-kind consideration is their fair market value as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (3) Where the transaction is or includes a lending transaction, the consideration includes the cash value of the mortgage, loan, or similar financing arrangement, made available or provided by or on behalf of the foreign person that is a party to the transaction.

      (4) Where the transaction is or includes the conversion of a contingent equity interest previously acquired by a foreign person that is a party to the transaction, the consideration includes what was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to initially acquire the contingent equity interest, in addition to any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

      (e) Exceptions:

      (1) In the case of a purchase, to the extent the consideration to be provided by the foreign person has not been or cannot reasonably be determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice, the value of the transaction includes, with respect to assets for which consideration has not been determined, the fair market value of the assets being purchased in the transaction as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (2) In the case of a lease or concession, where the consideration to be provided by the foreign person has not been or cannot reasonably be determined at the time of filing, or, where the parties cannot reasonably determine the value of rent, fees, charges, or services under paragraph (c) of this section, the filing fee required shall be that required under § 802.1101(b).

      (f) The Staff Chairperson is not bound by the parties' characterization of the transaction and its value or their good faith approximation provided to the Committee under § 802.502(b)(1)(ix).

      (g) Fair market value means the price that would be received in exchange for sale of an interest, or paid to receive a service or to transfer liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants.

      (1) In determining fair market value, parties shall make a good faith estimate and generally may rely on the last valuation as presented in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or other widely recognized accounting principles, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards, or the valuation of an independent appraiser; provided, however, that if no valuation has occurred within the prior two fiscal quarters, or if there have been significant changes to the fair market value since the last valuation, the parties shall make a good faith estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice, or, if the parties are filing after the completion of the transaction, the completion date of the transaction.

      (2) In determining the fair market value of services, the parties may rely upon the value of services determined by the parties as set forth in an executed written agreement, or make an estimate at the time of filing the formal written notice based upon rates charged to third parties or recent industry reports or other sources of comparable commercial data; provided, however, if such sources are unavailable, the parties shall make a good faith estimate. If the parties are filing after completion of the transaction, the parties shall make an estimate of the fair market value as of the completion date.

      (h) Multiple-phase and contingent equity interest transactions:

      (1) Where a transaction will be effectuated in multiple phases, the value of the transaction includes the total value of the multiple phases, as may be reasonably determined as of the date the parties file the formal written notice.

      (2) Where a transaction is or includes the acquisition of contingent equity interest, the value of the transaction includes the consideration that was paid by or on behalf of the foreign person to acquire the contingent equity interest, and, if the conditions that lead to conversion will occur imminently, the conditions are within the control of the acquiring party, and the consideration for the interest that would be acquired upon conversion or satisfaction of contingent conditions can be reasonably determined at the time of acquisition, any other consideration paid or to be paid in connection with the conversion.

      (i) Examples:

      (1)  Corporation A, a foreign person, enters into an agreement for the purchase of a parcel of covered real estate (Parcel X) from Corporation B. In exchange for ownership of Parcel X, Corporation A forgives a debt owed to it by Corporation B that is valued at $5,000,000 and pays $35,000,000 to Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $40,000,000, and the filing fee is $7,500.

      (2)  Corporation A, a foreign person, enters into an agreement to lease a parcel of covered real estate from Corporation B. Pursuant to the agreement, Corporation A will pay Corporation B a fixed annual payment of $300,000 for a term of three years, with an option to renew the lease at the end of the term. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $900,000, and the filing fee is $750.

      (3)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to enter into a concession agreement with a U.S. public entity for the right to use certain covered real estate for the purpose of developing and operating terminal infrastructure at a covered port. The concession agreement is for a five-year term. Under the concession agreement, Corporation A will pay the U.S. public entity a use charge of $450,000 per year starting in the second year. The concession agreement also requires Corporation A to pay utility fees and common area maintenance charges of $5,000 per month for the full concession term. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $2,100,000, based on the $1,800,000 use charge and $300,000 in utility fees. The filing fee is $750.

      (4)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to enter into an oil, gas and mineral lease with a U.S. public entity. Under the terms of the lease, Corporation A pays a lease bonus of $1,000 per acre as an inducement to execute the lease with respect to a 10-acre parcel of covered real estate. The lease has a 10-year term. Corporation A must pay a royalty of 12.5 percent with respect to oil or gas production from the leased parcel. In the absence of such production, the foreign person is obligated to pay a rental fee of $1,000 per acre per year for the first five years and $2,000 per acre thereafter. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the transaction is $160,000 and there is no filing fee.

      (5)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase Plot X and Plot Y. The transaction will be completed in two phases. Corporation A will first acquire Plot X for $30,000,000 (phase 1). One month later, Corporation A will acquire Plot Y for another $30,000,000 (phase 2). Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the consideration is $60,000,000 (the total consideration for both phases), and the filing fee is $75,000.

      (6)  Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase Plot X and acquire an option to purchase Plot Y. Corporation A will acquire Plot X and the option related to Plot Y in exchange for $30,000,000. Corporation A informs its shareholders that within two months, it will exercise the option to purchase Plot Y in exchange for another $30,000,000. Because the option to convert is imminent and in the control of Corporation A, and the consideration can be reasonably determined, the value of the transaction includes the consideration to be paid in connection with the conversion. Assuming no other relevant facts, the value of the consideration is $60,000,000 (the total consideration for the purchase of Plot X and the option to purchase Plot Y), and the filing fee is $75,000.

      (j) The determination of the value of the transaction for purposes of calculating the filing fee in no way limits the Committee's jurisdiction or its authority to review, investigate, mitigate, impose penalties regarding, or take any other action regarding any covered real estate transaction.

      § 802.1104   Manner of payment.

#### § § 802.1104

      Parties to a transaction must pay any filing fee by electronic payment. The filing fee must be paid in U.S. dollars. Instructions for paying filing fees are available on the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website.

      § 802.1105   Refunds.

#### § § 802.1105

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Department of the Treasury shall not refund a filing fee in whole or in part.

      (b) If the Committee determines that the transaction is not a covered real estate transaction, the filing fee shall be refunded.

      (c) In response to a petition by a party, if the Staff Chairperson determines, based on the information and representations contained in the formal written notice, as well as any other information provided by the parties, that a party or the parties to a transaction paid a filing fee in an amount greater than required at the time of filing, the Department of the Treasury shall refund the amount of overpayment to the party or parties who paid the filing fee.

      § 802.1106   Waiver.

#### § § 802.1106

      If the Staff Chairperson determines that extraordinary circumstances relating to national security warrant, the Staff Chairperson may waive the filing fee in whole or in part and will notify the parties in writing. No waiver shall be implied, even where the Staff Chairperson does not reject a voluntary notice under § 802.1108 for failure to pay the required filing fee.

      § 802.1107   Refilings.

#### § § 802.1107

      The parties to a transaction shall not be required to pay an additional filing fee in the event that the Staff Chairperson permits the parties to withdraw and refile a notice under § 802.509(c)(2), unless the Staff Chairperson determines that a material change to the transaction has occurred, or a material inaccuracy or omission was made by the parties in information provided to the Committee, that requires the Committee to consider new information, in which case the Staff Chairperson will inform the parties in writing.

      § 802.1108   Rejection of voluntary notice.

#### § § 802.1108

      The Staff Chairperson may reject a voluntary notice under § 802.504(a)(3) upon a determination that the amount of the filing fee paid by the parties was insufficient under this subpart. Prior to rejecting a notice under § 802.504(a)(3), the Staff Chairperson shall inform the parties in writing of the insufficiency of payment and provide the parties three business days to pay the remainder of the filing fee. If the Staff Chairperson does not reject a voluntary notice under § 802.504(a)(3) upon a determination that the amount of the filing fee payment paid by the parties was insufficient under this section, the balance of the fee remains payable unless the Staff Chairperson notifies the parties in writing that the payment has been waived in whole or in part.

      (b) Such assessment as to whether, at the time of a given transaction, a U.S. person has or had knowledge of a given fact or circumstance will be made based on information a U.S. person had or could have had through a reasonable and diligent inquiry.

      (2) The contractual representations or warranties the U.S. person has obtained or attempted to obtain from the investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) with respect to the determination of a transaction's status as a covered transaction and status of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) as a covered foreign person;

      (3) The efforts by the U.S. person as of the time of the transaction to obtain and consider available non-public information relevant to the determination of a transaction's status as a covered transaction and the status of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) as a covered foreign person;

      (4) Available public information, the efforts undertaken by the U.S. person to obtain and consider such information, and the degree to which other information available to the U.S. person as of the time of the transaction is consistent or inconsistent with such publicly available information;

      (5) Whether the U.S. person purposefully avoided learning or seeking relevant information;

      (6) The presence or absence of warning signs, which may include evasive responses or non-responses from an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) to questions or a refusal to provide information, contractual representations, or warranties; and

      (7) The use of available public and commercial databases to identify and verify relevant information of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner).

      (d) An assessment of whether a U.S. person has undertaken a reasonable and diligent inquiry shall be based on a consideration of the totality of relevant facts and circumstances.

    Subpart E—Exceptions and Exemptions

      § 850.501   Excepted transaction.

#### § § 850.501

      A transaction that would be either a prohibited transaction or a notifiable transaction if engaged in by a U.S. person but for this section is not a prohibited transaction or a notifiable transaction, as applicable, if the conditions set forth in this section are met. In that case, the transaction is an excepted transaction. The following transactions are excepted transactions:

      (a)(1) An investment by a U.S. person:

      (i) In any publicly traded security, with “security” as defined in section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10), denominated in any currency, and that trades on a securities exchange or through the method of trading that is commonly referred to as “over-the-counter,” in any jurisdiction;

      (ii) In a security issued by:

      (A) Any “investment company” as defined in section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1), that is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such as index funds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds; or

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an investment is not an excepted transaction if it affords the U.S. person rights beyond standard minority shareholder protections with respect to the covered foreign person. Such standard minority shareholder protections include:

      (i) The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially all of the assets of an entity or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or liquidation;

      (2) Following such acquisition, the entity does not constitute a covered foreign person;

      (c) A transaction that, but for this paragraph, would be a covered transaction between a U.S. person and its controlled foreign entity that supports operations that are not covered activities or that maintains covered activities that the controlled foreign entity was engaged in prior to January 2, 2025;

      (d) A transaction made after January 2, 2025, pursuant to a binding, uncalled capital commitment entered into before January 2, 2025;

      (1) Cannot on its own initiate any action vis-à-vis the debtor; and

      (2) Is not the syndication agent;

      (f) The receipt of employment compensation by an individual in the form of an award of equity or the grant of an option to purchase equity in a covered foreign person, or the exercise of such option; or

Any rescission shall be made available through public notice.

#### § § 850.502

      (a) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, and the heads of relevant agencies, as appropriate, may determine that a covered transaction is in the national interest of the United States and therefore is exempt from applicable provisions in subparts C and D of this part (excluding §§ 850.406, 850.603, and 850.604). Such a determination may be made following a request by a U.S. person on its own behalf or on behalf of its controlled foreign entity.

      (b) Any determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section will be based on a consideration of the totality of the relevant facts and circumstances and may be informed by, among other considerations, the transaction's effect on critical U.S. supply chain needs; domestic production needs in the United States for projected national defense requirements; United States' technological leadership globally in areas affecting U.S. national security; and impact on U.S. national security if the U.S. person is prohibited from undertaking the transaction.

      (c) A U.S. person seeking a national interest exemption shall submit relevant information to the Department of the Treasury regarding the transaction and shall articulate the basis for the request, including the U.S. person's analysis of the transaction's potential impact on the national interest of the United States and the certification referred to in § 850.203. Information and other documents submitted by the U.S. person to the Department of the Treasury under this section shall be deemed part of the national interest exemption request. The U.S. person shall follow the instructions posted on the Department of the Treasury's Outbound Investment Security Program website. No communications or submissions other than those described in this section shall constitute a request for a national interest exemption. The Department of the Treasury may request additional information that may include some or all of the information required under § 850.405.

      (d) A determination that a covered transaction is exempt under this section may be subject to binding conditions.

      (e) No determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section will be valid unless provided to the subject U.S. person in writing and signed by the Assistant Secretary or Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security.

      (a) Any person who has engaged in conduct that may constitute a violation of this part may submit a voluntary self-disclosure of that conduct to the Department of the Treasury.

      (b) In determining the appropriate response to any violation, the Department of the Treasury will consider the submission and the timeliness of any voluntary self-disclosure.

      (c) In assessing the timeliness of a voluntary self-disclosure, the Department of the Treasury will consider whether it has learned of the conduct prior to the voluntary self-disclosure.

A voluntary self-disclosure must include, or be followed within a reasonable period of time by, a report of sufficient detail to afford a complete understanding of the conduct that may constitute the violation. A person making a voluntary self-disclosure must respond in a timely manner to any follow-up inquiries by the Department of the Treasury.
