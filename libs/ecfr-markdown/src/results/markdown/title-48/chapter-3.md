### Part 301

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 40 U.S.C. 121(c)(2).

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 72151, Nov. 18, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart 301.1—Purpose, Authority, and Issuance

        301.101   Purpose.

#### § 301.101

        (a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) establishes uniform HHS acquisition policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

        (b)(1) The HHSAR contains HHS policies that govern the acquisition process or otherwise control acquisition relationships between HHS' contracting activities and contractors. The HHSAR contains—

        (i) Requirements of law;

        (ii) HHS-wide policies;

        (iii) Deviations from FAR requirements; and

        (iv) Policies that have a significant effect beyond the internal procedures of HHS or a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.

        (2) Relevant internal procedures, guidance, and information not meeting the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are issued by HHS in other announcements, internal procedures, guidance, or information.

        301.103   Authority.

#### § 301.103

        (b) The Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources (ASFR) prescribes the HHSAR under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 121(c)(2)), as delegated by the Secretary).

        (c) The HHSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as chapter 3 of title 48, Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation. It may be referenced as “48 CFR chapter 3.”

        301.106   Office of Management and Budget approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

#### § 301.106

        (a) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 ) imposes a requirement on Federal agencies to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting the same information from 10 or more members of the public.

        (b) The following OMB control numbers apply to the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this chapter:

      Subpart 301.2 [Reserved]

      Subpart 301.4—Deviations from the FAR

        301.401   Deviations.

#### § 301.401

        Contracting officers are not permitted to deviate from the FAR or HHSAR without seeking proper approval. With full acknowledgement of FAR 1.102(d) regarding innovative approaches, any deviation to FAR or the HHSAR requires approval by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE).

      Subpart 301.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities

        301.602   Contracting officers.

#### § 301.602

        301.602-3   Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

#### § 301.602-3

        (b)  (1) The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer. See FAR 1.602-1. Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.

        (2) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) is the official authorized to ratify an unauthorized commitment. No other re-delegations are authorized.

        (c)  (5) The HCA shall coordinate the request for ratification with the Office of General Counsel, General Law Division and submit a copy to the SPE.

        301.603   Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment of contracting officers.

#### § 301.603

        301.603-1   General.

#### § 301.603-1

        (a) The Agency head has delegated broad authority to the Chief Acquisition Officer, who in turn has further delegated this authority to the SPE. The SPE has further delegated specific acquisition authority to the Operating and Staff Division heads and the HCAs. The HCA (non-delegable) shall select, appoint, and terminate the appointment of contracting officers.

        (b) To ensure proper control of redelegated acquisition authorities, HCAs shall maintain a file containing successive delegations of HCA authority through the contracting officer level.

        311.7000   Defining electronic and information technology requirements.

#### § 311.7000

        The contracting officer shall ensure that requiring activities specify agency needs for electronic and information technology (EIT) supplies and services, and document market research, document EIT requirements, and identify the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. See FAR 11.002(f) and HHSAR subpart 339.2.

      Subpart 311.71—Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities.

        311.7100   Policy.

#### § 311.7100

        (a) It is HHS policy that all contractors comply with current and any future changes to 28 CFR part 36—Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities. For the purpose of this policy, accessibility is defined as both physical access to public accommodations and commercial facilities, and access to aids and services enabling individuals with sensory disabilities to fully participate in events in public accommodations and commercial facilities.

        (b) This policy applies to all contracts requiring contractors to conduct events in public accommodations and commercial facilities open to the public or involving HHS personnel, but not ad hoc meetings necessary or incidental to contract performance.

        311.7101   Responsibilities.

#### § 311.7101

        The contractor shall submit a plan assuring that any event held will meet or exceed the minimum accessibility standards set forth in 28 CFR part 36. A consolidated or master plan for contracts requiring numerous events in public accommodations and commercial facilities is acceptable.

        311.7102   Contract clause.

#### § 311.7102

        The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.211-1, Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities, in solicitations, contracts, and orders requiring the contractor to conduct events in accordance with 311.7100(b).

      Subpart 311.72—Conference Funding and Sponsorship

        311.7200   Policy.

#### § 311.7200

        HHS policy requires that all conferences the agency funds or sponsors shall: be consistent with HHS missions, objectives, and policies; represent an efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds; and withstand public scrutiny.

        311.7201   Funding and sponsorship.

#### § 311.7201

        Funding a conference through a HHS contract does not automatically imply HHS sponsorship, unless the conference is funded entirely by the agency. Also, HHS staff attendance or participation at a conference does not imply HHS conference sponsorship. Accordingly, for non-conference contracts funded entirely by HHS prior to a contractor claiming HHS sponsorship, the contractor must provide the contracting officer a written request for permission to designate HHS the conference sponsor. The OPDIV or STAFFDIV (operating division or staff division) head, or designee, shall approve such requests. The determination on what constitutes a “conference contract” or a “non-conference contract” shall be made by the contracting officer.

        311.7202   Contract clause.

#### § 311.7202

        To ensure that a contractor:

        (a) Properly requests approval to designate HHS the conference sponsor, where HHS is not the sole provider of conference funding; and

        (b) Includes an appropriate Federal funding disclosure and content disclaimer statement for conference materials, the contracting officer shall include the clause at 352.211-2, Conference Sponsorship Request and Conference Materials Disclaimer, in solicitations, contracts, and orders providing funding which partially or fully supports a conference.

      Subpart 311.73—Contractor Collection of Information

        311.7300   Policy.

#### § 311.7300

        In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), contractors shall not proceed with collecting information from surveys, questionnaires, or interviews until the COR obtains an Office of Management and Budget clearance and the contracting officer issues written approval to proceed. For any contract involving a requirement to collect or record information calling either for answers to identical questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal employees, or information from Federal employees which is outside the scope of their employment, for use by the Federal Government or disclosure to third parties, the contracting officer must comply with the PRA of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 ).

        311.7301   Contract clause.

#### § 311.7301

        The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.211-3, Paperwork Reduction Act, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require a contractor to collect the same information from 10 or more persons.

        315.204-5   Part IV—Representations and instructions.

#### § 315.204-5

        (c)  (1) The requiring activity shall develop technical evaluation factors and submit them to the contracting officer as part of the acquisition plan or other acquisition request documentation for inclusion in a solicitation. The requiring activity shall indicate the relative importance or weight of the evaluation factors based on the requirements of an individual acquisition.

        (2) Only a formal amendment to a solicitation can change the evaluation factors.

        315.208   Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

#### § 315.208

        (b) In addition to the provision in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors—Competitive Acquisition, if the head of the contracting activity (HCA) determines that biomedical or behavioral research and development (R&D) acquisitions are subject to conditions other than those specified in FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), the HCA may authorize for use in competitive solicitations for R&D, the provision at 352.215-70, Late Proposals and Revisions.

        (2) When the provision at 352.215-70 is included in the solicitation and if the HCA intends to consider a proposal or proposals received after the exact time specified for receipt, the contracting officer, with the assistance of cost or technical personnel as appropriate, shall determine in writing that the proposal(s) meets the requirements of the provision at 352.215-70.

      Subpart 315.3—Source Selection

        315.303-70   Policy.

#### § 315.303-70

        (a) If an operating division (OPDIV) is required by statute to use peer review for technical review of proposals, the requirements of those statutes, any implementing regulatory requirements, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and as applicable, any approved Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) deviation(s) from this subpart take precedence over the otherwise applicable requirements of this subpart.

The avoidance of organizational and personal conflicts of interest must be taken into consideration when making the decision to use non-Federal evaluators.

        (2) When a solicited proposal will be disclosed outside the Government to a contractor or a contractor employee for evaluation purposes, the following or similar conditions shall be part of the written agreement with the contractor prior to disclosure:

        The contractor agrees that it and its employees, as well as any subcontractors and their employees (in these conditions, “evaluator”) will use the data (trade secrets, business data, and technical data) contained in the proposal for evaluation purposes only. The foregoing requirement does not apply to data obtained from another source without restriction. Any notice or legend placed on the proposal by either HHS or the offeror shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract provided to the evaluator or made by the evaluator. Upon completion of the evaluation, the evaluator shall return to the Government the furnished copy of the proposal or abstract, and all copies thereof, to the HHS office which initially furnished the proposal for evaluation. The evaluator shall not contact the offeror concerning any aspects of a proposal's contents.

When field-pricing support is required, contracting officers shall make the request through the HCA.

      Subpart 315.6—Unsolicited Proposals

        315.605   Content of unsolicited proposals.

#### § 315.605

        (d)  To ensure against contacts between HHS personnel and prospective offerors that would exceed the limits of advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.604 and potentially result in an unfair advantage to an offeror, the prospective offeror of an unsolicited proposal must include the following warranty in any unsolicited proposal. Contracting officers receiving an unsolicited proposal without this warranty shall not process the proposal until the offeror is notified of the missing language and given an opportunity to submit a proper warranty. If no warranty is provided in a reasonable time, the contracting officer shall reject the unsolicited proposal, notify the offeror of the rejection, and document the actions in the file.

        This is to warrant that—

        (a) This proposal has not been prepared under Government supervision;

        (b) The methods and approaches stated in the proposal were developed by this offeror;

        (c) Any contact with HHS personnel has been within the limits of appropriate advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.604; and,

        (d) No prior commitments were received from HHS personnel regarding acceptance of this proposal.

        (This warranty shall be signed by a responsible management official of the proposing organization who is a person authorized to contractually obligate the organization.)

        315.606   Agency procedures.

#### § 315.606

        (a) The HCA is responsible for establishing procedures to comply with FAR 15.606(a).

        (b) The HCA or designee shall be the point of contact for coordinating the receipt and processing of unsolicited proposals.

        315.606-1   Receipt and initial review.

#### § 315.606-1

        (d) OPDIVs may consider an unsolicited proposal even though an organization initially submitted it as a grant application. However, OPDIVs shall not award contracts based on unsolicited proposals that have been rejected for grant awards due to lack of scientific merit.

        (a) The contracting officer shall review all acquisition request documentation to determine whether the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) are applicable. The Privacy Act requirements apply when a contract or order requires the contractor to design, develop, or operate any Privacy Act system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function. When applicable, the contracting officer shall include the two Privacy Act clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 24.104 in the solicitation and contract or order. In addition, the contracting officer shall include the two FAR Privacy Act clauses, and other pertinent information specified in this subpart, in any modification which results in the Privacy Act requirements becoming applicable to a contract or order.

        (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that the statement of work or performance work statement (SOW or PWS) specifies the system(s) of records or proposed system(s) of records to which the Privacy Act and the implementing regulations are applicable or may be applicable. The contracting officer shall send the contractor a copy of 45 CFR part 5b, which includes the rules of conduct and other Privacy Act requirements.

        (c) The contracting officer shall ensure that the contract SOW or PWS specifies for both the Privacy Act and the Federal Records Act the disposition to be made of the system(s) of records upon completion of contract performance. The contract SOW or PWS may require the contractor to destroy the records, remove personal identifiers, or turn the records over to the contracting officer. If there is a legitimate need for a contractor to keep copies of the records after completion of a contract, the contractor must take measures, as approved by the contracting officer, to keep the records confidential and protect the individuals' privacy.

        (d) For any acquisition subject to Privacy Act requirements, the requiring activity prior to award shall prepare and have published in the  a “system notice,” describing the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) intent to establish a new system of records on individuals, to make modifications to an existing system, or to disclose information in regard to an existing system. The requiring activity shall attach a copy of the system notice to the acquisition plan or other acquisition request documentation. If a system notice is not attached, the contracting officer shall inquire about its status and shall obtain a copy from the requiring activity for inclusion in the contract file. If a notice for the system of records has not been published in the  the contracting officer may proceed with the acquisition but shall not award the contract until the system notice is published and the contracting officer verifies its publication.

        324.104   Restrictions on Contractor Access to Government or Third Party Information.

#### § 324.104

        The contracting officer shall establish the restrictions that govern the contractor employees' access to Government or third party information in order to protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

        324.105   Contract clauses.

#### § 324.105

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.224-70, Privacy Act, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require the design, development, or operation of a system of records to notify the contractor that it and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as HHS employees. The clause also requires the contractor to ensure each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct in 45 CFR part 5b and each contractor employee is aware that he or she is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act. These requirements also apply to all subcontracts awarded under the contract or order that require the design, development, or operation of a system of records.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.224-71, Confidential Information, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require access to Government or to third party information.

      Subpart 324.70—Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

        324.7000   Scope of subpart.

#### § 324.7000

        All individually identifiable health information that is Protected Health Information (PHI), as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 shall be administered in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) implementing regulations at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 (the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules). The term “HIPAA” is used in this part to refer to title II, subtitle F of the HIPAA statute, at part C of title XI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d  section 264 of HIPAA, subtitle D of title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and regulations under such provisions.

        324.7001   Policy on Compliance with HIPAA business associate contract requirements.

#### § 324.7001

        (a) HHS is a HIPAA “covered entity” that is a “hybrid entity” as these terms are defined at sections 160.103 and 164.103 respectively. As such, only the portions of HHS that the Secretary has designated as “health care components” (HCC) as defined at section 164.103, are subject to HIPAA. HHS' HCCs may utilize persons or entities known as “business associates,” as defined at section 160.103. Generally, “business associate” means a “person” as defined by section 160.103 (including contractors, and third-party vendors, etc.) if or when the person or entity:

        (1) Creates, receives, maintains, or transmits “protected health information”, as the term is defined at section 160.103, on behalf of an HHS HCC to carry out HHS HIPAA “covered functions” as that term is defined at 164.103; or

        (2) Provides certain services to an HHS HCC that involve PHI.

        (b) Where the Department as a covered entity is required by 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1) and 164.504(e) and, if applicable, sections 164.308(b)(3) and 164.314(a), to enter into a HIPAA business associate contract, the relevant HCC contracting officer, acting on behalf of the Department, shall ensure that such contract meets the requirements at section 164.504(e)(2) and, if applicable, section 164.314(a)(2).

        (b)  means an _Indian tribe_, pueblo, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native Village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688, 43 U.S.C. 1601), which the United States recognizes as eligible for special programs and services because of its status as Indian.

        (c)  means the governing body of any Indian tribe, or entity established or recognized by such governing body, in accordance with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77, 25 U.S.C. 1451).

        (a) When the contractor will perform work under a contract on an Indian reservation, the contracting officer may supplement the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program by adding specific Indian preference requirements of the tribe on whose reservation the contractor will work. The contracting activity and the tribe shall jointly develop supplemental requirements for the contract. Supplemental preference requirements shall represent a further implementation of the requirements of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and require the approval of the affected program director and the appropriate legal office, or a regional attorney, before the contracting officer adds them to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements the contracting officer adds to the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program shall also clearly identify in the solicitation the additional requirements.

        (b) Nothing in this part shall preclude tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference requirements. Such independently-developed tribal preference requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart, and shall not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement concerning the award and administration of contracts.

#### § 326.505

        The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-1, Indian Preference, and the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program, in contracts to implement section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 for all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) activities.

        Except as provided in HHSAR 326.602-2, this subpart applies to all acquisitions above the micro-purchase threshold, including simplified acquisitions, made by IHS, and any HHS operating divisions or agency outside of IHS conducting acquisitions on behalf of IHS.

#### § 326.603

        326.603-1   Requirement to give preference to Indian Economic Enterprises.

#### § 326.603-1

        (a) Except as provided by 25 U.S.C. 1633, IHS must use the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs whenever the use of that authority is practicable. Thus, IHS may use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring supplies, general services, A&E services, or construction to meet IHS needs and requirements. The Buy Indian Act does not apply when mandatory government sources are available, as required by FAR Part 8.002.

        (b) Contract awards under the authority of the Buy Indian Act can be pursued via the acquisition procedures prescribed in this HHSAR subpart in conjunction with the procedures from FAR part 12, 13, 14, 15 and/or 16.

        (c) The CO will give priority to ISBEEs for all purchases, regardless of dollar value, by utilizing ISBEE set-aside to the maximum extent possible. COs when prioritizing ISBEEs may consider either:

        (1) A set-aside for ISBEEs; or

        (2) A sole source award to an ISBEE, as authorized under the FAR.

        (d) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more ISBEEs that will be competitive in terms of market price, product quality, and delivery capability, the CO may consider either:

        (1) A set-aside for IEEs; or

        (2) A sole source award to an IEE, as authorized under the FAR.

        (e) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining two or more offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, product quality, and delivery capability, from ISBEEs and/or IEEs, then the CO shall follow the Deviation process under HHSAR 326.603-3.

        (f) Price analysis technique(s) provided in FAR 15.404-1(b) shall be used in determination of price fair and reasonableness when only one offer is received from a responsible ISBEE or IEE in response to an acquisition set-aside under paragraph (d)(1) or (e)(1) of this section:

        (1) If the offer meets the technical capability requirements and is not at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO may negotiate with that enterprise for a reasonable and fair market price, as authorized under the FAR.

        (2) If the offer meets the technical capability requirements and is at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO must:

        (i) Make an award to that enterprise;

        (ii) Document the reason only one offer was considered; and

        (iii) Initiate action to increase competition in future solicitations.

        (g) If the offers received in response to an acquisition set-aside under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section are determined to be unreasonable or otherwise unacceptable upon price and/or technical evaluations, then the CO must follow the Deviation process under HHSAR 326.603-3. The CO must document in the deviation determination the reasons why the IEE offeror(s) were not reasonable or otherwise unacceptable.

        (1) If a deviation determination is approved, the CO must cancel the current ISBEE or IEE set-aside solicitation and inform all offerors in writing.

        (2) If a deviation determination is approved, the CO must identify, based on current available market research, an alternate set-aside or procurement method.

        (3) When the solicitation of the same requirement is posted, the CO must inform all previous offerors in writing of the solicitation number.

        (h) With respect to construction, the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 1633 shall apply. Under 25 U.S.C. 1633, IHS may give a preference to an IEE unless the agency finds, after considering the evaluation criteria listed in 25 U.S.C. 1633, that the project to be contracted for will not be satisfactory or cannot be properly completed or maintained under the proposed contract.

        326.603-2   Delegations and responsibility.

#### § 326.603-2

        (a) The Director, IHS—exercises the authority of the Buy Indian Act pursuant to the Transfer Act of 1954, as delegated pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 1661. Under 25 U.S.C. 1661, the Director is authorized “to enter into contracts for the procurement of goods and services to carry out the functions of the IHS.” IHS exercises this authority in support of its mission and program activities and as a means of fostering Indian employment and economic development.

        (b) The IHS HCA is responsible for ensuring that all IHS acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act comply with the requirements of this part.

        326.603-3   Deviations.

#### § 326.603-3

        (a) There are certain instances where the application of the Buy Indian Act to an acquisition may not be appropriate. In these instances, the CO must detail the reasons in writing or via email and make a deviation determination.

        (b) Some acquisitions by their very nature would make such a written determination unnecessary. For example, any order or call placed against an indefinite delivery vehicle that already has an approved deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act.

        (c) Deviation determinations shall be required for all other acquisitions where the Buy Indian Act is applicable and must be approved as follows:

        (d) Deviations may be authorized prior to issuing the solicitation when the CO makes the following determinations and takes the following actions:

        (1) The CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality and delivery from two or more responsible ISBEEs or IEEs.

        (2) The deviation determination is authorized by the official listed at HHSAR 326.603-3(c) for the applicable contract action.

        (e) If a deviation determination has been approved, the CO must follow the FAR and HHSAR unless specified otherwise.

        (f) Acquisitions made under an authorized deviation from the requirements of the Buy Indian Act must be made in conformance with the order of precedence required by FAR Part 8.002.

        326.604-2   Procedures for Acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act.

#### § 326.604-2

        (a) Each acquisition of supplies, services and construction that is subject to commercial items or simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 or 13 must be set-aside exclusively for ISBEEs, except as otherwise set forth in this Part. IHS will use ISBEE commercial item(s) or simplified acquisition set-asides to accomplish this preference action.

        (b) Commercial items or simplified acquisitions under this section must conform to the competition and price reasonableness documentation requirements of FAR 12.209 for commercial item acquisitions and FAR 13.106 for simplified acquisitions.

        (c) When acquiring construction and A&E services, solicit proposals and evaluate potential contractors in accordance with FAR Part 36.

        (d) This paragraph applies to solicitations that are not restricted to participation of IEEs.

        (1) If an interested IEE is identified after a solicitation has been issued, but before the date established for receipt of offers, the contracting office must provide a copy of the solicitation to this enterprise. In this case, the CO:

        (i) Will not give preference under the Buy Indian Act to the IEE; and

        (ii) May extend the date for receipt of offers when practical.

        (2) If more than one IEE is identified after issuing a solicitation, but prior to the date established for receipt of offers, the CO may cancel the solicitation and re-compete it as an IEE set-aside.

        (e) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at HHSAR 352.226-4, NOTICE OF INDIAN SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE SET-ASIDE, in solicitations for acquisitions that are set-aside to ISBEE concerns under HHSAR 326.603-1(c).

        (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at HHSAR 352.226-5, NOTICE OF INDIAN ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE SET-ASIDE, in solicitations for acquisitions that are set-aside to IEE concerns in accordance with HHSAR 326.603-1(d).

        (2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at HHSAR 352.226-6, SUBCONTRACTING LIMITATIONS, in all solicitations and contracts when the contract award is to be made under the authority of the Buy Indian Act.

        (3) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at HHSAR 352.226-7, INDIAN ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE REPRESENTATION, in all solicitations when the contract award is to be made under the authority of the Buy Indian Act.

        326.604-3   Debarment and suspension.

#### § 326.604-3

        A misrepresentation by an offeror of its status as an IEE, failure to notify the CO of any change in IEE status that would make the contractor ineligible as an IEE, or any violation of the regulations in this part by an offeror or an awardee may lead to debarment or suspension in accordance with FAR 9.406 and 9.407 and HHSAR 309.406 and 309.407.

#### § 326.606

        326.606-1   General.

        (1) Certify that it meets the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” in response to a specific solicitation set-aside in accordance with the Buy Indian Act and this part; and

        (2) Identify the Indian Tribe(s) upon which the offeror relies for its IEE status.

        (c) The enterprise must meet the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” throughout the following time periods:

        (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a solicitation;

        (2) At the time of contract award; and

        (3) During the full term of the contract.

        (d) If, after award, a contractor no longer meets the eligibility requirements as it has certified and as set forth in this section, then the contractor must provide the CO with written notification within 3 calendar days of its failure to comply with the eligibility requirements. The notification must include:

        (2) A description of actions, if any, that must be taken to regain eligibility.

        (e) Failure to maintain eligibility under the Buy Indian Act or to provide written notification required by paragraph (d) of this section means that:

A CO will also investigate the representation if an interested party challenges the IEE representation or if the CO has any other reason to question the representation. The CO may ask the offeror for more information to substantiate the representation. Challenges of and questions concerning a specific representation must be referred to the CO or CCO in accordance with HHSAR 326.607.

        (g) Participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an IEE ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

        326.606-2   Representation provision.

#### § 326.606-2

        (a) Contracting offices must provide copies of the awardees' IEE representation to any interested parties upon written request. IHS will make awardees' IEE representations available via IHS public sites and/or other means.

The CO should make every effort to allow the offeror to correct the information. If the requirement is time sensitive the CO must specify to the offeror the time and date by which a response is required.

        (1) If the CO determines the offeror is not responsive, the CO must document the circumstances and inform the offeror of the determination.

        (2) The CO may ask the appropriate regional Office of the General Counsel to review the IEE representation.

        (3) The IEE representation does not relieve the CO of the obligation for determining contractor responsibility, as required by FAR Subpart 9.1.

        326.607   Challenges to Representation.

#### § 326.607

        326.607-1   Procedure.

#### § 326.607-1

        (a) The CO can accept an offeror's written representation of being an ISBEE or IEE (as defined in HHSAR 326.601) only when it is submitted in response to a Sources Sought Notice, Request for Information (RFI) or with an offer in response to a solicitation under the Buy Indian Act. Another interested party may challenge the representation of an offeror or awardee by filing a written challenge.

        (b) Upon receipt of the challenge, the CO shall re-verify the representation of the offeror or awardee in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, including the provisions of 326.606.

        326.607-2   Receipt of Challenge.

#### § 326.607-2

        (a) An interested party must file any challenges against an offeror's representation with the cognizant CO.

        (b) The challenge must be in writing and must contain the basis for the challenge with accurate, complete, specific and detailed evidence. The evidence must support the allegation that the offeror fails to meet the definition of Indian Economic Enterprise or Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise as defined in HHSAR 326.601 or is otherwise ineligible. The CO will dismiss any challenge that is deemed frivolous or that does not meet the conditions in this section.

        (c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 calendar days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (1) A challenge may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (2) A written challenge may be delivered by hand, email, or letter postmarked within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

        (3) A CO's challenge to a certification is always considered timely, whether filed before or after award.

        (d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:

        (1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration; and

        (2) Furnish to the offeror (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested or email.

        (e) Within 3 calendar days after receiving a copy of the challenge and the CO's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file, as specified at (d)(2), with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 calendar days, or another period of time granted by the CO, the CO may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and must not award to the challenged offeror.

        (f) Within 10 calendar days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response, and any other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested or email, and make known to all parties the option to appeal the determination to IHS DAP.

        (g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by DAP, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s).

        326.607-3   Award in the Face of Challenge.

#### § 326.607-3

        (a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge only may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.

        (1) This determination is final unless it is appealed to DAP, and the CO is notified of the appeal before award.

        (2) If an award was made before the CO received notice of appeal, the contract is presumed to be valid.

        (b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation. Award may be made in the face of a timely challenge when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, is urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.

        (c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the award will be withheld. The CO also may ask eligible offerors to extend the period for acceptance of their proposals.

        (d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended, the CO would follow those guidelines as outlined in FAR Part 49.

        326.607-4   Challenge Not Timely.

#### § 326.607-4

        If a CO receives an untimely filed challenge of a representation, the CO must notify the challenger that the challenge cannot be considered on the instant acquisition but will be considered in any future actions. However, the CO may question at any time, before or after award, the representation of an IEE.

        The Department of Health and Human Services applies the earned value management system requirement as follows:

        (a) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $20 million or more, the contractor's earned value management system shall comply with the guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748).

        (b) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $50 million or more, the contractor shall have an earned value management system that has been determined by the cognizant Federal agency to be in compliance with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.

        (c) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20 million—

        (1) The application of earned value management is optional at the discretion of the program/project manager and is a risk-based decision that must be supported by a cost/benefit analysis; and

        (2) A decision to apply earned value management shall be documented in the contract file.

        (d) For firm-fixed-price contracts and subcontracts of any dollar value the application of earned value management is discouraged.

        334.202   Integrated Baseline Reviews (IBRs).

#### § 334.202

        (a) An IBR normally should be conducted as a post-award activity. A pre-award IBR may be conducted only if—

        (1) The acquisition plan contains documentation that demonstrates the need and rationale for a pre-award IBR, including an assessment of the impact on the source selection schedule and the expected benefits;

        (2) The use of a pre-award IBR is approved in writing by the head of the contracting activity prior to the issuance of the solicitation;

        (3) The source selection plan and solicitation specifically addresses how the results of a pre-award IBR will be used during source selection, including any weight to be given to it in source evaluation; and

        (4) Specific arrangements are made, and budget authority is provided, to compensate all offerors who prepare for or participate in a pre-award IBR; and the solicitation informs prospective offerors of the means for and conditions of such compensation.

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 72151, Nov. 18, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

      335.070   Cost-sharing.

#### § 335.070

      335.070-1   Policy.

#### § 335.070-1

      (a) Contracting activities should encourage contractors to contribute to the cost of performing research and development (R&D), through the use of cost-sharing contracts, where there is a probability that the contractor will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303. Examples include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market and use of background knowledge in future contracts. Cost-sharing is intended to serve the mutual interests of the Government and its contractors by helping to ensure efficient utilization of the resources available for the conduct of R&D projects and by promoting sound planning and prudent fiscal policies of the contractor. The Government's interest includes positive impact on the community at large.

      (b) The contracting officer should use a cost-sharing contract for R&D contracts, unless the contracting officer determines that a request for cost-sharing would not be appropriate.

      (c) Any determination made by a contracting officer as described in this section shall be evidenced by appropriate documentation in the contract file.

      335.070-2   Amount of cost-sharing.

#### § 335.070-2

      When cost-sharing is appropriate, the contracting officer shall use the following guidelines to determine the amount of cost participation by the contractor:

      (a) The amount of cost participation depends on the extent to which the R&D effort or results are likely to enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive position, and the value of this enhancement to the contractor. Therefore, contractor cost participation could reasonably range from as little as one percent or less of the total project cost to more than 50 percent of the total project cost. Ultimately, cost-sharing is a negotiable item. As such, the amount of cost-sharing shall be proportional to the anticipated value of the contractor's gain.

      (b) If the contractor will not acquire title to, or the right to use, inventions, patents, or technical information resulting from the R&D project, it is normally appropriate to obtain less cost-sharing than in cases in which the contractor acquires these rights.

      (c) If the R&D is expected to be of only minor value to the contractor, and if a statute does not require cost-sharing, it may be appropriate for the contractor to make a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than sharing costs of the project. Alternatively, a limitation on indirect cost rates might be appropriate. See FAR 42.707. See also, FAR 16.303.

      (d) The contractor's participation may be considered over the total term of the project, so that a relatively high contribution in 1 year may be offset by a relatively low contribution in another. Care must be exercised that the intent to cost-share in future years does not become illusory. Redetermination of the cost sharing arrangement might be appropriate depending on future circumstances.

      (e) A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate if an area of R&D requires special stimulus in the national interest.

      335.070-3   Method of cost-sharing.

#### § 335.070-3

      Cost-sharing on individual contracts may be accomplished either by a contribution of part or all of one or more elements of allowable cost of the work being performed or by a fixed amount or stated percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. Contractors shall not charge costs contributed to the Government under any other instrument (e.g., grant or contract), including allocations to other instruments as part of any independent R&D program.

      335.071   [Reserved]

#### § 335.071

      335.072   Key personnel.

#### § 335.072

      If the contracting officer determines that the personnel to be assigned to perform effort on an R&D contract are critical to the success of the R&D effort, or were a critical factor in the award of the contract, then the contracting officer should consider using the key personnel clause at 352.237-75, Key Personnel.

        339.101   Policy

#### § 339.101

        In addition to the regulatory guidance in Federal Acquisition Regulation part 39, contracting officers shall collaborate with the requiring activity to ensure information technology (IT) acquisitions for supplies, services, and systems meet the requirements established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

#### § 339.203

        (a) Electronic and information technology (EIT) supplies and services must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the Act) of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Electronic and Information Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194). Requiring activities must consult with their Section 508 Official or designee to determine if the contractor should be responsible for compliance with EIT accessibility standards which apply to Web site content and communications material.

        (1) When conducting a procurement and employing the best value continuum, the solicitation shall include a separate technical evaluation factor developed by the contracting officer, requiring activity, and the Operating Division (OPDIV) Section 508 Official or designee.

        (2) At a minimum, solicitations for supplies and services shall require the submission of a Section 508 Product Assessment Template (See  for the template). Solicitations for services shall include any other pertinent information that the contracting officer deems necessary to evaluate the offeror's ability to meet the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards.

        (3) The HHS Operating Division or Staff Division (OPDIV or STAFFDIV) Section 508 Official or designee is responsible for providing technical assistance in development of Section 508 evaluation factors.

        (4) Before conducting negotiations or making an award, the contracting officer shall provide a summary of the Source Selection Evaluation Team's (SSET) assessment of offeror responses to the solicitation's Section 508 evaluation factor. This summary shall be submitted for review by the Section 508 Official or designee. The Section 508 Official or designee shall indicate approval or disapproval of the SSET assessment. The contracting officer shall coordinate the resolution of any issues raised by the Section 508 Official or designee with the chair of the SSET or requiring activity representative, as appropriate. The acquisition process shall not proceed until the Section 508 Official or designee approves the SSET assessment. The contracting officer shall include the assessment in the official contract file. See 339.204-1 regarding processing exception determination requests.

        (b) When acquiring commercial items, if no commercially available supplies or services meet all of the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, OPDIVs or STAFFDIVs shall, under the direction and approval of the Section 508 Official or designee, acquire the supplies and services that best meet the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. Process exception determinations for EIT supplies and services not meeting applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in accordance with 339.204-1.

        (b) In the development of an acquisition plan (AP) or other acquisition request document, the contracting officer shall ensure that all Section 508 exception determination requests for applicable EIT requirements are:

        (1) Documented and certified in accordance with the requirements of the HHS Section 508 policy;

        (2) Signed by the requestor in the requiring activity;

        (3) Certified and approved by the OPDIV Section 508 Official or designee; and

        (4) Included in the AP or other acquisition request document provided by the requiring activity to the contracting office.

        (c) For instances with an existing technical evaluation and no organization's proposed supplies or services meet all of the Section 508 accessibility standards; in order to proceed with the acquisition, the requiring activity shall provide an exception determination request along with the technical evaluation team's assessment of the Section 508 evaluation factor to the designated Section 508 Official or designee for review and approval or disapproval. The contracting officer shall include the Section 508 Official's or designee's approval or disapproval of the exception determination request in the official contract file and reference it, as appropriate, in all source selection documents. For further information, see HHS Section 508 Policy on .

        339.205   Section 508 accessibility standards for contracts.

#### § 339.205

        (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794(d)), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Section 508), specifies the applicable accessibility standards for all new solicitations and new or existing contracts or orders, regardless of EIT dollar amount.

        (b) The requiring activity shall consult with the OPDIV or STAFFDIV Section 508 Official or designee, as necessary, to determine the applicability of Section 508, identify applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and resolve any related issues before forwarding a request to the contracting or procurement office for the acquisition of EIT supplies and services—including Web site content and communications material for which the contractor must meet EIT accessibility standards.

        (c) Based on those discussions, the requiring activity shall provide a statement in the AP (or other acquisition request document) for Section 508 applicability. See 307.105. If Section 508 applies to an acquisition, include the provision at 352.239-73, Electronic and Information Technology and Accessibility Notice, language in a separate, clearly designated, section of the statement of work or performance work statement, along with any additional information applicable to the acquisition's Section 508 accessibility standards (e.g., the list of applicable accessibility standards of the Access Board EIT Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194)). If an AP does not address Section 508 applicability and it appears an acquisition involves Section 508, or if the discussion of Section 508 applicability to the acquisition is inadequate or incomplete, the contracting officer shall request the requiring activity modify the AP accordingly.

        (d) Items provided incidental to contract administration are not subject to this section.

        (e) The OPDIV Section 508 Official or designee may, at his or her discretion, require review and approval of solicitations and contracts for EIT supplies and services.

      Subpart 370.3—Acquisitions Involving Human Subjects

        370.300   Scope of subpart.

#### § 370.300

        This subpart applies to all research activities conducted under contracts involving human subjects. See 45 CFR 46.102(d) and (f).

        370.301   Policy.

#### § 370.301

        It is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy that the contracting officer shall not award a contract involving human subjects until the prospective contractor provides assurance that the activity will undergo initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103. The contracting officer shall require a Federal-wide assurance (FWA), approved by the HHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution engaged in human subjects research in performance of a contract. OHRP administers the assurance covering all HHS-supported or HHS-conducted activities involving human subjects.

        370.302   Federal-wide Assurance (FWA).

#### § 370.302

        (a) OHRP-Approved FWAs are found at the following Web site: .

        (b) Normally a contractor, subcontractor, or institution must provide approval of a FWA before a contract is awarded. If a contractor, subcontractor, or institution does not currently hold an approved FWA, it shall submit an explanation with its proposal and an FWA application prior to submitting a proposal. The contracting officer, on a case by case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OHRP.

        (c) A contractor, subcontractor, or institution must submit all FWAs, including new FWAs, using the electronic submission system available through the OHRP Web site at , unless an institution lacks the ability to do so electronically. If an institution believes it lacks the ability to submit its FWA electronically, it must contact OHRP by telephone or email (see ) and explain why it is unable to submit its FWA electronically.

        370.303   Notice to offerors.

#### § 370.303

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-4a, Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations that involve human subjects. The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I when the agency is prescribing a date later than the proposal submission by which the offeror must have an approved FWA.

        (b) Institutions having an OHRP-approved FWA shall certify IRB approval of submitted proposals in the manner required by instructions for completion of the contract proposal; by completion of an OMB Form No. 0990-0263, Protection of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption (Common Rule); or by letter indicating the institution's OHRP-assigned FWA number, the date of IRB review and approval, and the type of review (convened or expedited). The date of IRB approval must not be more than 12 months prior to the deadline for proposal submission.

        (c) The contracting officer generally will not request FWAs for contractors, subcontractors, or institutions prior to selecting a contract proposal for negotiation. When a contractor submits an FWA, it provides certification for the initial contract period; no additional documentation is required. If the contract provides for additional years to complete the project, the contractor shall certify annually in the manner described in 370.303(b).

        (d) For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-10, Notice to Offerors—Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in solicitations that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.

        370.304   Contract clauses.

#### § 370.304

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-4b, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations, contracts and orders involving human subjects.

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-6, Restriction on Use of Human Subjects, in contracts and orders if the contractor has an approved FWA of compliance in place, but cannot certify prior to award that an IRB registered with OHRP reviewed and approved the research, because definite plans for involvement of human subjects are not set forth in the proposal (e.g., projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds). Under these conditions, the contracting officer may make the award without the requisite certification, as long as the contracting officer includes appropriate conditions in the contract or order.

        (c) For FDA, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-11, Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in contracts and orders that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.

        (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-12, Needle Exchange, in solicitations, contracts, and orders involving human subjects.

        (e) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-13, Continued Ban on Funding Abortion and Continued Ban on Funding of Human Embryo Research, in solicitations, contracts, and orders involving human subjects.

      Subpart 370.4—Acquisitions Involving the Use of Laboratory Animals

        370.400   Scope of subpart.

#### § 370.400

Additional information can be found in Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals .

        370.401   Policy.

#### § 370.401

        (a) It is HHS policy that contracting activities shall not award a contract involving live vertebrate animals until the Contractor provides acceptable assurance the contract work is subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as described in the PHS Policy at IV.B.6 and 7. The contracting officer shall require an applicable Animal Welfare Assurance approved by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution having responsibility for animal care and use involved in performance of the contract. Normally the assurance shall be approved before award. The contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OLAW. For additional information see PHS Policy II., IV.A, and V.B.

        (b) The OLAW, NIH, is responsible for negotiating assurances covering all HHS/PHS-supported or HHS/PHS-conducted activities involving the care and use of live vertebrate animals. OLAW shall provide guidance to contracting officers regarding adequate animal care and use, approval, disapproval, restriction, or withdrawal of approval of assurances. For additional information see PHS Policy V.A.

        (c) If using live vertebrate animals, HHS policy requires that offerors address the points in the Vertebrate Animal Section (VAS) of the Technical Proposal. Each of the points must be addressed in the VAS portion of the Technical Proposal. For additional information see PHS Policy and use Contract Proposal VAS Worksheet.  and .

        370.402   Assurances.

#### § 370.402

        (a) Animal Welfare Assurances may be one of three types:

        (1)  A DA describes the institution's animal care and use program, including but not limited to the lines of authority and responsibility, veterinary care, IACUC composition and procedures, occupational health and safety, training, facilities, and species housed. A DA listed in OLAW's list of institutions with an approved DA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.

        (2)  The offeror, its proposed subcontractor, or institution shall submit an IA when it does not have a proprietary animal care and use program, facilities to house animals or IACUC, and does not conduct animal research on-site. The offeror will perform the animal activity at an institution with an Animal Welfare Assurance named as a performance site. An IA approval extends to the full period of contract performance (up to 5 years) limited to the specific award or single project.

        (3)  The Foreign Assurance is required for institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds directly through a contract award. The Foreign Assurance also applies to institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds indirectly (named as a performance site). An FA listed in OLAW's list of institutions with an approved FA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.

        (b) The contracting officer shall forward copies of proposals selected for negotiation and requiring an assurance to OLAW at , as early as possible to secure the necessary assurances.

        (c) A contractor providing animal care services at an institution with an Animal Welfare Assurance, such as a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) site, does not need a separate assurance. GOCO site assurances normally cover such contractor services.

        370.403   Notice to offerors.

#### § 370.403

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-5a, Notice to Offerors of Requirement for Compliance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, in solicitations involving live vertebrate animals.

        (b) Offerors having a DA on file with OLAW shall submit IACUC approval of the use of animals in the manner required by the solicitation, but prior to award. The date of IACUC approval must not be more than 36 months prior to award.

        (c) It is not necessary for offerors lacking an Animal Welfare Assurance to submit assurances or IACUC approval with proposals. OLAW shall contact contractors, subcontractors, and institutions to negotiate necessary assurances and verify IACUC approvals when requested by the contracting officer.

        370.404   Contract clause.

#### § 370.404

        The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-5b, Care of Live Vertebrate Animals, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that involve live vertebrate animals.
