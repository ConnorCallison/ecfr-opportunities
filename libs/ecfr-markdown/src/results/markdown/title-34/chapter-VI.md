    Subpart A—General Program Description

      § 681.1   What is the HEAL program?

#### § § 681.1

      (a) The Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program is a program of Federal insurance of educational loans that were made to graduate students in the fields of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatric medicine, pharmacy, public health, chiropractic, health administration, and clinical psychology. The basic purpose of the program is to encourage lenders to make loans to students in these fields who desire to borrow money to pay for their educational costs. In addition, certain nonstudents (such as doctors serving as interns or residents) could borrow in order to pay the current interest charges accruing on earlier HEAL loans. By taking a HEAL loan, the borrower is obligated to repay the lender or holder the full amount of the money borrowed, plus all interest which accrues on the loan.

      (b) HEAL loans were made by schools, banks, credit unions, State agencies, and other institutions eligible as lenders under § 681.30. HEAL school eligibility is described in § 681.50.

      (c) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the losses of principal and interest it may incur in the event that a borrower dies; becomes totally and permanently disabled; files for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a compliant to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his or her loan. In these instances, if the lender or holder has complied with all HEAL statutes and regulations and with the lender's or holder's insurance contract, then the Secretary pays the amount of the loss to the lender or holder and the borrower's loan is assigned to the Secretary. Only after assignment does the Secretary become the holder of the HEAL loan and the Secretary will use all collection methods legally authorized to obtain repayment of the HEAL loan, including, but not limited to, reporting the borrower's default on the loan to consumer credit reporting agencies, certifying the debt for offset in the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), using available methods to locate the debtor, utilizing administrative wage garnishment, and referring the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation.

      (d) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation in a HEAL loan transaction, bribes or attempts to bribe a Federal official, fraudulently obtains a HEAL loan, or commits any other illegal action in connection with a HEAL loan is subject to possible fine and imprisonment under Federal statute.

      (e) In counting the number of days allowed to comply with any provisions of these regulations, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are to be included. However, if a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the due date is the next Federal work day.

      (7) The borrower is entitled to deferment from repayment of the principal and interest installments during periods described in § 681.12.

      (8) The borrower may prepay the whole or any portion of the loan at any time without penalty.

    Subpart C—The Loan

      § 681.10   How much can be borrowed?

#### § § 681.10

      (a)  An eligible student may borrow an amount to be used solely for expenses, as described in § 681.5(g), incurred or to be incurred over a period of up to an academic year and disbursed in accordance with § 681.33(f). The maximum amount he or she may receive for that period shall be determined by the school in accordance with § 681.51(f) within the following limitations:

      (1) A student enrolled in a school of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry or podiatric medicine may borrow up to $80,000 under this part. The amount received may not exceed $20,000 in any academic year.

      (2) A student enrolled in a school of public health, pharmacy, or chiropractic, or a graduate program in health administration, clinical psychology, or allied health, may borrow up to $50,000 under this part. The amount received may not exceed $12,500 per academic year.

      (3) For purposes of this paragraph, an academic year means the traditional approximately 9-month September-to-June annual session. For the purpose of computing academic year equivalents for students who, during a 12-month period, attend for a longer period than the traditional academic year, the academic year will be considered to be 9 months in length.

      (4) The student's estimated cost of attendance shall not exceed the estimated cost of attendance of all students in like circumstances pursuing a similar curriculum at that school.

      (b)  An eligible nonstudent may borrow amounts under this authority with the following restrictions:

      (1) In no case may an eligible nonstudent borrower receive a loan that is greater than the sum of the HEAL insurance premium plus the interest that is expected to accrue and must be paid on the borrower's HEAL loans during the period for which the new loan is intended.

      (2) An eligible nonstudent in the field of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, or podiatric medicine may borrow up to $80,000 under this part including loans obtained while the borrower was a student. The loan amount may not exceed $20,000 in any 12-month period.

      (3) An eligible nonstudent in the field of pharmacy, public health, chiropractic, health administration, or clinical psychology may borrow up to $50,000 under this part including loans obtained while the borrower was a student. The loan amount received under this part may not exceed $12,500 in any 12-month period.

      § 681.11   Terms of repayment.

#### § § 681.11

      (a)  (1) The borrower's repayment period begins the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be a full-time student at a HEAL school. The 9-month period before the repayment period begins is popularly called the “grace period.”

      (i)  However, if the borrower becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program within 9 full months after leaving school, then the borrower's repayment period begins the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be an intern or resident. For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, this postponement of the beginning of the repayment period for participation in an internship or residency program is limited to 4 years.

      (ii)  For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, if the borrower becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program within 9 full months after leaving school, and subsequently enters into a fellowship training program or an educational activity, as described in § 681.12(b)(1) and (2), within 9 months after the completion of the accredited internship or residency program or prior to the completion of such program, the borrower's repayment period begins on the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be a participant in the fellowship training program or educational activity. Postponement of the commencement of the repayment period for either activity is limited to 2 years.

      (iii)  If a nonstudent borrower obtains another HEAL loan during the grace period or period of internship, residency, or deferment (as defined in § 681.12), the repayment period on this loan begins when repayment on the borrower's other HEAL loans begins or resumes.

      (2) An accredited internship or residency program must be approved by one of the following accrediting agencies:

      (i) Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

      (ii) Council on Optometric Education.

      (iii) Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Programs.

      (iv) American Osteopathic Association.

      (v) Council on Podiatry Education.

      (vi) American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.

      (vii) Council on Education for Public Health.

      (viii) American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

      (ix) Council on Chiropractic Education.

      (b)  In general, a lender or holder must allow a borrower at least 10 years, but not more than 25 years, to repay a loan calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. A borrower must fully repay a loan within 33 years from the date that the loan is made.

      (1) For a HEAL borrower who received any HEAL loan prior to October 22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in § 681.12) are not included when calculating the 10 to 25 or 33 year limitations.

      (2) For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in § 681.12) are included when calculating the 33 year limitation, but are not included when calculating the 10 to 25 year limitation.

      (c)  The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of the loan at any time without penalty.

      (d)  During each year of repayment, a borrower's payments to all holders of his or her HEAL loans must total the interest that accrues during the year on all of the loans, unless the borrower, in the promissory note or other written agreement, agrees to make payments during any year or any repayment period in a lesser amount.

      (e)  At least 30 and not more than 60 days before the commencement of the repayment period, a borrower must contact the holder of the loan to establish the precise terms of repayment. The borrower may select a monthly repayment schedule with substantially equal installment payments or a monthly repayment schedule with graduated installment payments that increase in amount over the repayment period. If the borrower does not contact the lender or holder and does not respond to contacts from the lender or holder, the lender or holder may establish a monthly repayment schedule with substantially equal installment payments, subject to the terms of the borrower's HEAL note.

      (f)  (1) A lender or holder and a borrower may enter into an agreement supplementing the regular repayment schedule agreement. Under a supplemental repayment agreement, the lender or holder agrees to consider that the borrower has met the terms of the regular repayment schedule as long as the borrower makes payments in accordance with the supplemental schedule.

      (2) The purpose of a supplemental repayment agreement is to permit a lender or holder, at its option, to offer a borrower a repayment schedule based on other than equal or graduated payments. (For example, a supplemental repayment agreement may base the amount of the borrower's payments on his or her income.)

      (3) The supplemental schedule must contain terms which, according to the Secretary, do not unduly burden the borrower and do not extend the Secretary's insurance liability beyond the number of years specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The supplemental schedule must be approved by the Secretary prior to the start of repayment.

      (4) The lender or holder may establish a supplemental repayment agreement over the borrower's objection only if the borrower's written consent to enter into a supplemental agreement was obtained by the lender at the time the loan was made.

      (5) A lender or holder may assign a loan subject to a supplemental repayment agreement only if it specifically notifies the buyer of the terms of the supplemental agreement. In such cases, the loan and the supplemental agreement must be assigned together.

      (6) As authorized by section 525 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, any repayment plan available under part B of title IV of the HEA (the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP)) is available for servicing, collecting, or enforcing HEAL loans. Such repayment plans are set forth in 34 CFR part 682, and in particular in §§ 682.102, 682.209, and 682.215.

      § 681.12   Deferment.

#### § § 681.12

      (a) After the repayment period has commenced, installments of principal and interest need not be paid during any period:

      (1) During which the borrower is pursuing a full-time course of study at a HEAL school or at an institution of higher education that is a “participating school” in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program;

      (2) Up to 4 years during which the borrower is a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2). For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, this total of 4 years for an internship or residency program includes any period of postponement of the repayment period, as described in § 681.11(a)(1);

      (3) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States;

      (4) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is in service as a volunteer under the Peace Corps Act;

      (5) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a member of the National Health Service Corps; or

      (6) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a full-time volunteer under title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.

      (b) For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, after the repayment period has commenced, installments of principal and interest need not be paid during any period for up to 2 years during which the borrower is a participant in:

      (1) A fellowship training program, which:

      (i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan;

      (ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the borrower's participation in such program;

      (iii) Is a full-time activity in research or research training or health care policy;

      (iv) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2);

      (v) Pays no stipend or one which is not more than the annual stipend level established by the Public Health Service for the payment of uniform levels of financial support for trainees receiving graduate and professional training under Public Health Service grants, as in effect at the time the borrower requests the deferment; and

      (vi) Is a formally established fellowship program which was not created for a specific individual; or

      (2) A full-time educational activity at an institution defined by section 435(b) of the HEA which:

      (i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan;

      (ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the borrower's participation in such program;

      (iii) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2); and

      (iv) Is required for licensure, registration, or certification in the State in which the borrower intends to practice the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan.

      (c)(1) To receive a deferment, including a deferral of the onset of the repayment period (see § 681.11(a)), a borrower must at least 30 days prior to, but not more than 60 days prior to, the onset of the activity and annually thereafter, submit to the lender or holder evidence of his or her status in the deferment activity and evidence that verifies deferment eligibility of the activity (with the full expectation that the borrower will begin the activity). It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the lender or holder with all required information or other information regarding the requested deferment. If written evidence that verifies eligibility of the activity and the borrower for the deferment, including a certification from an authorized official ( the director of the fellowship activity, the dean of the school, etc.), is received by the lender or holder within the required time limit, the lender or holder must approve the deferment. The lender or holder may rely in good faith upon statements of the borrower and the authorized official, except where those statements or other information conflict with information available to the lender or holder. When those verification statements or other information conflict with information available to the lender or holder, to indicate that the applicant fails to meet the requirements for deferment, the lender or holder may not approve the deferment until those conflicts are resolved.

      (2) For those activities described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary review a decision by the lender or holder denying the deferment by sending to the Secretary copies of the application for deferment and the lender's or holder's denial of the request. However, if information submitted to the lender or holder conflicts with other information available to the lender or holder, to indicate that the borrower fails to meet the requirements for deferment, the borrower may not request a review until such conflicts have been resolved. During the review process, the lender or holder must comply with any requests for information made by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the fellowship or educational activity is eligible for deferment and so notifies the lender or holder, the lender or holder must approve the deferment.

      § 681.13   Interest.

#### § § 681.13

      (a)  At the lender's option, the interest rate on the HEAL loan may be calculated on a fixed rate or on a variable rate basis. However, whichever method is selected must continue over the life of the loan, except where the loan is consolidated with another HEAL loan.

      (1) For all loans made on or after October 22, 1985, for each calendar quarter, the Secretary determines the maximum annual HEAL interest rate by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates reported for the 91-day U.S. Treasury bills auctioned for the preceding calendar quarter, adding 3 percentage points, and rounding that amount to the next higher one-eighth of 1 percent.

      (2) Interest that is calculated on a fixed rate basis is determined for the life of the loan during the calendar quarter in which the loan is executed. It may not exceed the rate determined for that quarter by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (3) Interest that is calculated on a variable rate basis varies every calendar quarter throughout the life of the loan as the market price of U.S. Treasury bills changes. For any quarter it may not exceed the rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (4) The Secretary announces the rate determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on a quarterly basis through a notice published on the Department's student aid Web site at .

      (b)  Interest accrues from the date the loan is disbursed until the loan is paid in full. Unpaid accrued interest shall be compounded not more frequently than semiannually and added to principal. However, a lender or holder may postpone the compounding of interest before the beginning of the repayment period or during periods of deferment or forbearance and add interest to principal at the time repayment of principal begins or resumes.

      (c)  Repayment of principal and interest is due when the repayment period begins. A lender or holder must permit a borrower to postpone paying interest before the beginning of the repayment period or during a period of deferment or forbearance. In these cases, payment of interest begins or resumes on the date repayment of principal begins or resumes.

      (d)  No provision of any Federal or State law that limits the rate or amount of interest payable on loans shall apply to a HEAL loan.

      § 681.14   The insurance premium.

#### § § 681.14

      (a)  (1) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the losses of principal and interest it may incur in the event that a borrower dies; becomes totally and permanently disabled; files for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his or her loan. For this insurance, the Secretary charges the lender an insurance premium. The insurance premium is due to the Secretary on the date of disbursement of the HEAL loan.

      (2) The lender may charge the borrower an amount equal to the cost of the insurance premium. The cost of the insurance premium may be charged to the borrower by the lender in the form of a one-time special charge with no subsequent adjustments required. The lender may bill the borrower separately for the insurance premium or may deduct an amount attributable to it from the loan proceeds before the loan is disbursed. In either case, the lender must clearly identify to the borrower the amount of the insurance premium and the method of calculation.

      (3) If the lender does not pay the insurance premium on or before 30 days after disbursement of the loan, a late fee will be charged on a daily basis at the same rate as the interest rate that the lender charges for the HEAL loan for which the insurance premium is past due. The lender may not pass on this late fee to the borrower.

      (4) HEAL insurance coverage ceases to be effective if the insurance premium is not paid within 60 days of the disbursement of the loan.

      (5) Except in cases of error, premiums are not refundable by the Secretary, and need not be refunded by the lender to the borrower, even if the borrower graduates or withdraws from the school, defaults, dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled.

      (b)  The rate of the insurance premium shall not exceed the statutory maximum. The Secretary announces changes in the rate of the insurance premium through a notice published on the Department's student aid Web site: .

      (c) —(1)  For loans disbursed prior to July 22, 1986, the lender must calculate the insurance premium on the basis of the number of months beginning with the month following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed to the student borrower and ending 9 full months after the month of the student's anticipated date of graduation. For loans disbursed on or after July 22, 1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-time flat rate on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.

      (2)  For loans disbursed prior to July 22, 1986, the lender must calculate the insurance premium for nonstudent borrowers on the basis of the number of months beginning with the month following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed to the borrower and ending at the conclusion of the month preceding the month in which repayment of principal is expected to begin or resume on the borrower's previous HEAL loans. For loans disbursed on or after July 22, 1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-time flat rate on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.

      (3)  In cases where the lender disburses the loan in multiple installments, the insurance premium is calculated for each disbursement.

      § 681.15   Other charges to the borrower.

#### § § 681.15

      (a)  If the borrower fails to pay all of a required installment payment or fails to provide written evidence that verifies eligibility for the deferment of the payment within 30 days after the payment's due date, the lender or holder will require that the borrower pay a late charge. A late charge must be equal to 5 percent of the unpaid portion of the payment due.

      (b)  The lender or holder may also require that the borrower pay the holder of the note for reasonable costs incurred by the holder or its agent in collecting any installment not paid when due. These costs may include attorney's fees, court costs, telegrams, and long-distance phone calls. The holder may not charge the borrower for the normal costs associated with preparing letters and making personal and local telephone contacts with the borrower. A service agency's fee for normal servicing of a loan may not be passed on to the borrower, either directly or indirectly. No charges, other than those authorized by this section, may be passed on to the borrower, either directly or indirectly, without prior approval of the Secretary.

      (c)  A lender may not pass on to the borrower any cost of making a HEAL loan other than the costs of the insurance premium.

      § 681.16   Power of attorney.

#### § § 681.16

      Neither a lender nor a school may obtain a borrower's power of attorney or other authorization to endorse a disbursement check on behalf of a borrower. The borrower must personally endorse the check and may not authorize anyone else to endorse it on his or her behalf.

      § 681.17   Security and endorsement.

#### § § 681.17

      (a) A HEAL loan must be made without security.

      (b) With one exception, it must also be made without endorsement. If a borrower is a minor and cannot under State law create a legally binding obligation by his or her own signature, a lender may require an endorsement by another person on the borrower's HEAL note. For purposes of this paragraph, an “endorsement” means a signature of anyone other than the borrower who is to assume either primary or secondary liability on the note.

      § 681.18   Consolidation of HEAL loans.

#### § § 681.18

      HEAL loans may be consolidated as permitted in 34 CFR 685.220.

      § 681.19   Forms.

#### § § 681.19

      All HEAL forms are approved by the Secretary and may not be changed without prior approval by the Secretary. HEAL forms shall not be signed in blank by a borrower, a school, a lender or holder, or an agent of any of these. The Secretary may prescribe who must complete the forms, and when and to whom the forms must be sent. All HEAL forms must contain a statement that any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation in a HEAL loan transaction, bribes or attempts to bribe a Federal official, fraudulently obtains a HEAL loan, or commits any other illegal action in connection with a HEAL loan is subject to possible fine and imprisonment under Federal statute.

      § 681.20   The Secretary's collection efforts after payment of a default claim.

#### § § 681.20

      After paying a default claim on a HEAL loan, the Secretary attempts to collect from the borrower and any valid endorser in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105), the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, issued January 2013, and the Department's Claims Collection Regulation (34 CFR parts 30, 31, and 34). The Secretary attempts collection of all unpaid principal, interest, penalties, administrative costs, and other charges or fees, except in the following situations:

      (a)  The Secretary refrains from collection against the borrower or endorser to the extent of any defense that the Secretary concludes is valid. Examples of a valid defense include infancy or proof of repayment in part or in full.

      (b)  In this situation, the Secretary refrains from collection to the extent of the unpaid refund if the borrower assigns to the Secretary the right to receive the refund.

      (c)  In this situation, if the Secretary determines that the proceeding involves allegations that, if proven, would provide the borrower with a full or partial defense on the loan, then the Secretary may suspend collection activity on all or part of a loan until the proceeding ends. The Secretary suspends collection activity only for so long as the proceeding is being energetically prosecuted in good faith and the allegations that relate to the borrower's defense are reasonably likely to be proven.

      (d)  In this situation, the Secretary terminates all collection activity against the borrower. The Secretary follows the procedures and standards in 34 CFR 685.213 and 34 CFR 685.212(a) to determine if the borrower is totally and permanently disabled. If the borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled, the Secretary also terminates all collection activity against any endorser.

      § 681.21   Refunds.

#### § § 681.21

      (a)  By applying for a HEAL loan, a student authorizes a participating school to make payment of a refund that is allocable to a HEAL loan directly to the original lender (or to a subsequent holder of the loan note, if the school has knowledge of the holder's identity).

      (b)  (1) A holder of a HEAL loan must treat a refund payment received from a HEAL school as a downward adjustment in the principal amount of the loan.

      (2) When a lender receives a school refund check for a loan it no longer holds, the lender must transfer that payment to the holder of the loan and either inform the borrower about the refund check and where it was sent or, if the borrower's address is unknown, notify the current holder that the borrower was not informed. The current holder must provide the borrower with a written notice of the refund payment.

    Subpart D—The Lender and Holder

      § 681.30   Which organizations are eligible to apply to be HEAL lenders and holders?

#### § § 681.30

      (a) A HEAL lender may hold loans under the HEAL program.

      (b) The following types of organizations were eligible to apply to the Secretary to be HEAL lenders:

      (1) A financial or credit institution (including a bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or insurance company) which is subject to examination and supervision in its capacity as a lender by an agency of the United States or of the State in which it has its principal place of business;

      (2) A pension fund approved by the Secretary;

      (3) An agency or instrumentality of a State; and

      (4) A private nonprofit entity, designated by the State, regulated by the State, and approved by the Secretary.

      (c) The following types of organizations are eligible to apply to the Secretary to be HEAL holders:

      (1) Public entities in the business of purchasing student loans;

      (2) Navient (formerly known as the Student Loan Marketing Association, or “Sallie Mae”); and

      (3) Other eligible lenders.

      (d) HEAL holders must comply with any provisions in the regulations required of HEAL lenders including, but not limited to, provisions regarding applications, contracts, and due diligence.

      § 681.31   The application to be a HEAL lender or holder.

#### § § 681.31

      (a) In order to be a HEAL lender or holder, an eligible organization must submit an application to the Secretary annually.

      (b) In determining whether to enter into an insurance contract with an applicant and what the terms of that contract should be, the Secretary may consider the following criteria:

      (1) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with the requirements in the HEAL regulations applicable to lenders and holders;

      (2) The amount and rate of loans which are currently delinquent or in default, if the applicant has had prior experience with similar Federal or State student loan programs; and

      (3) The financial resources of the applicant.

      (c) The applicant must develop and follow written procedures for servicing and collecting HEAL loans. These procedures must be reviewed during the biennial audit required by § 681.42(d). If the applicant uses procedures more stringent than those required by §§ 681.34 and 681.35 for its other loans of comparable dollar value, on which it has no Federal, State, or other third party guarantee, it must include those more stringent procedures in its written procedures for servicing and collecting its HEAL loans.

      (d) The applicant must submit sufficient materials with his or her application to enable the Secretary to fairly evaluate the application in accordance with these criteria.

      § 681.32   The HEAL lender or holder insurance contract.

#### § § 681.32

      (a)(1) If the Secretary approves an application to be a HEAL lender or holder, the Secretary and the lender or holder must sign an insurance contract. Under this contract, the lender or holder agrees to comply with all the laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its participation in the HEAL program and the Secretary agrees to insure each eligible HEAL loan held by the lender or holder against the borrower's default, death, total and permanent disability, bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act when the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan. The Secretary's insurance covers 100 percent of the lender's or holder's losses on both unpaid principal and interest, except to the extent that a borrower may have a defense on the loan other than infancy.

      (2) HEAL insurance, however, is not unconditional. The Secretary issues HEAL insurance on the implied representations of the lender that all the requirements for the initial insurability of the loan have been met. HEAL insurance is further conditioned upon compliance by the holder of the loan with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's or holder's insurance contract, and its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c). The contract may contain a limit on the duration of the contract and the number or amount of HEAL loans a lender may make or hold. Each HEAL lender has either a standard insurance contract or a comprehensive insurance contract with the Secretary, as described below.

      (b)  A lender with a standard insurance contract must submit to the Secretary a borrower's loan application for HEAL insurance on each loan that the lender determines to be eligible. The Secretary notifies the lender whether the loan is or is not insurable, the amount of the insurance, and the expiration date of the insurance commitment. A loan which has been disbursed under a standard contract of insurance prior to the Secretary's approval of the application is considered not to have been insured.

      (c)(1)  A lender with a comprehensive insurance contract may disburse a loan without submitting an individual borrower's loan application to the Secretary for approval. All eligible loans made by a lender with this type of contract are insured immediately upon disbursement.

      (2) The Secretary will revoke the comprehensive contract of any lender who utilizes procedures which are inconsistent with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's insurance contract, or its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c), and require that such lenders disburse HEAL loans only under a standard contract. When the Secretary determines that the lender is in compliance with the HEAL statute and regulations and its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c), the lender may reapply for a comprehensive contract.

      (3) In providing comprehensive contracts, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible lenders that:

      (i) Make loans to students at interest rates below the rates prevailing during the period involved; or

      (ii) Make loans under terms that are otherwise favorable to the student relative to the terms under which eligible lenders are generally making loans during the period involved.

      § 681.33   Making a HEAL loan.

#### § § 681.33

      The loan-making process includes the processing of necessary forms, the approval of a borrower for a loan, determination of a borrower's creditworthiness, the determination of the loan amount (not to exceed the amount approved by the school), the explanation to a borrower of his or her responsibilities under the loan, the execution of the promissory note, and the disbursement of the loan proceeds. A lender may rely in good faith upon statements of an applicant and the HEAL school contained in the loan application papers, except where those statements are in conflict with information obtained from the report on the applicant's credit history, or other information available to the lender. Except where the statements are in conflict with information obtained from the applicant's credit history or other information available to the lender, a lender making loans to nonstudent borrowers may rely in good faith upon statements by the borrower and authorizing officials of internship, residency, or other programs for which a borrower may receive a deferment.

      (a)  Before making a HEAL loan, a lender must determine that all required forms have been completed by the borrower, the HEAL school, the lender, and the authorized official for an internship, a residency, or other deferment activity.

      (b)  A lender may make a HEAL loan only to an eligible student or nonstudent borrower.

      (c)  The lender may make HEAL loans only to an applicant that the lender has determined to be creditworthy. This determination must be made at least once for each academic year during which the applicant applies for a HEAL loan. An applicant will be determined to be “creditworthy” if he or she has a repayment history that has been satisfactory on any loans on which payments have become due. The lender may not determine that an applicant is creditworthy if the applicant is currently in default on any loan (commercial, consumer, or educational) until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between the affected lender(s) and the HEAL applicant. The lender must obtain documentation, such as a letter from the authorized official(s) of the affected lender(s) or a corrected credit report indicating that the HEAL applicant has taken satisfactory actions to bring the account into good standing. It is the responsibility of the HEAL loan applicant to assure that the lender receives each such documentation. No loan may be made to an applicant who is delinquent on any Federal debt until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between the affected agency and the HEAL applicant. The lender must receive a letter from the authorized Federal official of the affected Federal agency stating that the borrower has taken satisfactory actions to bring the account into good standing. It is the responsibility of the loan applicant to assure that the lender has received each such letter. The absence of any previous credit, however, is not an indication that the applicant is not creditworthy and is not to be used as a reason to deny the status of creditworthy to an applicant. The lender must determine the creditworthiness of the applicant using, at a minimum, the following:

      (1) A report of the applicant's credit history obtained from an appropriate consumer credit reporting agency, which must be used in making the determinations required by paragraph (c) of this section; and

      (2) For student applicants only, the certification made by the applicant's school under § 681.51(e).

      (d)  A lender may not make a HEAL loan in an amount that exceeds the permissible annual and aggregate maximums described in § 681.10.

      (e)  (1) Each loan must be evidenced by a promissory note approved by the Secretary. A lender must obtain the Secretary's prior approval of the note form before it makes a HEAL loan evidenced by a promissory note containing any deviation from the provisions of the form most currently approved by the Secretary. The lender must give the borrower a copy of each executed note.

      (2) The lender must explain to the borrower that the loan must be repaid and that the loan proceeds may be applied toward educational expenses only.

      (f)  (1) A lender must disburse HEAL loan proceeds:

      (i) To a student borrower, by means of a check or draft payable jointly to the student borrower and the HEAL school. Except where a lender is also a school, a lender must mail the check or draft to the school. A lender may not disburse the loan proceeds earlier than is reasonably necessary to meet the cost of education for the period for which the loan is made.

      (ii) To a nonstudent borrower, by means of a check or draft payable to the borrower. However, when a previous loan is held by a different lender, the current lender must make the HEAL loan disbursement check or draft payable jointly to the borrower and the holder of the previous HEAL loan for which interest is payable.

      (2) Effective July 1, 1987, a lender must disburse the HEAL loan proceeds in two or more installments unless the loan is intended to cover a period of no more than one-half an academic year. The amount disbursed at one time must correspond to the borrower's educational expenses for the period for which the disbursement is made, and must be indicated by the school on the borrower's application. If the loan is intended for more than one-half an academic year, the school must indicate on the borrower's application both the approximate dates of disbursement and the amount the borrower will need on each such date. In no case may the lender disburse the proceeds earlier than is reasonably necessary to meet the costs of education for the period for which the disbursement or the loan is made.

      (g) If the lender determines that the applicant is not creditworthy, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the lender must not approve the HEAL loan request. If the applicant is a student, the lender must notify the applicant and the applicant's school named on the application form of the denial of a HEAL loan, stating the reason for the denial.

      (h) The lender must report a borrower's HEAL indebtedness to one or more national credit bureaus within 120 days of the date the final disbursement on the loan is made.

      § 681.34   HEAL loan account servicing.

#### § § 681.34

      HEAL loan account servicing involves the proper maintenance of records, and the proper review and management of accounts. Generally accepted account servicing standards ensure that collections are received and accounted for, delinquent accounts are identified promptly, and reports are produced comparing actual results to previously established objectives.

      (a)  A lender or holder must respond on a timely basis to written inquiries and other communications from a borrower and any endorser of a HEAL loan.

      (b)  (1) At least 30 and not more than 60 days before the commencement of the repayment period, the lender or holder must contact the borrower in writing to establish the terms of repayment. Lenders or holders may not charge borrowers for the additional interest or other charges, penalties, or fees that accrue when a lender or holder does not contact the borrower within this time period and a late conversion results.

      (2) Terms of repayment are established in a written schedule that is made a part of, and subject to the terms of, the borrower's original HEAL note.

      (3) The lender or holder may not surrender the original promissory note to the borrower until the loan is paid in full. At that time, the lender or holder must give the borrower the original promissory note.

      (c)  The lender or holder must contact each borrower to request updated contact information for the borrower and to notify the borrower of the balance owed for principal, interest, insurance premiums, and any other charges or fees owed to the lender, at least every 6 months from the time the loan is disbursed. The lender or holder must use this notice to remind the borrower of the option, without penalty, to pay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any time.

      (d)  If, at any time, the lender or holder is unable to locate a borrower, the lender or holder must initiate skip-tracing procedures as described in § 682.411.

      § 681.35   HEAL loan collection.

#### § § 681.35

      A lender or holder must exercise due diligence in the collection of a HEAL loan with respect to both a borrower and any endorser. In order to exercise due diligence, a lender or holder must implement the following procedures when a borrower fails to honor his or her payment obligations:

      (a) When a borrower is delinquent in making a payment, the lender or holder must remind the borrower within 15 days of the date the payment was due by means of a written contact. If payments do not resume, the lender or holder must contact both the borrower and any endorser at least 3 more times at regular intervals during the 120-day delinquent period following the first missed payment of that 120-day period. The second demand notice for a delinquent account must inform the borrower that the continued delinquent status of the account will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies if payment is not made. Each of the required four contacts must consist of at least a written contact which has an address correction request on the envelope. The last contact must consist of a telephone contact, in addition to the required letter, unless the borrower cannot be contacted by telephone. The lender or holder may choose to substitute a personal contact for a telephone contact. A record must be made of each attempt to contact and each actual contact, and that record must be placed in the borrower's file. Each contact must become progressively firmer in tone. If the lender or holder is unable to locate the borrower and any endorser at any time during the period when the borrower is delinquent, the lender or holder must initiate the skip-tracing procedures described in § 681.34(d).

      (b) When a borrower is 90 days delinquent in making a payment, the lender or holder must immediately request preclaim assistance from the Department's servicer. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if the lender or holder fails to request preclaim assistance.

      (c) Prior to the filing of a default claim, a lender or holder must use, at a minimum, collection practices that are at least as extensive and effective as those used by the lender or holder in the collection of its other loans. These practices must include, but need not be limited to:

      (1) Using collection agents, which may include its own collection department or other internal collection agents;

      (2) Immediately notifying an appropriate consumer credit reporting agency regarding accounts overdue by more than 60 days; and

      (3) Commencing and prosecuting an action for default unless:

      (i) In the determination of the Secretary that:

      (A) The lender or holder has made reasonable efforts to serve process on the borrower involved and has been unsuccessful in these efforts; or

      (B) Prosecution of such an action would be fruitless because of the financial or other circumstances of the borrower;

      (ii) For loans made before November 4, 1988, the loan involved was made in an amount of less than $5,000; or

      (iii) For loans made on or after November 4, 1988, the loan involved was made in an amount of less than $2,500.

      (d) If the Secretary's preclaim assistance locates the borrower, the lender or holder must implement the loan collection procedures described in this section. When the Secretary's preclaim assistance is unable to locate the borrower, a default claim may be filed by the lender as described in § 681.40. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if the lender or holder has not complied with the HEAL statute and regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract.

      (e) If a lender or holder does not sue the borrower, it must send a final demand letter to the borrower and any endorser at least 30 days before a default claim is filed.

      (f) If a lender or holder sues a defaulted borrower or endorser, it may first apply the proceeds of any judgment against its reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, whether or not the judgment provides for these fees and costs.

      (g)  (1) If a borrower files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and does not file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the lender or holder is responsible for monitoring the bankruptcy case in order to pursue collection of the loan after the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed.

      (i) For any loan for which the lender or holder had not begun to litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic stay, the period of the automatic stay is to be considered as an extended forbearance authorized by the Secretary, in addition to the 2-year period of forbearance which lenders and holders are authorized to grant without prior approval from the Secretary. Only periods of delinquency following the date of receipt (as documented by a date stamp) of the discharge of debtor notice (or other written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney of the end of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court) can be included in determining default, as described in § 681.40(c)(1)(i). The lender or holder must attempt to reestablish repayment terms with the borrower in writing no more than 30 days after receipt of the discharge of debtor notice (or other written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney of the end of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court), in accordance with the procedures followed at the end of a forbearance period. If the borrower fails to make a payment as scheduled, the lender or holder must attempt to obtain repayment through written and telephone contacts in accordance with the intervals established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and must perform the other HEAL loan collection activities required in this section, before filing a default claim.

      (ii) For any loan for which the lender or holder had begun to litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lender or holder must, upon written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney that the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed, either resume litigation or treat the loan in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.

      (2) If the lender or holder has not received written notification of discharge within 12 months of the date that the borrower filed for bankruptcy, the lender or holder must contact the court and the borrower's attorney (if known) within 30 days to determine if the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed. If no response is received within 30 days of the date of these contacts, the lender or holder must resume its collection efforts, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If a written response from the court or the borrower's attorney indicates that the bankruptcy proceedings are still underway, the lender or holder is not to pursue further collection efforts until receipt of written notice of discharge, except that follow-up in accordance with this paragraph must be done at least once every 12 months until the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed. A lender or holder may utilize PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) in place of contact with the court and/or borrower's attorney.

      (3) If, despite the lender or holder's compliance with required procedures, a loan subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section is discharged, the lender or holder must file a claim with the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt (as documented by a date stamp) of written notification of the discharge from the court or the borrower's attorney, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 681.40(c)(4). The lender or holder also must file with the bankruptcy court an objection to the discharge of the HEAL loan, and must include with the claim documentation showing that the bankruptcy proceedings were handled properly and expeditiously ( all documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court, including evidence which shows the period of the bankruptcy proceedings).

      § 681.36   Consequence of using an agent.

#### § § 681.36

      The delegation of functions to a servicing agency or other party does not relieve a lender or holder of its responsibilities under the HEAL program.

      § 681.37   Forbearance.

#### § § 681.37

      (a)  means an extension of time for making loan payments or the acceptance of smaller payments than were previously scheduled to prevent a borrower from defaulting on his or her payment obligations. A lender or holder must notify each borrower of the right to request forbearance.

      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a lender or holder must grant forbearance whenever the borrower is temporarily unable to make scheduled payments on a HEAL loan and the borrower continues to repay the loan in an amount commensurate with his or her ability to repay the loan. Any circumstance which affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan must be fully documented.

      (2) If the lender or holder determines that the default of the borrower is inevitable and that forbearance will be ineffective in preventing default, the lender or holder may submit a claim to the Secretary rather than grant forbearance. If the Secretary is not in agreement with the determination of the lender or holder, the claim will be returned to the lender or holder as disapproved and forbearance must be granted.

      (b) A lender or holder must exercise forbearance in accordance with terms that are consistent with the 25- and 33-year limitations on the length of repayment (described in § 681.11) if the lender or holder and borrower agree in writing to the new terms. Each forbearance period may not exceed 6 months.

      (c) A lender or holder may also exercise forbearance for periods of up to 6 months in accordance with terms that are inconsistent with the minimum annual payment requirement if the lender or holder complies with the requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Subsequent renewals of the forbearance must also be documented in accordance with the following requirements:

      (1) The lender or holder must reasonably believe that the borrower intends to repay the loan but is currently unable to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan note. The lender or holder must state the basis for its belief in writing and maintain that statement in its loan file on that borrower.

      (2) Both the borrower and an authorized official of the lender or holder must sign a written agreement of forbearance.

      (3) If the agreement between the borrower and lender or holder provides for forbearance of all payments, the lender or holder must contact the borrower at least every 3 months during the period of forbearance in order to remind the borrower of the outstanding obligation to repay.

      (4) The total period of forbearance (with or without interruption) granted by the lender or holder to any borrower must not exceed 2 years. However, when the borrower and the lender or holder believe that there are bona fide reasons why this period should be extended, the lender or holder may request a reasonable extension beyond the 2-year period from the Secretary. This request must document the reasons why the extension should be granted. The lender or holder may grant the extension for the approved time period if the Secretary approves the extension request.

      § 681.38   Assignment of a HEAL loan.

#### § § 681.38

      A HEAL note may not be assigned except to another HEAL lender or organization as specified in § 681.30 and except as provided in § 681.40. In this section “seller” means any kind of assignor and “buyer” means any kind of assignee.

      (a)  A HEAL note assigned from one lender or holder to another must be subject to a blanket endorsement together with other HEAL notes being assigned or must individually bear effective words of assignment. Either the blanket endorsement or the HEAL note must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the seller. Within 30 days of the transaction, the buyer must notify the following parties of the assignment:

      (1) The Secretary; and

      (2) The borrower. The notice to the borrower must contain a clear statement of all the borrower's rights and responsibilities which arise from the assignment of the loan, including a statement regarding the consequences of making payments to the seller subsequent to receipt of the notice.

      (b)  Upon acquiring a HEAL loan, a new holder assumes responsibility for the consequences of any previous violations of applicable statutes, regulations, or the terms of the note except for defects under § 681.41(d). A HEAL note is not a negotiable instrument, and a subsequent holder is not a holder in due course. If the borrower has a valid legal defense that could be asserted against the previous holder, the borrower can also assert the defense against the new holder. In this situation, if the new holder files a default claim on a loan, the Secretary denies the default claim to the extent of the borrower's defense. Furthermore, when a new holder files a claim on a HEAL loan, it must provide the Secretary with the same documentation that would have been required of the original lender.

      (c)  Nothing in this section precludes the buyer of a HEAL loan from obtaining a warranty from the seller covering certain future reductions by the Secretary in computing the amount of insurable loss, if any, on a claim filed on the loan. The warranty may only cover reductions which are attributable to an act or failure to act of the seller or other previous holder. The warranty may not cover matters for which the buyer is charged with responsibility under the HEAL regulations.

      (d)  If a lender or holder assigns a HEAL loan to a new holder, or a new holder acquires a HEAL loan under 20 U.S.C. 1092a (the Combined Payment Plan authority), and the previous holder(s) subsequently receives court notice that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, the previous holder(s) must forward the bankruptcy notice to the purchaser within 10 days of the initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp, except that if it is a chapter 7 bankruptcy with no complaint for dismissal, the previous holder(s) must file the notice with the purchaser within 30 days of the initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. The previous holder(s) also must file a statement with the court notifying it of the change of ownership. Notwithstanding the above, the current holder will not be held responsible for any loss due to the failure of the prior holder(s) to meet the deadline for giving notice if such failure occurs after the current holder purchased the loan.

      § 681.39   Death and disability claims.

#### § § 681.39

      (a)  The Secretary will discharge a borrower's liability on the loan in accordance with section 738 of the Act upon the death of the borrower. The holder of the loan may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or any endorser. The holder must secure a certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under State law. The holder must return to the sender any payments in accordance with § 685.212(a) received from the estate of the borrower or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of death.

      (b)  The Secretary will discharge a borrower's liability on the loan in accordance with 34 CFR 685.213.

      § 681.40   Procedures for filing claims.

#### § § 681.40

      (a) A lender or holder must file an insurance claim on a form approved by the Secretary. The lender or holder must attach to the claim all documentation necessary to litigate a default, including any documents required to be submitted by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, and which the Secretary may require. Failure to submit the required documentation and to comply with the HEAL statute and regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract will result in a claim not being honored. The Secretary may deny a claim that is not filed within the period specified in this section. The Secretary requires for all claims at least the following documentation:

      (1) The original promissory note;

      (2) An assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note;

      (3) The loan application;

      (4) The history of the loan activities from the date of loan disbursement through the date of claim, including any payments made; and

      (5) A Borrower Status Form (HEAL-508), documenting each deferment granted under § 681.12 or a written statement from an appropriate official stating that the borrower was engaged in an activity for which he or she was entitled to receive a deferment at the time the deferment was granted.

      (b) The Secretary's payment of a claim is contingent upon receipt of all required documentation and an assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note underlying the claim. The lender or holder must warrant that the loan is eligible for HEAL insurance.

      (c) In addition, the lender or holder must comply with the following requirements for the filing of default, death, disability, and bankruptcy claims:

      (1)  means the persistent failure of the borrower to make a payment when due or to comply with other terms of the note or other written agreement evidencing a loan under circumstances where the Secretary finds it reasonable to conclude that the borrower no longer intends to honor the obligation to repay the loan. In the case of a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in monthly installments, this failure must have persisted for 120 days. In the case of a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in less frequent installments, this failure must have persisted for 180 days. If, for a particular loan, an automatic stay is imposed on collection activities by a Bankruptcy Court, and the lender or holder receives written notification of the automatic stay prior to initiating legal proceedings against the borrower, the 120- or 180-day period does not include any period prior to the end of the automatic stay.

      (i) If a lender or holder determines that it is not appropriate to commence and prosecute an action against a default borrower pursuant to § 681.35(c)(3), it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 30 days after a loan has been determined to be in default.

      (ii) If a lender files suit against a defaulted borrower and does not pursue collection of the judgment obtained as a result of the suit, it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 60 days of the date of issuance of the judgment. If a lender or holder files suit against a defaulted borrower, and pursues collection of the judgment obtained as a result of the suit, these collection activities must begin within 60 days of the date of issuance of the judgment. If the lender or holder is unable to collect the full amount of principal and interest owed, a claim must be filed within 30 days of completion of the post-judgment collection activities. In either case, the lender or holder must assign the judgment to the Secretary as part of the default claim.

      (iii) In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its default claim at least the following:

      (A) Repayment schedule(s);

      (B) A collection history, if any;

      (C) A final demand letter;

      (D) The original or a copy of all correspondence relevant to the HEAL loan to or from the borrower (whether received by the original lender, a subsequent holder, or an independent servicing agent);

      (E) A claims collection litigation report; and

      (F) If the defaulted borrower filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and did not file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, all documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court, including evidence which shows the period of the bankruptcy proceedings.

      (iv) If a lender or holder files a default claim on a loan and subsequently receives written notice from the court or the borrower's attorney that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 with a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, the lender or holder must file that notice with the Secretary within 10 days of the lender or holder's initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the borrower is declaring bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, and has not filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, the lender or holder must file the written notice with the Secretary within 30 days of the lender's or holder's initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the Secretary has not paid the claim at the time the lender or holder receives that notice, upon receipt of the notice, the lender or holder must file with the bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. If the Secretary has paid the claim, the lender or holder must file a statement with the court notifying it that the loan is owned by the Secretary.

      (2)  A lender or holder must file a death claim with the Secretary within 30 days after the lender or holder obtains documentation that a borrower is dead. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its death claim those documents which verify the death, including an official copy of the Death Certificate.

      (3)  A lender or holder must file a disability claim with the Secretary within 30 days after it has been notified that the Secretary has determined a borrower to be totally and permanently disabled. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its claim evidence of the Secretary's determination that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled.

      (4)  For a bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or a bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act when the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the current holder must file a claim with the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt of court notice or written notice from the borrower's attorney that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or chapter 13, or has filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan under chapter 7. The initial date of receipt of the written notice must be documented by a date stamp. The lender or holder must file with the bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, with its claim the lender or holder must submit to the Secretary at least the following:

      (i) Repayment schedule(s);

      (ii) A collection history, if any;

      (iii) A proof of claim, where applicable;

      (iv) An assignment to the United States of America of its proof of claim, where applicable;

      (v) All pertinent documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court;

      (vi) A statement of any facts of which the lender is aware that may form the basis for an objection to the bankrupt's discharge or an exception to the discharge;

      (vii) The notice of the first meeting or creditors, or an explanation as to why this is not included;

      (viii) In cases where there is defective service, a declaration or affidavit attesting to the fact that the lender or holder was not directly served with the notice of meeting of creditors. This declaration or affidavit must also indicate when and how the lender or holder learned of the bankruptcy; and

      (ix) In cases where there is defective service due to the borrower's failure to list the proper creditor, a copy of the letter sent to the borrower at the time of purchase of the HEAL loan by the current holder, or a sample letter with documentation indicating when the letter was sent to the borrower.

      § 681.41   Determination of amount of loss on claims.

#### § § 681.41

      (a)  HEAL insurance covers the unpaid balance of principal and interest on an eligible HEAL loan, less the amount of any judgment collected pursuant to default proceedings commenced by the eligible lender or holder involved. In determining whether to approve an insurance claim for payment, the Secretary considers legal defects affecting the initial validity or insurability of the loan. The Secretary also deducts from a claim any amount that is not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower except to the extent that the defense of infancy applies. The Secretary further considers whether all holders of the loan have complied with the requirements of the HEAL regulations, including those concerned with the making, servicing, and collecting of the loan, the timely filing of claims, and the submission of documents with a claim.

      (b)  If a claim is filed by a lender or holder that obtained a loan by assignment, that lender or holder is not entitled to any payment under this section greater than that to which a previous holder would have been entitled. In particular, the Secretary deducts from the claim any amounts that are attributable to payments made by the borrower to a prior holder of the loan before the borrower received proper notice of the assignment of the loan.

      (c)  (1) If the loan for which a claim is filed was originally made by a school and the claim is filed by that school, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount equal to any unpaid refund that the school owes the borrower.

      (2) If the loan for which a claim is filed was originally made by a school but the claim is filed by another lender of holder that obtained the note by assignment, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount equal to any unpaid refund that the school owed the borrower prior to the assignment.

      (d)  The Secretary may permit a lender or holder to cure certain defects in a specified manner as a condition for payment of a default claim. The Secretary may excuse certain defects if the holder submitting the default claim satisfies the Secretary that the defect did not contribute to the default or prejudice the Secretary's attempt to collect the loan from the borrower. The Secretary may also excuse certain defects if the defect arose while the loan was held by another lender or holder and the holder submitting the default claim satisfies the Secretary that the assignment of the loan was an arm's length transaction, that the present holder did not know of the defect at the time of the sale and that the present holder could not have become aware of the defect through an examination of the loan documents.

      (e)  The payment on an approved claim covers the unpaid principal balance and interest that accrues through the date the claim is paid, except:

      (1) If the lender or holder failed to submit a claim within the required period after the borrower's default; death; total and permanent disability; or filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 where the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; the Secretary does not pay interest that accrued between the end of that period and the date the Secretary received the claim.

      (2) If the Secretary returned the claim to the lender or holder for additional documentation necessary for the approval of the claim, the Secretary pays interest only for the first 30 days following the return of the claim to the lender or holder.

      § 681.42   Records, reports, inspection, and audit requirements for HEAL lenders and holders.

#### § § 681.42

      (a)  (1) A lender or holder must keep complete and accurate records of each HEAL loan which it holds. The records must be organized in a way that permits them to be easily retrievable and allows the ready identification of the current status of each loan. The required records include:

      (i) The loan application;

      (ii) The original promissory note;

      (iii) The repayment schedule agreement;

      (iv) Evidence of each disbursement of loan proceeds;

      (v) Notices of changes in a borrower's address and status as a full-time student;

      (vi) Evidence of the borrower's eligibility for a deferment;

      (vii) The borrower's signed statement describing his or her rights and responsibilities in connection with a HEAL loan;

      (viii) The documents required for the exercise of forbearance;

      (ix) Documentation of the assignment of the loan; and

      (x) Evidence of a borrower's creditworthiness, including the borrower's credit report.

      (2) The lender or holder must maintain for each borrower a payment history showing the date and amount of each payment received on the borrower's behalf, and the amounts of each payment attributable to principal and interest. A lender or holder must also maintain for each loan a collection history showing the date and subject of each communication with a borrower or endorser for collection of a delinquent loan. Furthermore, a lender or holder must keep any additional records which are necessary to make any reports required by the Secretary.

      (3) A lender or holder must retain the records required for each loan for not less than 5 years following the date the loan is repaid in full by the borrower. However, in particular cases the Secretary may require the retention of records beyond this minimum period. A lender or holder must keep the original copy of an unpaid promissory note, but may store all other records in microform or computer format.

      (4) The lender or holder must maintain accurate and complete records on each HEAL borrower and related school activities required by the HEAL program. All HEAL records shall be maintained under security and protected from fire, flood, water leakage, other environmental threats, electronic data system failures or power fluctuations, unauthorized intrusion for use, and theft.

      (b)  A lender or holder must submit reports to the Secretary at the time and in the manner required by the Secretary.

      (c)  Upon request, a lender or holder must afford the Secretary, the Comptroller General of the United States, and any of their authorized representatives access to its records in order to assure the correctness of its reports.

      (d) The lender or holder must comply with the Department's biennial audit requirements of section 705 of the Act.

      (e) Any lender or holder who has information which indicates potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the United States, involving these loan funds, must promptly provide this information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for Investigations.

      § 681.43   Limitation, suspension, or termination of the eligibility of a HEAL lender or holder.

#### § § 681.43

      (a) The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the eligibility under the HEAL program of an otherwise eligible lender or holder that violates or fails to comply with any provision of the Act, these regulations, or agreements with the Secretary concerning the HEAL program. Prior to terminating a lender or holder's participation in the program, the Secretary will provide the entity an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b)(1) The Secretary will provide any lender or holder subject to termination with a written notice, sent by certified mail, specifying his or her intention to terminate the lender or holder's participation in the program and stating that the entity may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the entity requests a hearing, it must, within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:

      (i) The request for a hearing is untimely ( fails to meet the 30-day requirement);

      (ii) The lender or holder does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or

      (iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.

      (2) In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will send a written denial, by certified mail, to the lender or holder setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be necessary, the lender or holder will be terminated from participation in the program. An entity will be permitted to reapply for participation in the program when it demonstrates, and the Secretary agrees, that it is in compliance with all HEAL requirements.

      (c) This section does not apply to a determination that a HEAL lender fails to meet the statutory definition of an “eligible lender.”

      (d) This section also does not apply to administrative action by the Department of Education based on any alleged violation of:

      (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is governed by 34 CFR part 100;

      (2) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which is governed by 34 CFR part 106;

      (3) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended), which is governed by 34 CFR part 99; or

      (4) Title XI of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, Public Law 95-630 (12 U.S.C. 3401-3422).

    Subpart E—The School

      § 681.50   Which schools are eligible to be HEAL schools?

#### § § 681.50

      (a) In order to participate in the HEAL program, a school must enter into a written agreement with the Secretary. In the agreement, the school promises to comply with provisions of the HEAL law and the HEAL regulations. For initial entry into this agreement and for the agreement to remain in effect, a school must satisfy the following requirements:

      (1)(i) The school must be legally authorized within a State to conduct a course of study leading to one of the following degrees:

      (A) Doctor of Medicine.

      (B) Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.

      (C) Doctor of Dentistry or equivalent degree.

      (D) Bachelor or Master of Science in Pharmacy or equivalent degree.

      (E) Doctor of Optometry or equivalent degree.

      (F) Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or equivalent degree.

      (G) Doctor of Podiatric Medicine or equivalent degree.

      (H) Graduate or equivalent degree in Public Health.

      (I) Doctor of Chiropractic or equivalent degree.

      (J) Doctoral degree of Clinical Psychology.

      (K) Masters or doctoral degree in Health Administration.

      (2)(i) The school must be accredited by a recognized agency approved for that course of study by the Secretary of Education, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, except where a school is not eligible for accreditation solely because it is too new. A new school is eligible if the Secretary of Education determines that it can reasonably expect to be accredited before the beginning of the academic year following the normal graduation date of its first entering class. The Secretary of Education makes this determination after consulting with the appropriate accrediting agency and receiving reasonable assurance to that effect.

      (ii) The approved accrediting agencies are:

      (A) Liaison Committee on Medical Education.

      (B) American Osteopathic Association, Bureau of Professional Education.

      (C) American Dental Association, Commission on Dental Accreditation.

      (D) American Veterinary Medical Association, Council on Education.

      (E) American Optometric Association, Council on Optometric Education.

      (F) American Podiatric Medical Association, Council on Podiatric Medical Education.

      (G) Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education.

      (H) Council on Education for Public Health.

      (I) Council on Chiropractic Education, Commission on Accreditation.

      (J) Accrediting Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education.

      (K) American Psychological Association, Committee on Accreditation.

      (b) If a HEAL school undergoes a change of controlling ownership or form of control, its agreement automatically expires at the time of that change. The school must enter into a new agreement with the Secretary in order to continue its participation in the HEAL program.

      § 681.51   The student loan application.

#### § § 681.51

      When the student completes his or her portion of the student loan application and submits it to the school, the school must do the following:

      (a) Accurately and completely fill out its portion of the HEAL application;

      (b) Verify, to the best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the HEAL application, including, but not limited to, citizenship status and Social Security number. To comply with this requirement, the school may request that the student provide a certified copy of his or her birth certificate, his or her naturalization papers, and an original Social Security card or copy issued by the Federal Government, or other documentation that the school may require. The school must assure that the applicant's I-151 or I-551 is attached to the application, if the applicant is required to possess such identification by the United States;

      (c) Certify that the student is eligible to receive a HEAL loan, according to the requirements of § 681.5;

      (d) Review the financial aid transcript from each institution previously attended by the applicant on at least a half-time basis to determine whether the applicant is in default on any loans or owes a refund on any grants. The school may not approve the HEAL application or disburse HEAL funds if the borrower is in default on any loans or owes a refund on any educational grants, unless satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and the affected lender or school to resolve the default or the refund on the grant. If the financial aid transcript has been requested, but has not been received at the time the applicant submits his or her first HEAL application, the school may approve the application and disburse the first HEAL installment prior to receipt of the transcript. Each financial aid transcript must include at least the following data:

      (1) Student's name;

      (2) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by the student for study at an institution of higher education;

      (3) Whether the student is in default on any of these loans, or owes a refund on any grants;

      (4) Certification from each institution attended by the student that the student has received no financial aid, if applicable; and

      (5) From each institution attended, the signature of an official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on behalf of the institution;

      (e) State that it has no reason to believe that the borrower may not be willing to repay the HEAL loan;

      (f) Make reasonable determinations of the maximum loan amount approvable, based on the student's circumstances. The student applicant determines the amount he or she wishes to borrow, up to this maximum amount. Only then may the school certify an eligible application. In determining the maximum loan amount approvable, the school will calculate the difference between:

      (1) The total financial resources available to the applicant for his or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan, and other student aid that the applicant has received or will receive during the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan. To determine the total financial resources available to the applicant for his or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan (including familial, spousal, or personal income or other financial assistance that the applicant has received or will receive), the school must consider information provided through one of the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by the Secretary of Education, in addition to any other information which the school has regarding the student's financial situation. The school may make adjustments to the need analysis information only when necessary to accurately reflect the applicant's actual resources, and must maintain in the borrower's record documentation to support the basis for any adjustments to the need analysis information; and

      (2) The costs reasonably necessary for each student to pursue the same or similar curriculum or program within the same class year at the school for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan, using a standard student budget. The school must maintain in its general office records the criteria used to develop each standard student budget. Adjustments to the standard student budget may be made only to the extent that they are necessary for the student to complete his or her education, and documentation must be maintained in the borrower's record to support the basis for any adjustments to the standard student budget.

      (g) Comply with the requirements of § 681.61.

      § 681.52   The student's loan check.

#### § § 681.52

      (a) When a school receives from a HEAL lender a loan disbursement check or draft payable jointly to the school and to one of its students, it must:

      (1) If the school receives the instrument after the student is enrolled, obtain the student's endorsement, retain that portion of funds due the school, and disburse the remaining funds to the student.

      (2) If the school receives the instrument before the student is enrolled, it must, prior to endorsing the instrument, send the instrument to the student to endorse and return to the school. The school may then retain that portion of funds then due the school but must hold the remaining funds for disbursement to the student at the time of enrollment. However, if the student is unable to meet other educational expenses due before the time of enrollment, the school may obtain the student's endorsement and disburse to the student that portion of funds required to meet these other educational expenses.

      (b) If a school determines that a student does not plan to enroll, the school must return a loan disbursement check or draft to the lender within 30 days of this determination.

      § 681.53   Notification to lender or holder of change in enrollment status.

#### § § 681.53

      Each school must notify the holder of a HEAL loan of any change in the student's enrollment status within 30 days following the change in status. Each notice must contain the student's full name under which the loan was received, the student's current name (if different), the student's Social Security number, the date of the change in the enrollment status, or failure to enroll as scheduled for any academic period as a full-time student, the student's latest known permanent and temporary addresses, and other information which the school may decide is necessary to identify or locate the student. If the school does not know the identity of the current holder of the HEAL loan, it must notify the HEAL Program Office of a change in the student's enrollment status. This notification is not required for vacation periods and leaves of absence or other temporary interruptions which do not exceed one academic term.

      § 681.54   Payment of refunds by schools.

#### § § 681.54

      A participating school must pay that portion of a refund that is allocable to a HEAL loan directly to the original lender (or to a subsequent holder of the loan note, if the school has knowledge of the holder's identity).

#### § § 681.60

      (a) The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the eligibility under the HEAL program of an otherwise eligible school that violates or fails to comply with any provision of the Act, these regulations, or agreements with the Secretary concerning the HEAL program.

      (b)(1) The Secretary will provide any school subject to termination with a written notice, sent by certified mail, specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must, within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:

      (i) The request for a hearing is untimely ( fails to meet the 30-day requirement);

      (ii) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or

      (iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.

      (2) In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will send a written denial, by certified mail, to the school setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be terminated from participation in the program. A school will be permitted to reapply for participation in the program when it demonstrates, and the Secretary agrees, that it is in compliance with all HEAL requirements.

      (c) This section does not apply to a determination that a HEAL school fails to meet the statutory definition of an “eligible school.”

      (d) This section does not apply to administrative action by the Department of Education based on any alleged violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended), as governed by 34 CFR part 99.

      § 681.61   Responsibilities of a HEAL school.

#### § § 681.61

      (a) A HEAL school is required to carry out the following activities for each HEAL applicant or borrower:

      (1) Conduct and document an entrance interview with each student (individually or in groups) no later than prior to the loan recipient's first HEAL disbursement in each academic year that the loan recipient obtains a HEAL loan. The school must inform the loan recipient during the entrance interview of his or her rights and responsibilities under a HEAL loan, including the consequences for noncompliance with those responsibilities, and must gather personal information which would assist in locating the loan recipient should he or she depart from the school without receiving an exit interview. A school may meet this requirement through correspondence where the school determines that a face-to-face meeting is impracticable.

      (2) Conduct and document an exit interview with each HEAL loan recipient (individually or in groups) within the final academic term of the loan recipient's enrollment prior to his or her anticipated graduation date or other departure date from the school. The school must inform the loan recipient in the exit interview of his or her rights and responsibilities under each HEAL loan, including the consequences for noncompliance with those responsibilities. The school must also collect personal information from the loan recipient which would assist the school or the lender or holder in skiptracing activities and to direct the loan recipient to contact the lender or holder concerning specific repayment terms and options. A copy of the documentation of the exit interview, including the personal information collected for skiptracing activities, and any other information required by the Secretary regarding the exit interview must be sent to the lender or holder of each HEAL loan within 30 days of the exit interview. If the loan recipient departs from the school prior to the anticipated date or does not receive an exit interview, the exit interview information must be mailed to the loan recipient by the school within 30 days of the school's knowledge of the departure or the anticipated departure date, whichever is earlier. The school must request that the loan recipient forward any required information ( skiptracing information, request for deferment, etc.) to the lender or holder. The school must notify the lender or holder of the loan recipient's departure at the same time it mails the exit interview material to the loan recipient.

      (3) Verify the accuracy and completeness of information provided by each student on the HEAL loan application, particularly in regard to the HEAL eligibility requirements, by comparing the information with previous loan applications or other records or information provided by the student to the school. Notify the potential lender of any discrepancies which were not resolved between the school and the student.

      (4) Develop and implement procedures relating to check receipt and release which keep these functions separate from the application preparation and approval process and assure that the amount of the HEAL loan check(s) does(do) not exceed the approved total amount of the loan and the statutory maximums. Checks must not be cashed without the borrower's personal endorsement. Documentation of these procedures and their usage shall be maintained by the school.

      (5) Maintain accurate and complete records on each HEAL borrower and related school activities required by the HEAL program. All HEAL records shall be properly safeguarded and protected from environmental threats and unauthorized intrusion for use and theft.

      (6) Maintain documentation of the criteria used to develop the school's standard student budgets in the school's general records, readily available for audit purposes, and maintain in each HEAL borrower's record a copy of the standard budget which was actually used in the determination of the maximum loan amount approvable for the student, as described in § 681.51.

      (7) Notify the lender or its assignee of any changes in the student's name, address, status, or other information pertinent to the HEAL loan not more than 30 days after receiving information indicating such a change.

      (b) Any school which has information which indicates potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the United States involving these loan funds must promptly provide this information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for Investigations.

      (c) The school will be considered responsible and the Secretary may seek reimbursement from any school for the amount of a loan in default on which the Secretary has paid an insurance claim, if the Secretary finds that the school did not comply with the applicable HEAL statute and regulations, or its written agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary may excuse certain defects if the school satisfies the Secretary that the defect did not contribute to the default or prejudice the Secretary's attempt to collect the loan from the borrower.

      (d) A school is authorized to withhold services from a HEAL borrower who is in default on a HEAL loan received while enrolled in that school, except in instances where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. Such services may include, but are not limited to academic transcripts and alumni services. Defaulted HEAL borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy shall provide court documentation that verifies the filing for bankruptcy upon the request of the school. Schools will also supply this information to the Secretary upon request. All academic and financial aid transcripts that are released on a defaulted HEAL borrower must indicate on the transcript that the borrower is in default on a HEAL loan. It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the school with documentation from the lender, holder, or Department when a default has been satisfactorily resolved, in order to obtain access to services that are being withheld, or to have the reference to default removed from the academic and financial aid transcripts.

  PART 682—FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN (FFEL) PROGRAM

### Part 682

**Authority:** Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1071-1087-4, unless otherwise noted.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 60323, Dec. 18, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Scope

      § 682.100   The Federal Family Education Loan programs.

#### § § 682.100

      (a) This part governs the following four programs collectively referred to in these regulations as “the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs,” in which lenders used their own funds prior to July 1, 2010, to make loans to enable a student or his or her parents to pay the costs of the student's attendance at postsecondary schools.

      (1) The Federal Stafford Loan (Stafford) Program, which encouraged making loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

      (2) The Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994, which encouraged making loans to graduate, professional, independent undergraduate, and certain dependent undergraduate students.

      (3) The Federal PLUS (PLUS) Program, which encouraged making loans to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Before October 17, 1986, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate, professional, and independent undergraduate students. Before July 1, 1993, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to parents of dependent graduate students. The PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate and professional students on or after July 1, 2006 and prior to July 1, 2010.

      (4) The Federal Consolidation Loan Program (Consolidation Loan Program), which encouraged making loans to borrowers for the purpose of consolidating loans: under the Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL), Stafford loan, SLS, ALAS (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, Perkins Loan programs, the Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) including Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Program authorized by subpart II of part A of Title VII of the Public Health Services Act, Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) authorized by subpart I of Part A of Title VII of the Health Services Act, Nursing Student Loan Program loans authorized by subpart II of part B of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and existing loans obtained under the Consolidation Loan Program, and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program loans, if the application for the Consolidation loan was received on or after November 13, 1997 and prior to July 1, 2010.

      (b)(1) Except for the loans guaranteed directly by the Secretary described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a guaranty agency guarantees a lender against losses due to default by the borrower on a FFEL loan. If the guaranty agency meets certain Federal requirements, the guaranty agency is reimbursed by the Secretary for all or part of the amount of default claims it pays to lenders.

      (2)(i) The Secretary guarantees lenders against losses—

      (A) Within the Stafford Loan Program, on loans made under Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program;

      (B) Within the PLUS Program, on loans made under the Federal PLUS Program;

      (C) Within the SLS Program, on loans made under the Federal SLS Program as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994; and

      (D) Within the Consolidation Loan Program, on loans made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program.

      (ii) The loan programs listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section collectively are referred to in these regulations as the “Federal Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs.”

      (iii) The Federal GSL programs were authorized to operate in States not served by a guaranty agency program. In addition, the FISL and Federal SLS (as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994) programs were authorized, under limited circumstances, to operate in States in which a guaranty agency program did not serve all eligible students.

      § 682.101   Participation in the FFEL programs.

#### § § 682.101

      The following entities and persons participate in the FFEL programs:

      (a) Eligible banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, pension funds, insurance companies, schools, and State and private nonprofit agencies made loans prior to July 1, 2010.

      (b) Institutions of higher education, including most colleges, universities, graduate and professional schools, and many vocational, technical schools participated as schools, enabling an eligible student or his or her parents to obtain a loan to pay for the student's cost of education.

      (c) Students who met certain requirements, including enrollment at a participating school, borrowed under the Stafford Loan Program prior to July 1, 2010 and, for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994, the SLS program. Parents of eligible dependent undergraduate students borrowed under the PLUS Program prior to July 1, 2010. Borrowers with outstanding Stafford, SLS, FISL, Perkins, HPSL, HEAL, ALAS, PLUS, or Nursing Student Loan Program loans borrowed under the Consolidation Loan Program prior to July 1, 2010. The PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate and professional students on or after July 1, 2006 and prior to July 1, 2010.

> [57 FR 60323, Dec. 18, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 61215, Nov. 29, 1994; 64 FR 18975, Apr. 16, 1999; 66 FR 34762, June 29, 2001; 71 FR 45698, Aug. 9, 2006; 71 FR 64397, Nov. 1, 2006; 78 FR 65806, Nov. 1, 2013]

      § 682.102   Repaying a loan.

#### § § 682.102

      (a)  Generally, the borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan, late fees, collection costs chargeable to the borrower, and any interest not payable by the Secretary. The borrower's obligation to repay is cancelled if the borrower dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy. A parent borrower's obligation to repay a PLUS loan is cancelled if the student, on whose behalf the parent borrowed, dies. The borrower's or student's obligation to repay all or a portion of his or her loan may be cancelled if the student is unable to complete his or her program of study because the school closed or the borrower's or student's eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school. The obligation to repay all or a portion of a loan may be forgiven for Stafford Loan borrowers who enter certain areas of the teaching profession.

      (b)  In the case of a subsidized Stafford loan, a borrower is not required to make any principal payments during the time the borrower is in school. The Secretary pays the interest on the borrower's behalf during the time the borrower is in school. When the borrower ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a grace period begins during which no principal payments are required, and the Secretary continues to make interest payments on the borrower's behalf. In the case of an unsubsidized Stafford loan, the borrower is responsible for interest during these periods. At the end of the grace period, the repayment period begins. During the repayment period, for the subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loan, the borrower pays both the principal and the interest accruing on the loan.

      (c)  Generally, the repayment period for an SLS loan begins immediately on the day of the last disbursement of the loan proceeds by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on an SLS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed unless a borrower who is also a Stafford loan borrower, but who has not yet entered repayment on the Stafford loan, requests that commencement of repayment on the SLS loan be deferred until the borrower's grace period on the Stafford loan expires.

      (d)  Generally, the repayment period for a PLUS loan begins on the day the loan is fully disbursed by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on a PLUS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed.

      (e)  Generally, the repayment period for a Consolidation loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed. The first payment of principal and interest on a Consolidation loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the borrower's liability on all loans being consolidated has been discharged.

      (f)  Repayment of principal on a FFEL program loan may be deferred under the circumstances described in § 682.210.

      (g)  If a borrower defaults on a loan, the guarantor reimburses the lender for the amount of its loss. The guarantor then collects the amount owed from the borrower.

      (a) Subpart B of this part contains general provisions that are applicable to all participants in the FFEL and Federal GSL programs.

      (b) The administration of the FFEL programs by a guaranty agency is subject to subparts C, D, F, and G of this part.

      (c) The Federal FFEL and Federal GSL programs are subject to subparts C, F, and G of this part.

      (d) Certain requirements applicable to schools under all the FFEL and Federal GSL programs are set forth in subpart F of this part.

Voluntary payments are payments made directly by the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax off-set, garnishment, or income or asset execution. “On-time” means a payment received by the Secretary or a guaranty agency or its agent within 20 days of the scheduled due date.

      (3) A borrower has not used the one opportunity to renew eligibility for title IV assistance if the borrower makes six consecutive, on-time, voluntary, full monthly payments under an agreement to rehabilitate a defaulted loan but does not receive additional title IV assistance prior to defaulting on that loan again.

      § 682.208   Due diligence in servicing a loan.

#### § § 682.208

      (a) The loan servicing process includes reporting to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, responding to borrower inquiries, establishing the terms of repayment, and reporting a borrower's enrollment and loan status information.

      (b)(1) An eligible lender of a FFEL loan shall report to each nationwide consumer reporting agency—

      (i) The total amount of FFEL loans the lender has made to the borrower, within 90 days of each disbursement;

      (ii) The outstanding balance of the loans;

      (iii) Information concerning the repayment status of the loan, no less frequently than every 90 days or quarterly after a change in that status from current to delinquent;

      (iv) The date the loan is fully repaid by, or on behalf of, the borrower, or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, or total and permanent disability, within 90 days after that date;

      (v) Other information required by law to be reported.

      (2) An eligible lender that has acquired a FFEL loan shall report to each nationwide consumer reporting agency the information required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)-(v) of this section within 90 days of its acquisition of the loan.

      (3) Upon receipt of a valid identity theft report as defined in section 603(q)(4) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a) or notification from a consumer reporting agency that information furnished by the lender is a result of an alleged identity theft as defined in § 682.402(e)(14), an eligible lender shall suspend consumer reporting agency reporting for a period not to exceed 120 days while the lender determines the enforceability of a loan.

      (i) If the lender determines that a loan does not qualify for a discharge under § 682.402(e)(1)(i)(C), but is nonetheless unenforceable, the lender must—

      (A) Notify the consumer reporting agency of its determination; and

      (B) Comply with §§ 682.300(b)(2)(ix) and 682.302(d)(1)(viii).

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (4) If, within 3 years of the lender's receipt of an identity theft report, the lender receives from the borrower evidence specified in § 682.402(e)(3)(v), the lender may submit a claim and receive interest subsidy and special allowance payments that would have accrued on the loan.

      (c)(1) A lender shall respond within 30 days after receipt to any inquiry from a borrower or any endorser on a loan.

      (2) When a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower or a student PLUS loan borrower is no longer enrolled at an institution of higher education on at least a half-time basis, the lender shall promptly contact the borrower in order to establish the terms of repayment.

      (3)(i) If the borrower disputes the terms of the loan in writing and the lender does not resolve the dispute, the lender's response must provide the borrower with an appropriate contact at the guaranty agency for the resolution of the dispute.

      (ii) If the guaranty agency does not resolve the dispute, the agency's response must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.

      (d) Subject to the rules regarding maximum duration of a repayment period and minimum annual payment described in § 682.209(a)(7), (c), and (h), nothing in this part is intended to limit a lender's discretion in establishing, or, with the borrower's consent, revising a borrower's repayment schedule—

      (1) To provide for graduated or income-sensitive repayment terms. The Secretary strongly encourages lenders to provide a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a borrower providing for at least the payment of interest charges, unless the borrower requests otherwise, in order to make the borrower's repayment burden commensurate with his or her projected ability to pay; or

      (2) To provide a single repayment schedule, as authorized and if practicable, for all FFEL program loans to the borrower held by the lender.

      (e)(1) If the assignment or transfer of ownership interest of a Stafford, PLUS, SLS, or Consolidation loan is to result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower must send subsequent payments, the assignor and assignee of the loan shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the assigned loan, provide, either jointly or separately, a notice to the borrower of—

      (i) The assignment;

      (ii) The identity of the assignee;

      (iii) The name and address of the party to whom subsequent payments or communications must be sent;

      (iv) The telephone numbers of both the assignor and the assignee;

      (v) The effective date of the assignment or transfer of the loan;

      (vi) The date, if applicable, on which the current loan servicer will stop accepting payments; and

      (vii) The date on which the new loan servicer will begin accepting payments.

      (2) If the assignor and assignee separately provide the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each notice must indicate that a corresponding notice will be sent by the other party to the assignment.

      (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “assigned” is defined in § 682.401(b)(8)(ii).

      (4) The assignee, or the assignor on behalf of the assignee, shall notify the guaranty agency that guaranteed the loan within 45 days of the date the assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the loan of—

      (i) The assignment; and

      (ii) The name and address of the assignee, and the telephone number of the assignee that can be used to obtain information about the repayment of the loan.

      (5) The requirements of this paragraph (e), as to borrower notification, apply if the borrower is in a grace period or has entered the repayment period.

      (f)(1) Notwithstanding an error by the school or lender, a lender shall follow the procedures in § 682.412 whenever it receives information that can be substantiated that the borrower, or the student on whose behalf a parent has borrowed, has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance, provided false or erroneous information or took actions that caused the student or borrower—

      (i) To be ineligible for all or a portion of a loan made under this part;

      (ii) To receive a Stafford loan subject to payment of Federal interest benefits as provided under § 682.301, for which he or she was ineligible; or

      (iii) To receive loan proceeds that were not paid to the school or repaid to the lender by or on behalf of a registered student who—

      (A) The school notifies the lender under 34 CFR 668.21(a)(2)(ii) has withdrawn or been expelled prior to the first day of classes for the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended; or

      (B) Failed to attend school during that period.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the term “guaranty agency” in § 682.412(e) refers to the Secretary in the case of a Federal GSL loan.

      (g) If, during a period when the borrower is not delinquent, a lender receives information indicating it does not know the borrower's address, it may commence the skip-tracing activities specified in § 682.411(h).

      (h)  If an FFEL Program loan has not been assigned, but there is a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower must send subsequent payments or direct any communications concerning the loan, the holder of the loan shall, no later than 45 days after the date of the change, provide notice to the borrower of the name, telephone number, and address of the party to whom subsequent payments or communications must be sent. The requirements of this paragraph apply if the borrower is in a grace period or has entered the repayment period.

      (i) A lender shall report enrollment and loan status information, or any Title IV loan-related data required by the Secretary, to the guaranty agency or to the Secretary, as applicable, by the deadline date established by the Secretary.

      (j)(1) Effective July 1, 2016, a loan holder is required to use the official electronic database maintained by the Department of Defense, to—

      (i) Identify all borrowers who are military servicemembers and who are eligible under § 682.202(a)(8); and

      (ii) Confirm the dates of the borrower's military service status and begin, extend, or end, as applicable, the use of the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent.

      (2) The loan holder must compare its list of borrowers against the database maintained by the Department of Defense at least monthly to identify servicemembers who are in military service status for the purpose of determining eligibility under § 682.202(a)(8).

      (3) A borrower may provide the loan holder with alternative evidence of military service status to demonstrate eligibility if the borrower believes that the information contained in the Department of Defense database is inaccurate or incomplete. Acceptable alternative evidence includes—

      (i) A copy of the borrower's military orders; or

      (ii) The certification of the borrower's military service from an authorized official using a form approved by the Secretary.

      (4)(i) When the loan holder determines that the borrower is eligible under § 682.202(a)(8), the loan holder must ensure the interest rate on the borrower's loan does not exceed the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent.

      (ii) The loan holder must apply the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent for the longest eligible period verified with the official electronic database, or alternative evidence of military service status received under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, using the combination of evidence that provides the borrower with the earliest military service start date and the latest military service end date.

      (iii) In the case of a reservist, the loan holder must use the reservist's notification date as the start date of the military service period.

      (5) When the loan holder applies the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent to a borrower's loan, it must notify the borrower in writing within 30 days that the interest rate on the loan has been reduced to six percent during the borrower's period of military service.

      (6)(i) For PLUS loans with an endorser, the loan holder must use the official electronic database to begin, extend, or end, as applicable, the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent on the loan based on the borrower's or endorser's military service status, regardless of whether the loan holder is currently pursuing the endorser for repayment of the loan.

      (ii) If both the borrower and the endorser are eligible for the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent on a loan, the loan holder must use the earliest military service start date of either party and the latest military service end date of either party to begin, extend, or end, as applicable, the SCRA interest rate limit.

      (7)(i) For joint consolidation loans, the loan holder must use the official electronic database to begin, extend, or end, as applicable, the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent on the loan if either of the borrowers is eligible for the SCRA interest rate limit under § 682.202(a)(8).

      (ii) If both borrowers on a joint consolidation loan are eligible for the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent on a loan, the loan holder must use the earliest military service start date of either party and the latest military service end date of either party to begin, extend, or end, as applicable, the SCRA interest rate limit.

      (8) If the application of the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent results in an overpayment on a loan that is subsequently paid in full through consolidation, the underlying loan holder must return the overpayment to the holder of the consolidation loan.

      (9) For any other circumstances where application of the SCRA interest rate limit of six percent results in an overpayment of the remaining balance on the loan, the loan holder must refund the amount of that overpayment to the borrower.

      (10) For purposes of this section, the term “military service” means—

      (i) In the case of a servicemember who is a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard—

      (A) Active duty, meaning full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Such term includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Such term does not include full-time National Guard duty.

      (B) In the case of a member of the National Guard, including service under a call to active service, which means service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty, authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds;

      (ii) In the case of a servicemember who is a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, active service; and

      (2)(i) For a PLUS loan, the repayment period begins on the date of the last disbursement made on the loan. Interest accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first disbursement of the loan. The first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully disbursed.

      (ii) For an SLS loan, the repayment period begins on the date the loan is disbursed, or, if the loan is disbursed in multiple installments, on the date of the last disbursement of the loan.

      (iii) For an SLS borrower who has not yet entered repayment on a Stafford loan, the borrower may postpone payment, consistent with the grace period on the borrower's Stafford loan.

      (iv) If the lender first learns after the fact that an SLS borrower has entered the repayment period, the repayment begins no later than 75 days after the date the lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period.

      (v) The lender may establish a first payment due date that is no more than an additional 30 days beyond the period specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)-(a)(2)(iv) of this section in order for the lender to comply with the required deadline contained in § 682.205(c)(1).

      (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, for a Stafford loan the repayment period begins—

      (A) For a borrower with a loan for which the applicable interest rate is 7 percent per year, not less than 9 nor more than 12 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an eligible school. The length of this grace period is determined by the lender for loans made under the FISL Program, and by the guaranty agency for loans guaranteed by the agency;

      (B) For a borrower with a loan for which the initial applicable interest rate is 8 or 9 percent per year, the day after 6 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an institution of higher education;

      (C) For a borrower with a loan with a variable interest rate, the day after 6 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an institution of higher education; and

      (D) For a borrower with a loan for which the applicable interest rate is fixed at 6.0 percent per year, 5.6 percent per year, or 6.8 percent per year, the day after 6 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an institution of higher education.

      (ii) The first payment on a Stafford loan is due on a date established by the lender that is no more than—

      (A) 60 days following the first day that the repayment period begins;

      (B) 60 days from the expiration of a deferment or forbearance period;

      (C) 60 days following the end of the post deferment grace period;

      (D) If the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has entered the repayment period, no later than 75 days after the date the lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period; or

      (E) An additional 30 days beyond the periods specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)-(a)(3)(ii)(D) of this section in order for the lender to comply with the required deadlines contained in § 682.205(a)(1).

      (iii) When determining the date that the student was no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the lender must use a new date it receives from a school, unless the lender has already disclosed repayment terms to the borrower and the new date is within the same month and year as the most recent date reported to the lender.

      (4) For a borrower of a Stafford loan who is a correspondence student, the grace period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section begins on the earliest of—

      (i) The day after the borrower completes the program;

      (ii) The day after withdrawal as determined pursuant to 34 CFR 668.22; or

      (iii) 60 days following the last day for completing the program as established by the school.

      (5) For purposes of establishing the beginning of the repayment period for Stafford and SLS loans, the grace periods referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (a)(3)(i) of this section exclude any period during which a borrower who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title 10, United States Code is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days. Any single excluded period may not exceed three years and includes the time necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available regular enrollment period. Any Stafford or SLS borrower who is in a grace period when called or ordered to active duty as specified in this paragraph is entitled to a full grace period upon completion of the excluded period.

      (6)(i) The repayment schedule may provide for substantially equal installment payments or for installment payments that increase or decrease in amount during the repayment period. If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that—

      (A) Provides for adjustments of the amount of the installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate; or

      (B) Contains no provision for an adjustment of the amount of the installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate, but requires the lender to grant a forbearance to the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 3 years of payments in accordance with § 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of a variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term.

      (ii) If a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule is established, it may not provide for any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's first payment is due, the lender must offer the borrower a choice of a standard, income-sensitive, income-based, graduated, or, if applicable, an extended repayment schedule.

      (iv) Except in the case of an income-based repayment schedule, the repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at least the interest that accrues during the interval between scheduled payments.

      (v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a standard repayment schedule described in paragraph (a)(6)(vi) of this section if the borrower—

      (A) Does not select an income-sensitive, income-based, graduated, or, if applicable, an extended repayment schedule within 45 days after being notified by the lender to choose a repayment schedule;

      (B) Chooses an income-sensitive repayment schedule, but does not provide the documentation requested by the lender under paragraph (a)(6)(viii)(C) of this section within the time period specified by the lender; or

      (C) Chooses an income-based repayment schedule, but does not provide the income documentation requested by the lender under § 682.215(e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) within the time period specified by the lender.

      (vi) Under a standard repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled to pay either—

      (A) The same amount for each installment payment made during the repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be slightly more or less than the other payments; or

      (B) An installment amount that will be adjusted to reflect annual changes in the loan's variable interest rate.

      (vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule—

      (A)() The amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled to change (usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment period; or

      () If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section; and

      (B) An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (viii) Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule—

      (A)() The amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted annually, based on the borrower's expected total monthly gross income received by the borrower from employment and from other sources during the course of the repayment period; or

      () If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section; and

      (B) In general, the lender shall request the borrower to inform the lender of his or her income no earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The income information must be sufficient for the lender to make a reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should be. If the lender receives late notification that the borrower has dropped below half-time enrollment status at a school, the lender may request that income information earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment;

      (C) If the borrower reports income to the lender that the lender considers to be insufficient for establishing monthly installment payments that would repay the loan within the applicable maximum repayment period, the lender shall require the borrower to submit evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly gross income received by the borrower from employment and from other sources including, if applicable, pay statements from employers and documentation of any income received by the borrower from other parties;

      (D) The lender shall grant a forbearance to the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 5 years of payments in accordance with § 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term; and

      (E) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

      (ix) Under an extended repayment schedule, a new borrower whose total outstanding principal and interest in FFEL loans exceed $30,000 may repay the loan on a fixed annual repayment amount or a graduated repayment amount for a period that may not exceed 25 years. For purposes of this section, a “new borrower” is an individual who has no outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of October 7, 1998, or on the date he or she obtains an FFEL Program loan after October 7, 1998.

      (x) Under an income-based repayment schedule, the borrower repays the loan in accordance with § 682.215.

      (xi) A borrower may request a change in the repayment schedule on a loan. The lender must permit the borrower to change the repayment schedule no less frequently than annually, or at any time in the case of a borrower in an income-based repayment plan.

      (xii) For purposes of this section, a lender shall, to the extent practicable require that all FFEL loans owed by a borrower to the lender be combined into one account and repaid under one repayment schedule. In that event, the word “loan” in this section shall mean all of the borrower's loans that were combined by the lender into that account.

      (7)(i) Subject to paragraphs (a)(7)(ii) through (iv) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ix) a lender shall allow a borrower at least 5 years, but not more than 10 years, or 25 years under an extended repayment plan to repay a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. Except in the case of a FISL loan for a period of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1986, the lender shall require a borrower to fully repay a FISL loan within 15 years after it is made.

      (ii) If the borrower receives an authorized deferment or is granted forbearance, as described in § 682.210 or § 682.211 respectively, the periods of deferment or forbearance are excluded from determinations of the 5-, 10-, and 15- and 25-year periods, and from the 10-, 12-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year periods for repayment of a Consolidation loan pursuant to § 682.209(h).

      (iii) If the minimum annual repayment required in paragraph (c) of this section would result in complete repayment of the loan in less than 5 years, the borrower is not entitled to the full 5-year period.

      (iv) The borrower may, prior to the beginning of the repayment period, request and be granted by the lender a repayment period of less than 5 years. Subject to paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, a borrower who makes such a request may notify the lender at any time to extend the repayment period to a minimum of 5 years.

      (8) If, with respect to the aggregate of all loans held by a lender, the total payment made by a borrower for a monthly or similar payment period would not otherwise be a multiple of five dollars, except in the case of payments made under an income-based repayment plan, the lender may round that periodic payment to the next highest whole dollar amount that is a multiple of five dollars.

      (b)  (1) Except in the case of payments made under an income-based repayment plan, the lender may credit the entire payment amount first to any late charges accrued or collection costs and then to any outstanding interest and then to outstanding principal.

      (2)(i) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at any time without penalty.

      (ii) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds the monthly payment amount under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the lender shall apply the prepayment to future installments by advancing the next payment due date, unless the borrower requests otherwise. The lender must either inform the borrower in advance using a prominent statement in the borrower's coupon book or billing statement that any additional full payment amounts submitted without instructions to the lender as to their handling will be applied to future scheduled payments with the borrower's next scheduled payment due date advanced consistent with the number of additional payments received, or provide a notification to the borrower after the payments are received informing the borrower that the payments have been so applied and the date of the borrower's next scheduled payment due date. Information related to next scheduled payment due date need not be provided to borrowers making such prepayments while in an in-school, grace, deferment, or forbearance period when payments are not due.

      (c)  (1)(i) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and except as otherwise provided by a graduated, income-sensitive, extended, or income-based repayment plan selected by the borrower, during each year of the repayment period, a borrower's total payments to all holders of the borrower's FFEL Program loans must total at least $600 or the unpaid balance of all loans, including interest, whichever amount is less.

      (ii) If the borrower and the lender agree, the amount paid may be less.

      (2) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section may not result in an extension of the maximum repayment period unless forbearance as described in § 682.211, or deferment described in § 682.210, has been approved.

      (d)  (1) A lender may, at the request of a student borrower, combine the borrower's, student PLUS and SLS loans held by it into a single repayment schedule.

      (2) The repayment period on the loans included in the combined repayment schedule must be calculated based on the beginning of repayment of the most recent included loan.

      (3) The interest rate on the loans included in the new combined repayment schedule must be the weighted average of the rates of all included loans.

      (e)  (1) For a Consolidation loan, the repayment period begins on the day of disbursement, with the first payment due within 60 days after the date of disbursement.

      (2) If the sum of the amount of the Consolidation loan and the unpaid balance on other student loans to the applicant—

      (i) Is less than $7,500, the borrower shall repay the Consolidation loan in not more than 10 years;

      (ii) Is equal to or greater than $7,500 but less than $10,000, the borrower shall repay the Consolidation loan in not more than 12 years;

      (iii) Is equal to or greater than $10,000 but less than $20,000, the borrower shall repay the Consolidation loan in not more than 15 years;

      § 682.210   Deferment.

#### § § 682.210

      (a)  (1)(i) A borrower is entitled to have periodic installment payments of principal deferred during authorized periods after the beginning of the repayment period, pursuant to paragraph (b) and paragraphs (s) through (v) of this section.

      (ii) With the exception of a deferment authorized under paragraph (o) of this section, a borrower may continue to receive a specific type of deferment that is limited to a maximum period of time only if the total amount of time that the borrower has received the deferment does not exceed the maximum time period allowed for the deferment.

      (2)(i) For a loan made before October 1, 1981, the borrower is also entitled to have periodic installments of principal deferred during the six-month period (post-deferment grace period) that begins after the completion of each deferment period or combination of those periods, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (ii) Once a borrower receives a post-deferment grace period following an unemployment deferment, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the borrower does not qualify for additional post-deferment grace periods following subsequent unemployment deferments.

      (3)(i) Interest accrues and is paid by—

      (A) The Secretary during the deferment period for a subsidized Stafford loan and for all or a portion of a Consolidation loan that qualifies for interest benefits under § 682.301; or

      (B) The borrower during the deferment period and, as applicable, the post-deferment grace period, on all other loans.

      (ii) A borrower who is responsible for payment of interest during a deferment period must be notified by the lender, at or before the time the deferment is granted, that the borrower has the option to pay the accruing interest or cancel the deferment and continue paying on the loan. The lender must also provide information, including an example, on the impact of capitalization of accrued, unpaid interest on loan principal, and on the total amount of interest to be paid over the life of the loan.

      (4) As a condition for receiving a deferment, except for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, the borrower, or the borrower's representative for purposes of paragraphs (i) and (t) of this section, must request the deferment, and provide the lender with all information and documents required to establish eligibility for a specific type of deferment.

      (5) An authorized deferment period begins on the date that the holder determines is the date that the condition entitling the borrower to the deferment first existed, except that an initial unemployment deferment as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section cannot begin more than 6 months before the date the holder receives a request and documentation required for the deferment.

      (6) An authorized deferment period ends on the earlier of—

      (i) The date when the condition establishing the borrower's eligibility for the deferment ends;

      (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the date on which, as certified by an authorized official, the borrower's eligibility for the deferment is expected to end;

      (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the expiration date of the period covered by any certification required by this section to be obtained for the deferment;

      (iv) In the case of an in-school deferment, the student's anticipated graduation date as certified by an authorized official of the school; or

      (v) The date when the condition providing the basis for the borrower's eligibility for the deferment has continued to exist for the maximum amount of time allowed for that type of deferment.

      (7) A lender may not deny a borrower a deferment to which the borrower is entitled, even though the borrower may be delinquent, but not in default, in making required installment payments. The 270- or 330-day period required to establish default does not run during the deferment and post-deferment grace periods. Unless the lender has granted the borrower forbearance under § 682.211, when the deferment and, if applicable, the post-deferment grace period expire, a borrower resumes any delinquency status that existed when the deferment period began.

      (8) A borrower whose loan is in default is not eligible for a deferment on that loan, unless the borrower has made payment arrangements acceptable to the lender prior to the payment of a default claim by a guaranty agency.

      (9) The borrower promptly must inform the lender when the condition entitling the borrower to a deferment no longer exists.

      (10) Authorized deferments are described in paragraph (b) of this section. Specific requirements for each deferment are set forth in paragraphs (c) through (s) of this section.

      (11) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender shall grant a request for deferment if both individuals simultaneously meet the requirements of this section for receiving the same, or different deferments.

      (4) In the case of a FFEL borrower, the lender shall treat a certified loan application or other form certified by the school or for multiple holders of a borrower's loans, shared data from the Student Status Confirmation Report, as sufficient documentation for an in-school student deferment for any outstanding FFEL loan previously made to the borrower that is held by the lender.

To continue to receive the deferment in a subsequent year under this paragraph, the borrower shall provide the lender with a statement by the chief administrative officer of the public or nonprofit private elementary or secondary school that employs the borrower, certifying that the borrower continues to be employed as a full-time teacher in the same teacher shortage area for which the deferment was received for the previous year.

      (5) For purposes of this section a teacher shortage area is—

      (i)(A) A geographic region of the State in which there is a shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers; or

      (B) A specific grade level or academic, instructional, subject-matter, or discipline classification in which there is a statewide shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers; and

      (ii) Designated by the Secretary under paragraphs (q)(6) or (q)(7) of this section.

      (6)(i) In order for the Secretary to designate one or more teacher shortage areas in a State for a school year, the Chief State School Officer shall by January 1 of the calendar year in which the school year begins, and in accordance with objective written standards, propose teacher shortage areas to the Secretary for designation. With respect to private nonprofit schools included in the recommendation, the Chief State School Officer shall consult with appropriate officials of the private nonprofit schools in the State prior to submitting the recommendation.

      (ii) In identifying teacher shortage areas to propose for designation under paragraph (q)(6)(i) of this section, the Chief State School Officer shall consider data from the school year in which the recommendation is to be made, unless that data is not yet available, in which case he or she may use data from the immediately preceding school year, with respect to—

      (A) Teaching positions that are unfilled;

      (B) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are certified by irregular, provisional, temporary, or emergency certification; and

      (C) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are certified, but who are teaching in academic subject areas other than their area of preparation.

      (iii) If the total number of unduplicated full-time equivalent (FTE) elementary or secondary teaching positions identified under paragraph (q)(6)(ii) of this section in the shortage areas proposed by the State for designation does not exceed 5 percent of the total number of FTE elementary and secondary teaching positions in the State, the Secretary designates those areas as teacher shortage areas.

      (iv) If the total number of unduplicated FTE elementary and secondary teaching positions identified under paragraph (q)(6)(ii) of this section in the shortage areas proposed by the State for designation exceeds 5 percent of the total number of elementary and secondary FTE teaching positions in the State, the Chief State School Officer shall submit, with the list of proposed areas, supporting documentation showing the methods used for identifying shortage areas, and an explanation of the reasons why the Secretary should nevertheless designate all of the proposed areas as teacher shortage areas. The explanation must include a ranking of the proposed shortage areas according to priority, to assist the Secretary in determining which areas should be designated. The Secretary, after considering the explanation, determines which shortage areas to designate as teacher shortage areas.

      (7) A Chief State School Officer may submit to the Secretary for approval an alternative written procedure to the one described in paragraph (q)(6) of this section, for the Chief State School Officer to use to select the teacher shortage areas recommended to the Secretary for designation, and for the Secretary to use to choose the areas to be designated. If the Secretary approves the proposed alternative procedure, in writing, that procedure, once approved, may be used instead of the procedure described in paragraph (q)(6) of this section for designation of teacher shortage areas in that State.

      (8) For purposes of paragraphs (q)(1) through (7) of this section—

      (i) The definition of the term  in § 682.200(b) does not apply;

      (ii)  means a day or residential school that provides elementary education, as determined under State law;

      (iii)  means a day or residential school that provides secondary education, as determined under State law. In the absence of applicable State law, the Secretary may determine, with respect to that State, whether the term “secondary school” includes education beyond the twelfth grade;

      (viii)  means the standard used by a State in defining full-time employment, but not less than 30 hours per week. For purposes of counting full-time equivalent teacher positions, a teacher working part of his or her total hours in a position that is designated as a teacher shortage area is counted on a  basis corresponding to the percentage of his or her working hours spent in such a position.

      (r)  (1) To qualify for the working-mother deferment described in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the borrower shall provide the lender with a statement certifying that she—

      (iii) After receiving a borrower's written or verbal request, a lender may grant a deferment under paragraphs (s)(3) through (s)(6) of this section if the lender is able to confirm that the borrower has received a deferment on another FFEL loan or on a Direct Loan for the same reason and the same time period. The lender may grant the deferment based on information from the other FFEL loan holder or the Secretary or from an authoritative electronic database maintained or authorized by the Secretary that supports eligibility for the deferment for the same reason and the same time period.

      (iv) A lender may rely in good faith on the information it receives under paragraph (s)(1)(iii) of this section when determining a borrower's eligibility for a deferment unless the lender, as of the date of the determination, has information indicating that the borrower does not qualify for the deferment. A lender must resolve any discrepant information before granting a deferment under paragraph (s)(1)(iii) of this section.

      (v) A lender that grants a deferment under paragraph (s)(1)(iii) of this section must notify the borrower that the deferment has been granted and that the borrower has the option to pay interest that accrues on an unsubsidized FFEL loan or to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan.

      (h) —(1)  Upon receipt of a request and sufficient supporting documentation, as described in § 682.210(n), from a borrower serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program, a lender shall grant forbearance to the borrower in yearly increments (or a lesser period equal to the actual period during which the borrower is eligible) if the borrower has exhausted his or her eligibility for a deferment under § 682.210(n), or the borrower's promissory note does not provide for such a deferment—

      (i) For the length of time remaining in the borrower's medical or dental internship or residency that must be successfully completed before the borrower may begin professional practice or service; or

      (ii) For the length of time that the borrower is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training.

      (2)  Upon receipt of a request and sufficient supporting documentation from an endorser (if applicable), or from a borrower (other than a borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section), a lender shall grant forbearance—

      (i) In increments up to one year, for periods that collectively do not exceed three years, if—

      (A) The borrower or endorser is currently obligated to make payments on Title IV loans; and

      (B) The amount of those payments each month (or a proportional share if the payments are due less frequently than monthly) is collectively equal to or greater than 20 percent of the borrower's or endorser's total monthly income;

      (ii) In yearly increments (or a lesser period equal to the actual period during which the borrower is eligible) for as long as a borrower—

      (A) Is serving in a national service position for which the borrower receives a national service educational award under the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993;

      (B) Is performing the type of service that would qualify the borrower for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student Loan Repayment Programs administered by the Department of Defense under 10 U.S.C. 2171, 2173, 2174 or any other student loan repayment programs administered by the Department of Defense; or

      (C) Is performing the type of service that would qualify the borrower for loan forgiveness and associated forbearance under the requirements of the teacher loan forgiveness program in § 682.216; and

      (iii) In yearly increments (or a lesser period equal to the actual period for which the borrower is eligible) when a member of the National Guard who qualifies for a post-active duty student deferment, but does not qualify for a military service deferment or other deferment, is engaged in active State duty as defined in § 682.210(u)(2)(i) and (ii) for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, beginning—

      (4)  (i) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower or endorser under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, the lender shall require the borrower or endorser to submit at least the following documentation:

      (A) Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly gross income received by the borrower or endorser from employment and from other sources; and

      (B) Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the borrower or endorser to other entities for the most recent month for the borrower's or endorser's Title IV loans.

      (ii) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower or endorser under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the lender shall require the borrower or endorser to submit documentation showing the beginning and ending dates that the Department of Defense considers the borrower to be eligible for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student Loan Repayment Programs.

      (iii) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the lender must require the borrower to—

      (A) Submit documentation for the period of the annual forbearance request showing the beginning and anticipated ending dates that the borrower is expected to perform, for that year, the type of service described in § 682.216(c); and

      (B) Certify the borrower's intent to satisfy the requirements of § 682.216(c).

      (i)  (1) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance for the periods specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section until the lender is notified by the Secretary or a guaranty agency that the forbearance period no longer applies. The lender may not require a borrower who is eligible for a forbearance under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section to submit a request or supporting documentation, but shall require a borrower (or endorser, if applicable) who requests forbearance because of a military mobilization to provide documentation showing that he or she is subject to a military mobilization as described in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.

      (2) The lender is not required to notify the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) at the time the forbearance is granted, but shall grant a forbearance to a borrower or endorser during a period, and the 30 days following the period, when the lender is notified by the Secretary that—

      (i) Exceptional circumstances exist, such as a local or national emergency or military mobilization; or

      (i) May decline the forbearance and continue to be obligated to make scheduled payments; or

      (ii) Consents to making payments in accordance with the lender's notification if the forbearance is not declined.

      (4) For purposes of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, the term “military mobilization” shall mean a situation in which the Department of Defense orders members of the National Guard or Reserves to active duty under sections 688, 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, and 12306 of title 10, United States Code. This term also includes the assignment of other members of the Armed Forces to duty stations at locations other than the locations at which they were normally assigned, only if the military mobilization involved the activation of the National Guard or Reserves.

      (5) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to a borrower (or endorser, if applicable) during a period when the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) is making payments for a period of—

      (i) Up to 3 years of payments in cases where the effect of a variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term; or

      (ii) Up to 5 years of payments in cases where the effect of decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment schedule would result in the loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term.

      (6) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to a borrower for a period not to exceed 60 days after the lender receives reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student in the case of a PLUS loan) has died, until the lender receives documentation of death pursuant to § 682.402(b)(3).

      § 682.214   [Reserved]

#### § § 682.214

      § 682.215   Income-based repayment plan.

#### § § 682.215

      (a)  As used in this section—

      (1)  (AGI) means the borrower's adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For a married borrower filing jointly, AGI includes both the borrower's and spouse's income. For a married borrower filing separately, AGI includes only the borrower's income.

      (2)  means any outstanding loan made to a borrower under the FFEL and Direct Loan programs except for a defaulted loan, a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, or a FFEL or Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower.

      (3)  means the number of individuals that is determined by adding together—

      (i) The borrower;

      (ii) The borrower's spouse, for a married borrower filing a joint Federal income tax return;

      (iii) The borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower and are not included in the family size for any other borrower except the borrower's spouse who filed jointly with the borrower; and

      (iv) Other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals live with the borrower and receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year for which the borrower certifies family size.

      (4)  means a circumstance in which—

      (i) For an unmarried borrower or a married borrower who files an individual Federal tax return, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent of the difference between the borrower's AGI and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size; or

      (ii) For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans and, if applicable, the spouse's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the loans initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower or spouse elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent of the difference between the borrower's and spouse's AGI, and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size.

      (5)  refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.

      (b)  (1) A borrower may elect the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty line income applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12. The loan holder adjusts the calculated monthly payment if—

      (i) Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the total amount of the borrower's eligible loans includes loans not held by the loan holder, in which case the loan holder determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are held by the loan holder;

      (ii) Both the borrower and the borrower's spouse have eligible loans and filed a joint Federal tax return, in which case the loan holder determines—

      (A) Each borrower's percentage of the couple's total eligible loan debt;

      (B) The adjusted monthly payment for each borrower by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and

      (C) If the borrower's loans are held by multiple holders, the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the payment determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are held by the loan holder;

      (iii) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(1)(i), or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is less than $5.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $0.00; or

      (iv) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(1)(i), or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is equal to or greater than $5.00 but less than $10.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $10.00.

      (2) A borrower with eligible loans held by two or more loan holders must request income-based repayment from each loan holder if the borrower wants to repay all of his or her eligible loans under the income-based repayment plan. Each loan holder must apply the payment calculation rules in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section to loans they hold.

      (3) If a borrower elects the income-based repayment plan on or after July 1, 2013, the loan holder must, unless the borrower has some loans that are eligible for repayment under the income-based repayment plan and other loans that are not eligible for repayment under that plan, require that all eligible loans owed by the borrower to that holder be repaid under the income-based repayment plan.

      (4) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's subsidized Stafford Loans or the subsidized portion of the borrower's Federal Consolidation loan, the Secretary pays to the holder the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on each loan repaid under the income-based repayment plan. On a Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has paid accrued interest under this section, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary paid accrued interest on the underlying loans. The three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.

      (5) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized at the time the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.

      (6) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.

      (7) The special allowance payment to a lender during the period in which the borrower has a partial financial hardship under the income-based repayment plan is calculated on the principal balance of the loan and any accrued interest unpaid by the borrower.

      (8) The repayment period for a borrower under the income-based repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.

      (c)  (1) The loan holder shall apply any payment made under the income-based repayment plan in the following order:

      (i) Accrued interest.

      (ii) Collection costs.

      (iii) Late charges.

      (iv) Loan principal.

      (2) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at any time without penalty.

      (3) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds a monthly payment amount of $10.00 or more under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the loan holder shall apply the prepayment consistent with the requirements of § 682.209(b)(2)(ii).

      (4) If the prepayment amount exceeds the monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the loan holder shall apply the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (d)  (1) If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the income-based repayment plan but the loan holder must recalculate the borrower's monthly payment. The loan holder also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as a result of the recalculation—

      (i) The maximum monthly amount that the loan holder requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the FFEL standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans with that holder under the income-based repayment plan; and

      (ii) The borrower's repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years.

      (2) If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the FFEL standard repayment plan and the loan holder recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on—

      (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the time remaining under the maximum 10-year repayment period and the amount of the borrower's loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan; or

      (ii) For a Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under § 682.209(h)(2) and the total amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan.

      (3) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan and who is required to repay under the FFEL standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the FFEL standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with § 682.211(a)(1).

      (e)  (1) The loan holder determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower elects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the loan holder requires the borrower to—

      (i) Provide documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the borrower's AGI;

      (ii) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or the loan holder believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, provide other documentation to verify income;

      (iii) If the spouse of a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return has eligible loans and the loan holder does not hold at least one of the spouse's eligible loans—

      (A) Ensure that the borrower's spouse has provided consent for the loan holder to obtain information about the spouse's eligible loans from the National Student Loan Data System; or

      (B) Provide other documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the spouse's eligible loan information; and

      (iv) Annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the loan holder must assume a family size of one for that year.

      (2) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—

      (i) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);

      (ii) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the loan holder must receive this information;

      (iii) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;

      (iv) An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and

      (v) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the loan holder recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the loan holder recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

      (3) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the loan holder must notify the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification must provide the borrower with—

      (i) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the loan holder must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and

      (ii) The consequences if the loan holder does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

      (4) Each time a loan holder makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—

      (i) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

      (ii) An explanation that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and

      (iii) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the loan holder redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the loan holder determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the loan holder must recalculate the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.

      (5) For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.

      (6) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the income-based repayment plan but does not provide the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section, or if the loan holder determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.

      (7) The loan holder designates the repayment option described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the income-based repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the loan holder does not receive the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, unless the loan holder is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.

      (8) If the loan holder receives the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline—

      (i) The loan holder must promptly determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount.

      (ii) If the loan holder does not determine the new monthly payment amount by the end of the borrower's current annual payment period, the loan holder must prevent the borrower's monthly payment amount from being recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section and maintain the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the loan holder determines the new monthly payment amount.

      (A) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, the loan holder must make the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account to reflect any payments at the previously calculated amount that the borrower made after the end of the most recent annual payment period. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 682.209(b)(2)(ii), unless the borrower requests otherwise the loan holder applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (B) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, the loan holder does not make any adjustments to the borrower's account.

      (iii) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.

      (9) If the loan holder receives the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the loan holder may grant forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated income-based monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount.

No later than six months prior to the anticipated date that the borrower will meet the loan forgiveness requirements, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notice that includes—

      (ii) If the forgiveness amount exceeds the outstanding balance on the eligible loans subject to forgiveness, the loan holder must refund the excess amount to the guaranty agency.

      (7) If the guaranty agency does not pay the forgiveness claim, the lender will continue the borrower in repayment on the loan. The lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance of both principal and interest from the date the borrower's repayment obligation was suspended until a new payment due date is established. Unless the denial of the forgiveness claim was due to an error by the lender, the lender may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during this period, in accordance with § 682.202(b).

      (8) The loan holder must promptly return to the sender any payment received on a loan after the guaranty agency pays the loan holder the amount of loan forgiveness.

      (ii) For a period not to exceed 60 days while the holder is awaiting a completed teacher loan forgiveness application from the borrower; and

      (iii) For the period beginning on the date the holder receives a completed loan forgiveness application to the date the holder receives either a denial of the request or the loan forgiveness amount from the guaranty agency, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (2) At the conclusion of a forbearance authorized under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the holder must resume collection activities and may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during the forbearance period in accordance with § 682.202(b).

      (iii) If the holder files a request for payment later than 60 days after the receipt of the completed teacher loan forgiveness application form, interest that accrued on the loan forgiveness amount after the expiration of the 60-day filing period is ineligible for reimbursement by the Secretary, and the holder must repay all interest and special allowance received on the loan forgiveness amount for periods after the expiration of the 60-day filing period. The holder cannot collect from the borrower any interest that is not paid by the Secretary under this paragraph.

      (3)(i) Within 45 days of receiving the holder's request for payment, the guaranty agency must determine if the borrower meets the eligibility requirements for loan forgiveness under this section and must notify the holder of its determination of the borrower's eligibility for loan forgiveness under this section.

      (ii) If the guaranty agency approves the loan forgiveness, it must, within the same 45-day period, pay the holder the amount of the laon forgiveness, up to $17,500, subject to paragraphs (c)(11), (d)(1), (d)(2) and (f)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (4) After being notified by the guaranty agency of its determination of the eligibility of the borrower for the loan forgiveness, the holder must, within 30 days, inform the borrower of the determination. If the loan forgiveness is approved, the holder must also provide the borrower with information regarding any new repayment terms of remaining loan balances.

      (5) Unless otherwise instructed by the borrower, the holder must apply the proceeds of the teacher forgiveness first to any outstanding unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan balances, next to any outstanding subsidized Federal Stafford loan balances, then to any eligible outstanding Federal Consolidation loan balances.

      (g)  In the case of a teacher loan forgiveness applied to a defaulted loan held by the guaranty agency, the Secretary pays the guaranty agency a percentage of the amount forgiven that is equal to the complement of the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan. The payment of up to $5,000, or up to $17,500, may also include interest that accrues on the forgiveness amount during the period from the date on which the guaranty agency received payment from the Secretary on a default claim to the date on which the guaranty agency determines that the borrower is eligible for the teacher loan forgiveness.

      § 682.303   [Reserved]

#### § § 682.303

      § 682.304   Methods for computing interest benefits and special allowance.

#### § § 682.304

      (a)  The Secretary pays a lender interest benefits and special allowance on eligible loans on a quarterly basis. These calendar quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. A lender may use either the average daily balance method or the actual accrual method to determine the amount of interest benefits payable on a lender's loans. A lender shall use the average daily balance method to determine the balance on which the Secretary computes the amount of special allowance payable on its loans.

      (b)  (1) Under this method, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on all loans qualifying for interest benefits at each actual interest rate for each day of the quarter, divides the sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for qualified loans outstanding at each actual interest rate.

      (2) The Secretary computes the interest benefits due on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate by multiplying the average daily balance thereof by the actual interest rate, multiplying this result by the number of days in the quarter, and then dividing this result by the actual number of days in the year.

      (c)  (1) Under this method, the lender computes the total unpaid principal balance outstanding on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate on each day of the quarter, multiplies this result by the actual interest rate, and divides this result by the actual number of days in the year, or, alternatively, 365.25 days. A lender who chooses to divide by 365.25 days must do so for four consecutive years.

      (2) The interest benefits due for a quarter equal the sum of the daily interest benefits due, computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each day of the quarter.

      (d)  (1) To compute the average daily balance outstanding for purposes of special allowance, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on all qualified loans at each applicable interest rate for each day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at each applicable interest rate.

      (2) To compute the average daily balance of unpaid accrued interest for purposes of special allowance on loans covered by § 682.215(b)(7), the lender adds the unpaid accrued interest on such loans for each eligible day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at the applicable interest rate.

      (3) The Secretary computes the special allowance payable to a lender based upon the average daily balance computed by the lender under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

      § 682.305   Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance and collection of origination and loan fees.

#### § § 682.305

      (a)  (1) If a lender owes origination fees or loan fees under paragraph (a) of this section, it must submit quarterly reports to the Secretary on a form provided or prescribed by the Secretary, even if the lender is not owed, or does not wish to receive, interest benefits or special allowance from the Secretary.

      (2) The lender shall report, on the quarterly report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of origination fees it was authorized to collect and the amount of those fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter covered by the report.

      (3)(i)(A) The Secretary reduces the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the lender by—

      () The amount of origination fees the lender was authorized to collect during the quarter under § 682.202(c), whether or not the lender actually collected that amount; and

      () The amount of lender fees payable under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; and

      () The amount of excess interest, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (B) The Secretary increases the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the lender by the amount of origination fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter under § 682.202(c).

      (ii)(A) For any FFEL loan made on or after October 1, 1993, a lender shall pay the Secretary a loan fee equal to 0.50% of the principal amount of the loan.

      (B) For any FFEL loan made on or after October 1, 2007 and prior to July 1, 2010, a lender shall pay the Secretary a loan fee equal to 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan.

      (iii) The Secretary collects from an originating lender the amount of origination fees the originating lender was authorized to collect from borrowers during the quarter whether or not the originating lender actually collected those fees. The Secretary also collects the fees the originating lender is required to pay under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. Generally, the Secretary collects the fees from the originating lender by offsetting the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the originating lender in a quarter, and, if necessary, the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable in subsequent quarters may be offset until the total amount of fees has been recovered.

      (iv) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two quarters by reducing interest and special allowance payable to the originating lender, the Secretary may collect the unpaid amount directly from the originating lender.

      (v) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two quarters from the originating lender in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section and if the originating lender has transferred the loan to a subsequent holder, the Secretary may, following written notice, collect the unpaid amount from the holder by using the same steps described in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, with the term “holder” substituting for the term “originating lender”.

      (4) If an originating lender sells or otherwise transfers a loan to a new holder, the originating lender remains liable to the Secretary for payment of the origination fees. The Secretary will not pay interest benefits or special allowance to the new holder or pay reinsurance to the guaranty agency until the origination fees are paid to the Secretary.

      (b)  (1)(i) If the Secretary does not pay interest benefits or the special allowance within 30 days after the Secretary receives an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from a lender, the Secretary pays the lender penalty interest.

      (ii) The payment of interest benefits or special allowance is deemed to occur, for purposes of this paragraph, when the Secretary—

      (A) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the lender;

      (B) Credits the payment due the lender against a debt that the Secretary determines is owed the Secretary by the lender; or

      (C) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the amount due by the lender to another Federal agency for credit against a debt that the Federal agency has determined the lender owes.

      (2) Penalty interest is an amount that accrues daily on interest benefits and special allowance due to the lender. The penalty interest is computed by—

      (i) Multiplying the daily interest rate applicable to loans on which payment for interest benefits was requested, by the amount of interest benefits due on those loans for each interest rate;

      (ii) Multiplying the daily special allowance rate applicable to loans on which special allowance was requested by the amount of special allowance due on those loans for each interest rate and special allowance category;

      (iii) Adding the results of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to determine the gross penalty interest to be paid for each day that penalty interest is due;

      (iv) Dividing the results of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section by the gross amount of interest benefits and special allowance due to obtain the average penalty interest rate;

      (v) Multiplying the rate obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section by the total amount of reduction to gross interest benefits and special allowance due (e.g., origination fees or other debts owed to the Federal Government);

      (vi) Subtracting the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section from the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to obtain the net amount of penalty interest due per day; and

      (vii) Multiplying the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section by the number of days calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (3) The Secretary pays penalty interest for the period—

      (i) Beginning on the later of—

      (A) The 31st day after the final day of the quarter covered by the request for payment; or

      (B) The 31st day after the Secretary's receipt of an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from the lender; and

      (ii) Ending on the day the Secretary pays the interest benefits and the special allowance at issue, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (4) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is considered timely only if it is received by the Secretary within 90 days following the end of the quarter to which the request pertains.

      (5) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is not considered accurate and complete if it—

      (i) Requests payments to which the lender is not entitled under §§ 682.300 through 682.302;

      (ii) Includes loans that the Secretary, in writing, has directed that the lender exclude from the request;

      (iii) Does not contain all information required by the Secretary or contains conflicting information; or

      (iv) Is not provided and certified on the form and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.

      (c)  (1)(i) A lender holding more than $5 million in FFEL loans during its fiscal year must submit an independent annual compliance audit for that year, conducted by a qualified independent organization or person.

      (ii) The Secretary may, following written notice, suspend the payment of interest benefits and special allowance to a lender that does not submit its audit within the time period prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (2) The audit required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must—

      (i) Examine the lender's compliance with the Act and applicable regulations;

      (ii) Examine the lender's financial management of its FFEL program activities;

      (iii) Be conducted in accordance with the standards for audits issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO's)  Procedures for audits are contained in an audit guide developed by and available from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department;

      (iv) Be conducted at least annually and be submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The initial audit must be of the lender's first fiscal year that begins after July 23, 1992, and must be submitted within six months of the end of the audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the lender's activities for the period beginning no later than the end of the period covered by the preceding audit; and

      (v) A lender must conduct the audit required by this paragraph in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F—Audit Requirements.

      (3) The Secretary may determine that a lender has met the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the lender has been audited in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 for other purposes, the lender submits the results of the audit to the Office of Inspector General, and the Secretary determines that the audit meets the requirements of this paragraph.

      (d)  (1) For any loan for which the first disbursement of principal is made on or after April 1, 2006, the Secretary collects the amount of excess interest paid to a lender on a quarterly basis when the applicable interest rate on a loan for each quarter exceeds the special allowance support level in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the loan. Excess interest is calculated and recovered each quarter by subtracting the special allowance support level from the applicable interest rate, multiplying the result by the average daily principal balance of the loan (not including unearned interest added to principal) during the quarter, and dividing by four.

      (2) The term  means a number expressed as a percentage equal to the sum of—

      (i) The average of the bond equivalent rates of the quotes of the 3-month commercial paper (financial) rates in effect for each of the days in such quarter as reported by the Federal Reserve in Publication H-15 (or its successor) for such 3-month period; plus

      (ii) 2.34 percent for a Federal Stafford loan in repayment;

      (iii) 1.74 percent for a Federal Stafford loan during the in-school, grace, and deferment periods; or

      (iv) 2.64 percent for a Federal PLUS or Consolidation Loan.

      (3)  (i) Except for a Consolidation Loan or refinanced SLS or PLUS loans, a guaranty agency:

      § 682.402   Death, disability, closed school, false certification, unpaid refunds, and bankruptcy payments.

#### § § 682.402

      (a)  (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death, total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, false certification by a school of a borrower's eligibility for a loan, and unpaid refunds by a school are set forth in this section.

      (2) If a Consolidation loan was obtained jointly by a married couple, the amount of the Consolidation loan that is discharged if one of the borrowers dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled is equal to the portion of the outstanding balance of the Consolidation loan, as of the date the borrower died or became totally and permanently disabled, attributable to any of that borrower's loans that would have been eligible for discharge.

      (3) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated to repay the loan unless that borrower would qualify for discharge of the loan under these regulations.

      (4) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the Secretary under the false certification discharge provision of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment under this section and as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan.

      (5) For purposes of this section—

      (i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;

      (ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with consumer reporting agency reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or in any other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and

      (iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.

      (b)  (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged.

      (2)(i) A discharge of a loan based on the death of the borrower (or student in the case of a PLUS loan) must be based on—

      (A) An original or certified copy of the death certificate;

      (B) An accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate;

      (C) An accurate and complete original or certified copy of the death certificate that is scanned and submitted electronically or sent by facsimile transmission; or

      (D) Verification of the borrower's or student's death through an authoritative Federal or State electronic database approved for use by the Secretary.

      (ii) Under exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, the chief executive officer of the guaranty agency may approve a discharge based upon other reliable documentation of the borrower's or student's death.

      (3) After receiving reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender must suspend any collection activity against the borrower and any endorser for up to 60 days and promptly request the documentation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If additional time is required to obtain the documentation, the period of suspension of collection activity may be extended up to an additional 60 days. If the lender is not able to obtain an original or certified copy of the death certificate, or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate or other documentation acceptable to the guaranty agency, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, during the period of suspension, the lender must resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued. The lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.

      (4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser.

      (5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of the borrower's (or student's) death.

      (6) In the case of a Federal Consolidation Loan that includes a Federal PLUS or Direct PLUS loan borrowed for a dependent who has died, the obligation of the borrower or any endorser to make any further payments on the portion of the outstanding balance of the Consolidation Loan attributable to the Federal PLUS or Direct PLUS loan is discharged as of the date of the dependent's death.

      (c)(1)  (i) A borrower's loan is discharged if the borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined in § 682.200(b), and satisfies the eligibility requirements in this section.

      (ii) For a borrower who becomes totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the borrower's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section.

      (iii) For a veteran who is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the veteran's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

      (iv) For purposes of this paragraph (c)—

      (A) A borrower's representative or a veteran's representative is a member of the borrower's family, the borrower's attorney, or another individual authorized to act on behalf of the borrower in connection with the borrower's total and permanent disability discharge application.

      (B) References to “the lender” mean the guaranty agency if the guaranty agency is the holder of the loan at the time the borrower applies for a total and permanent disability discharge, except that the total and permanent disability discharge claim filing requirements applicable to a lender do not apply to the guaranty agency; and

      (C) References to “the applicable guaranty agency” mean the guaranty agency that guarantees the loan.

      (2)  (i) If the borrower notifies the lender that the borrower claims to be totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the lender must direct the borrower to notify the Secretary of the borrower's intent to submit an application for total and permanent disability discharge and provide the borrower with the information needed for the borrower to notify the Secretary.

      (ii) If the borrower notifies the Secretary of the borrower's intent to apply for a total and permanent disability discharge, the Secretary—

      (A) Provides the borrower with information needed for the borrower to apply for a total and permanent disability discharge;

      (B) Identifies all title IV loans owed by the borrower and notifies the lenders of the borrower's intent to apply for a total and permanent disability discharge;

      (D) Informs the borrower that the suspension of collection activity described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section will end after 120 days and collection will resume on the loans if the borrower does not submit a total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary within that time;

      (iii) If the borrower fails to submit an application for a total and permanent disability discharge to the Secretary within 120 days, collection resumes on the borrower's title IV loans, and the lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection activity. The lender may capitalize, in accordance with § 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period, except that if the lender is a guaranty agency it may not capitalize accrued interest.

      (iv) The borrower must submit to the Secretary an application for a total and permanent disability discharge on a form approved by the Secretary. The application must contain—

      (A) A certification by a physician, who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice in a State, that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b);

      (v) The borrower must submit the application described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section to the Secretary within 90 days of the date the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certifies the application, if applicable.

      (vi) After the Secretary receives the application described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the Secretary notifies the holders of the borrower's title IV loans that the Secretary has received a total and permanent disability discharge application from the borrower. The holders of the loans must notify the applicable guaranty agency that the total and permanent disability discharge application has been received.

      (vii) If the application is incomplete, the Secretary notifies the borrower of the missing information and requests the missing information from the borrower or the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist who provided the certification, as appropriate. The Secretary does not make a determination of eligibility until the application is complete.

      (viii) The lender notification described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section directs the borrower's loan holders to suspend collection activity or maintain the suspension of collection activity on the borrower's title IV loans.

      (C) Explains the process for the Secretary's review of total and permanent disability discharge applications.

      (3)  (i) If, after reviewing the borrower's completed application, the Secretary determines that the data described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section supports the conclusion that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled, as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the borrower is considered totally and permanently disabled—

      (A) As of the date the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certified the borrower's application; or

      (B) As of the date the Secretary received the SSA data described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.

      (ii) If the Secretary determines that the borrower's application does not support the conclusion that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b) the Secretary may require the borrower to submit additional medical evidence. As part of the Secretary's review of the borrower's discharge application, the Secretary may require and arrange for an additional review of the borrower's condition by an independent physician or other medical professional identified by the Secretary at no expense to the borrower.

      (iii) After determining that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the Secretary notifies the borrower and the borrower's lenders that the application for a disability discharge has been approved. With this notification, the Secretary provides the date the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certified the borrower's loan discharge application or the date the Secretary received the SSA data described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section and directs each lender to submit a disability claim to the guaranty agency so the loan can be assigned to the Secretary.

      (iv) After the loan is assigned, the Secretary discharges the borrower's obligation to make further payments on the loan and notifies the borrower and the lender that the loan has been discharged. The notification to the borrower explains the terms and conditions under which the borrower's obligation to repay the loan will be reinstated, as specified in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section.

      (v) If the Secretary determines that the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certification or SSA data described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section does not support the conclusion that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the Secretary notifies the borrower and the lender that the application for a disability discharge has been denied. The notification includes—

      (A) The reason or reasons for the denial;

      (E) An explanation that if the borrower does not request re-evaluation of the borrower's prior discharge application within 12 months of the date of the notification, the borrower must submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary if the borrower wishes the Secretary to re-evaluate the borrower's eligibility for a total and permanent disability discharge.

      (vi) If the borrower requests re-evaluation in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D) of this section or submits a new total and permanent disability discharge application in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(v)(E) of this section, the request must include new information regarding the borrower's disabling condition that was not provided to the Secretary in connection with the prior application at the time the Secretary reviewed the borrower's initial application for a total and permanent disability discharge.

The agency may capitalize, in accordance with § 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

      (J) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty agency, or the Secretary.

      (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.

      (v) Upon receipt of a discharge claim filed by a lender or a complete application submitted by a borrower with respect to a loan held by the guaranty agency, the agency will have up to 90 days to determine whether the discharge should be granted.

      (ii) The Secretary notifies the agency and the borrower of a determination on review. If the Secretary determines that the borrower is not eligible for a discharge under this paragraph (e), within 30 days after being so informed, the agency will take the actions described in paragraphs (e)(9)(iv) through (vii) or (e)(10)(iii) through (v) of this section, as applicable.

      (iii) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the requirements for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, the agency will, within 30 days after being so informed, take the actions required under paragraph (e)(8)(ii), (e)(9)(ii) or (iii), (e)(10)(ii), or (e)(11)(ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable.

      (13)  (i) If the lender is notified by a guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it believes to be reliable from another source indicating that a current or former borrower may be eligible for a discharge under this paragraph (e), the lender will immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments) and, within 30 days of receiving the information or notification, inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.

If the lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the proceeds were received by the borrower or student, the lender may consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of intention not to repay the loan and may file a claim with the guaranty agency for reimbursement on that ground but will not report the loan to consumer reporting agencies as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief. By filing such a claim, the lender will be deemed to have agreed to the following—

      (A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan were received by the borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence requirements by the lender prior to the filing of the claim that would have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of default will be waived by the Secretary; and

      (B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower did not endorse the loan check and that the proceeds of the loan were not received by the borrower or the student, the lender will comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(9)(ii)(B) of this section.

      (vii) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that the borrower's request for a discharge has been denied, the lender will notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are due, resume collection against the borrower. The lender will be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance with § 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

      (14)  (i) For purposes of this section, identity theft is defined as the unauthorized use of the identifying information of another individual that is punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1028, 1028A, 1029, or 1030, or substantially comparable State or local law.

      (C) Unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or

      (D) Telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1029(e)).

      (15)  A borrower's obligation to repay all or a portion of an FFEL Program loan may be discharged without an application from the borrower if the Secretary, or the guaranty agency with the Secretary's permission, determines based on information in the Secretary's or the guaranty agency's possession that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.

      (iv) In the case of a claim filed by a lender based on a request received from a borrower whose loan had been repaid in full by, or on behalf of the borrower to the lender, on the same date that the agency notifies the lender that the borrower is eligible for a closed school or false certification discharge, the agency shall pay the borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by or on behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds or payments received by the holder or the borrower from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third-party source.

      () Received by the borrower or received by the holder and applied to the borrower's loan balance before the date the loan was repaid through consolidation; or

      () Received by the borrower or received by the Consolidation Loan holder on or after the date the consolidating lender made a payment to the former holder to discharge the borrower's obligation to that former holder.

      (i) —(1)  (i) In response to a petition filed prior to October 8, 1998 with regard to any bankruptcy proceeding by the borrower for discharge under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) on the grounds of undue hardship, the guaranty agency must, on the basis of reasonably available information, determine whether the first payment on the loan was due more than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period) before the filing of that petition and, if so, process the claim.

      (ii) In all other cases, the guaranty agency must determine whether repayment under either the current repayment schedule or any adjusted schedule authorized under this part would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.

      (iii) If the guaranty agency determines that repayment would not constitute an undue hardship, the guaranty agency must then determine whether the expected costs of opposing the discharge petition would exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, including principal, interest, late charges, and collection costs. If the guaranty agency has determined that the expected costs of opposing the discharge petition will exceed one-third of the total amount of the loan, it may, but is not required to, engage in the activities described in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this section.

      (iv) The guaranty agency must use diligence and may assert any defense consistent with its status under applicable law to avoid discharge of the loan. Unless discharge would be more effectively opposed by not taking the following actions, the agency must—

      (A) Oppose the borrower's petition for a determination of dischargeability; and

      (B) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for the amount owed on the loan.

      (v) In opposing a petition for a determination of dischargeability on the grounds of undue hardship, a guaranty agency may agree to discharge of a portion of the amount owed on a loan if it reasonably determines that the agreement is necessary in order to obtain a judgment on the remainder of the loan.

      (2)  The guaranty agency shall take the following actions when a petition for relief in bankruptcy under Chapters 11, 12, or 13 is filed:

      (i) The agency is not required to respond to a proposed plan that—

      (A) Provides for repayment of the full outstanding balance of the loan;

      (B) Makes no provision with regard to the loan or to general unsecured claims.

      (ii) In any other case, the agency shall determine, based on a review of its own records and documents filed by the debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding—

      (A) What part of the loan obligation will be discharged under the plan as proposed;

      (B) Whether the plan itself or the classification of the loan under the plan meets the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1129, 1225, or 1325, as applicable; and

      (C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1112, 1208, or 1307, as applicable, to move for conversion or dismissal of the case.

      (iii) If the agency determines that grounds exist to challenge the proposed plan, the agency shall, as appropriate, object to the plan or move to dismiss the case, if—

      (A) The costs of litigation of these actions are not reasonably expected to exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged under the plan; and

      (B) With respect to an objection under 11 U.S.C. 1325, the additional amount that may be recovered under the plan if an objection is successful can reasonably be expected to equal or exceed the cost of litigating the objection.

      (iv) The agency shall monitor the debtor's performance under a confirmed plan. If the debtor fails to make payments required under the plan or seeks but does not demonstrate entitlement to discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), the agency shall oppose any requested discharge or move to dismiss the case if the costs of litigation together with the costs incurred for objections to the plan are not reasonably expected to exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged under the plan.

      (j)  (1) The lender shall repurchase from the guaranty agency a loan held by the agency pursuant to a bankruptcy claim paid to that lender, unless the guaranty agency sells the loan to another lender, promptly after the earliest of the following events:

      (i) The entry of an order denying or revoking discharge or dismissing a proceeding under any chapter.

      (ii) A ruling in a proceeding under chapter 7 or 11 that the loan is not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) or other applicable law.

      (iii) The entry of an order granting discharge under chapter 12 or 13, or confirming a plan of arrangement under chapter 11, unless the court determined that the loan is dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) on grounds of undue hardship.

      (2) The lender may capitalize all outstanding interest accrued on a loan purchased under paragraph (j) of this section to cover any periods of delinquency prior to the bankruptcy action through the date the lender purchases the loan and receives the supporting loan documentation from the guaranty agency.

      (k)  (1)(i) The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for its losses on bankruptcy claims paid to lenders after—

      (A) A determination by the court that the loan is dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) with respect to a proceeding initiated under chapter 7 or chapter 11; or

      (B) With respect to any other loan, after the agency pays the claim to the lender.

      (ii) The guaranty agency shall refund to the Secretary the full amount of reimbursement received from the Secretary on a loan that a lender repurchases under this section.

      (2) The Secretary pays a death, disability, bankruptcy, closed school, or false certification claim in an amount determined under § 682.402(k)(5) on a loan held by a guaranty agency after the agency has paid a default claim to the lender thereon and received payment under its reinsurance agreement. The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency only if—

      (i) The Secretary determines that the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has become totally and permanently disabled since applying for the loan, or the guaranty agency determines that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has died, or has filed for relief in bankruptcy, in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, or the student was unable to complete an educational program because the school closed, or the borrower's eligibility to borrow (or the student's eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was falsely certified by an eligible school. For purposes of this paragraph, references to the “lender” and “guaranty agency” in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section mean the guaranty agency and the Secretary respectively;

      (ii) In the case of a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, the Secretary determines that the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has become totally and permanently disabled since applying for the loan, the guaranty agency determines that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has died, or has filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within 10 years of the date the borrower entered repayment, exclusive of periods of deferment or periods of forbearance granted by the lender that extended the 10-year maximum repayment period, or the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) was unable to complete an educational program because the school closed, or the borrower's eligibility to borrow (or the student's eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was falsely certified by an eligible school;

      (iii) In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower (or one of the co-makers) has died, is determined by the Secretary to be totally and permanently disabled under § 682.402(c), or has filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within the maximum repayment period described in § 682.209(h)(2), exclusive of periods of deferment or periods of forbearance granted by the lender that extended the maximum repayment period;

      (iv) The guaranty agency has not written off the loan in accordance with the procedures established by the agency under § 682.410(b)(6)(x), except for closed school and false certification discharges; and

      (v) The guaranty agency has exercised due diligence in the collection of the loan in accordance with the procedures established by the agency under § 682.410(b)(6)(x), until the borrower (or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has become totally and permanently disabled or filed a Chapter 12 or Chapter 13 petition, or had the loan discharged in bankruptcy, or for closed school and false certification claims, the guaranty agency receives a request for discharge from the borrower or another party.

      (3) [Reserved]

      (4) Within 30 days of receiving reimbursement for a closed school or false certification claim, the guaranty agency shall pay—

      (i) The borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by or on behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds or payments received by the holder, guaranty agency, or the borrower from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third-party source; or

      (ii) The amount determined under paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section to the holder of the borrower's Consolidation Loan.

      (5) The Secretary pays the guaranty agency a percentage of the outstanding principal and interest that is equal to the complement of the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan. This interest includes interest that accrues during—

      (i) For death or bankruptcy claims, the shorter of 60 days or the period from the date the guaranty agency determines that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) died, or filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy until the Secretary authorizes payment;

      (l) —(1)  In the case of a school that has closed, the Secretary reimburses the guarantor of a loan and discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an FFEL Program loan (disbursed, in whole or in part on or after January 1, 1986) equal to the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section. Any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the unpaid refund are also discharged.

      (2)  In the case of a school that is open, the guarantor discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an FFEL loan (disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986) equal to the amount of the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section, if—

      (i) The borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) is not attending the school that owes the refund; and

      (ii) The guarantor receives documentation regarding the refund and the borrower and guarantor have been unable to resolve the unpaid refund within 120 days from the date the guarantor receivesa complete application in accordance with paragraph (l)(4) of this section. Any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the amount of the unpaid refund amount are also discharged.

      (3)  (i) If a borrower receives a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, the borrower is reimbursed for any amounts paid in excess of the remaining balance of the loan (including accrued interest, late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) owed by the borrower at the time of discharge.

      (ii) The holder of the loan reports the discharge of a portion of a loan under this section to all credit reporting agencies to which the holder of the loan previously reported the status of the loan.

      (4)  To receive a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit a written application to the holder or guaranty agency except as provided in paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section. The application requests the information required to calculate the amount of the discharge and requires the borrower to sign a statement swearing to the accuracy of the information in the application. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must—

      (i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—

      (A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;

      (B) Did not attend, withdrew, or was terminated from the school within a timeframe that entitled the borrower to a refund; and

      (C) Did not receive the benefit of a refund to which the borrower was entitled either from the school or from a third party, such as a holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program.

      (ii) State whether the borrower has any other application for discharge pending for this loan; and

      (iii) State that the borrower—

      (A) Agrees to provide upon request by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for an unpaid refund discharge under this section; and

      (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (5)  (i) Except for the requirements of paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section related to an open school, if the holder or guaranty agency learns that a school did not pay a refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, the holder or the guaranty agency sends the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The holder of the loan also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan.

      (ii) If the borrower returns the application, specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the holder or the guaranty agency must review the application to determine whether the application appears to be complete. In the case of a loan held by a lender, once the lender determines that the application appears complete, it must provide the application and all pertinent information to the guaranty agency including, if available, the borrower's last date of attendance. If the borrower returns the application within 60 days, the lender must extend the period during which efforts to collect on the affected loan are suspended to the date the lender receives either a denial of the request or the unpaid refund amount from the guaranty agency. At the conclusion of the period during which the collection activity was suspended, the lender may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period in accordance with § 682.202(b).

      (iii) If the borrower fails to return the application within 60 days, the holder of the loan resumes collection efforts and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period during which the collection activity was suspended. The holder may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period in accordance with § 682.202(b).

      (iv) The guaranty agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, discharge a portion of a loan under this section without an application if the guaranty agency determines, based on information in the guaranty agency's possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.

      (v) If the holder of the loan or the guaranty agency determines that the information contained in its files conflicts with the information provided by the borrower, the guaranty agency must use the most reliable information available to it to determine eligibility for and the appropriate payment of the refund amount.

      (vi) If the holder of the loan is the guaranty agency and the agency determines that the borrower qualifies for a discharge of an unpaid refund, the guaranty agency must suspend any efforts to collect on the affected loan and, within 30 days of its determination, discharge the appropriate amount and inform the borrower of its determination. Absent documentation of the exact amount of refund due the borrower, the guaranty agency must calculate the amount of the unpaid refund using the unpaid refund calculation defined in paragraph (o) of this section.

      (vii) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower does not qualify for an unpaid refund discharge, (or, if the holder is the lender and is informed by the guarantor that the borrower does not qualify for a discharge)—

      (A) Within 30 days of the guarantor's determination, the agency must notify the borrower in writing of the reason for the determination and of the borrower's right to request a review of the agency's determination. The guaranty agency must make a determination within 30 days of the borrower's submission of additional documentation supporting the borrower's eligibility that was not considered in any prior determination. During the review period, collection activities must be suspended; and

      (B) The holder must resume collection if the determination remains unchanged and grant forbearance of principal and interest for any period during which collection activity was suspended under this section. The holder may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during these periods in accordance with § 682.202(b).

      (viii) If the guaranty agency determines that a current or former borrower at an open school may be eligible for a discharge under this section, the guaranty agency must notify the lender and the school of the unpaid refund allegation. The notice to the school must include all pertinent facts available to the guaranty agency regarding the alleged unpaid refund. The school must, no later than 60 days after receiving the notice, provide the guaranty agency with documentation demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the guarantor, that the alleged unpaid refund was either paid or not required to be paid.

      (ix) In the case of a school that does not make a refund or provide sufficient documentation demonstrating the refund was either paid or was not required, within 60 days of its receipt of the allegation notice from the guaranty agency, relief is provided to the borrower (and any endorser) if the guaranty agency determines the relief is appropriate. The agency must forward documentation of the school's failure to pay the unpaid refund to the Secretary.

      (m)  In the case of an unpaid refund discharge request, the lender must provide the guaranty agency with documentation related to the borrower's qualification for discharge as specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section.

      (n) —(1)  The guaranty agency must review an unpaid refund discharge request promptly and must pay the lender the amount of loss as defined in paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of this section, related to the unpaid refund not later than 45 days after a properly filed request is made.

      (2)  The amount of loss payable to a lender on an unpaid refund includes that portion of an FFEL Program loan equal to the amount of the refund required under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section, and including any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the unpaid refund.

      (o)(1)  The guaranty agency determines the amount eligible for discharge based on information showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate refund formula to information that the borrower provides or that is otherwise available to the guaranty agency. For purposes of this section, all unpaid refunds are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.

      (2) If the information in paragraph (o)(1) of this section is not available, the guaranty agency uses the following formulas to determine the amount eligible for discharge:

      (i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency discharges the lesser of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The guaranty agency determines the amount of the institutional charges unearned by—

      (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and

      (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges assessed the student for the loan period.

      (ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency discharges the loan amount unearned. The guaranty agency determines the loan amount unearned by—

      (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and

      (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV grants and loans received by the student, or if unknown, the loan amount.

      (iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period, the guaranty agency does not discharge any amount because a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is not entitled to a refund.

      (p)  The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for its losses on unpaid refund request payments to lenders or borrowers in an amount that is equal to the amount specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section.

      (q)  (1) The holder must promptly return to the sender any payment on a fully discharged loan, received after the guaranty agency pays an unpaid refund request unless the sender is required to pay (as in the case of a tuition recovery fund) in which case, the payment amount must be forwarded to the Secretary. At the same time that the holder returns the payment, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan fully discharged.

      (2) If the holder has returned a payment to the borrower, or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraph (q)(1) of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues to send payments to the holder, the holder must remit all of those payments to the Secretary.

      (3) If the loan has not been fully discharged, payments must be applied to the remaining debt.

      (r)  (1) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been discharged in bankruptcy on which the Secretary previously paid a bankruptcy claim, the guaranty agency must return 100 percent of these payments to the sender. The guaranty agency must promptly return, to the sender, any payment on a cancelled or discharged loan made by the sender and received after the Secretary pays a closed school or false certification claim. At the same time that the agency returns the payment, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan discharged on the basis of death, bankruptcy, false certification, or closing of the school.

      (2) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been assigned to the Secretary based on the determination that the borrower is eligible for a total and permanent disability discharge, the guaranty agency must promptly return these payments to the sender. At the same time that the agency returns the payments, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to make payments on the loan after it has been discharged due to a total and permanent disability, unless the loan is reinstated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or the Secretary directs the borrower otherwise.

      (3) When the Secretary discharges the loan, the Secretary returns to the sender any payments received by the Secretary on the loan after the date the borrower became totally and permanently disabled.

      (4) The guaranty agency shall remit to the Secretary all payments received from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third party with respect to a loan on which the Secretary previously paid a closed school or false certification claim.

      (5) If the guaranty agency has returned a payment to the borrower, or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraphs (r)(1) or (r)(2) of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues to send payments to the guaranty agency, the agency must remit all of those payments to the Secretary.

      (s)  For purposes of this section and 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A) with respect to loans guaranteed under the FFEL Program, an applicable suspension of the repayment period—

      (1) Includes any period during which the lender does not require the borrower to make a payment on the loan.

      (2) Begins on the date on which the borrower qualifies for the requested deferment as provided in § 682.210(a)(5) or the lender grants the requested forbearance;

      (3) Closes on the later of the date on which—

      (i) The condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance was received ends; or

      (ii) The lender receives notice of the end of the condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance was received, if the condition ended earlier than represented by the borrower at the time of the request and the borrower did not notify timely the lender of the date on which the condition actually ended;

      (4) Includes the period between the end of the borrower's grace period and the first payment due date established by the lender in the case of a borrower who entered repayment without the knowledge of the lender;

      (5) Includes the period between the filing of the petition for relief and the date on which the proceeding is completed or dismissed, unless payments have been made during that period in amounts sufficient to meet the amount owed under the repayment schedule in effect when the petition was filed.

      (3) A guaranty agency's loss on a loan that was outstanding when a reinsurance agreement was executed is covered by the reinsurance agreement only if the default on the loan occurs after the effective date of the agreement.

      (4) If a lender has requested default aversion assistance as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the agency must, upon request of the school at which the borrower received the loan, notify the school of the lender's request.

      (c)  The guaranty agency shall submit to the Secretary the quarterly report required by the Secretary for the previous quarter ending September 30 containing complete and accurate data in order for the Secretary to calculate the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year. The Secretary does not pay a reinsurance claim to the guaranty agency after the date the guarterly report is due until the quaranty agency submits a complete and accurate report.

      (d)  (1) Except for loans that were refinanced pursuant to section 428B(e)(2) and (3) of the Act, and all loans guaranteed on or after October 1, 1993, a guaranty agency shall pay to the Secretary during each fiscal year in quarterly installments a reinsurance fee equal to—

      (e)  In deciding whether to enter into or extend a reinsurance agreement, or, if an agreement has been terminated, whether to enter into a new agreement, the Secretary considers the adequacy of—

      (1) Efforts by the guaranty agency and the lenders to which it provides guarantees to collect outstanding loans as required by § 682.410(b) (6) or (7), and § 682.411;

      (2) Efforts by the guaranty agency to make FFEL loans available to all eligible borrowers; and

      (3) Other relevant aspects of the guaranty agency's program operations.

      (f)  A payment made to a guaranty agency by a borrower on a defaulted loan must be applied first to the collection costs incurred to collect that amount and then to other incidental charges, such as late charges, then to accrued interest and then to principal.

      (E) 16 percent of borrower payments received on or after October 1, 2007.

      (2) Unless the Secretary approves otherwise, the guaranty agency must pay to the Secretary the Secretary's share of borrower payments within 45 days of its receipt of the payments.

      (h)  A guaranty agency is paid an account maintenance fee based on the original principal amount of outstanding FFEL Program loans insured by the agency. For fiscal years 1999 and 2000, the fee is 0.12 percent of the original principal amount of outstanding loans. For fiscal years 2000 through 2007, the fee is 0.10 percent of the original principal amount of outstanding loans. After fiscal year 2007, the fee is 0.06 percent of the original principal amount of outstanding loans.

      (i)  A guaranty agency is paid a loan processing and issuance fee based on the principal amount of FFEL Program loans originated during a fiscal year that are insured by the agency. The fee is paid quarterly. No payment is made for loans for which the disbursement checks have not been cashed or for which electronic funds transfers have not been completed. For fiscal years 1999 through 2003, the fee is 0.65 percent of the principal amount of loans originated. Beginning October 1, 2003, the fee is 0.40 percent.

      (j) —(1)  If a guaranty agency performs default aversion activities on a delinquent loan in response to a lender's request for default aversion assistance on that loan, the agency receives a default aversion fee. The fee may not be paid more than once on any loan. The lender's request for assistance must be submitted to the guaranty agency no earlier than the 60th day and no later than the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency. A guaranty agency may not restrict a lender's choice of the date during this period on which the lender submits a request for default aversion assistance.

      (2)  No more frequently than monthly, a guaranty agency may transfer default aversion fees from the Federal Fund to its Operating Fund. The amount of the fees that may be transferred is equal to—

      (i) One percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest owed on loans that were submitted by lenders to the agency for default aversion assistance; minus

      (ii) One percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest owed by borrowers on default claims that—

      (A) Were paid by the agency for the same time period for which the agency transferred default aversion fees from its Federal Fund; and

      (B) For which default aversion fees have been received by the agency.

      (3)  (i) For purposes of calculating the one percent default aversion fee described in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the agency must use the total unpaid principal and accrued interest owed by the borrower as of the date the default aversion assistance request is submitted by the lender.

      (4)  If a guaranty agency contracts with an outside entity to perform any default aversion activities, that outside entity may not—

      (i) Hold or service the loan; or

      (ii) Perform collection activities on the loan in the event of default within 3 years of the claim payment date.

      (k)  The reinsurance agreement contains other terms and conditions that the Secretary finds necessary to—

      (1) Promote the purposes of the FFEL programs and to protect the United States from unreasonable risks of loss;

      (2) Ensure proper and efficient administration of the loan guarantee program; and

      (3) Ensure that due diligence will be exercised in the collection of loans.

      § 682.405   Loan rehabilitation agreement.

#### § § 682.405

      (a)  (1) A guaranty agency that has a basic program agreement must enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement with the Secretary. The guaranty agency must establish a loan rehabilitation program for all borrowers with an enforceable promissory note for the purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans, except for loans for which a judgment has been obtained, loans on which a default claim was filed under § 682.412, and loans on which the borrower has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance, so that the loan may be purchased, if practicable, by an eligible lender and removed from default status.

      (2) A loan is considered to be rehabilitated only after—

      (i) The borrower has made and the guaranty agency has received nine of the ten qualifying payments required under a monthly repayment agreement.

      (A) A qualifying payment is—

      () Made voluntarily;

      () In the full amount required; and

      () Received within 20 days of the due date for the payment, and

      (B) All nine payments are received within a 10-month period that begins with the month in which the first required due date falls and ends with the ninth consecutive calendar month following that month, and

      (ii) The loan has been sold to an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary.

      (3)(i) If a borrower's loan is being collected by administrative wage garnishment while the borrower is also making monthly payments on the same loan under a loan rehabilitation agreement, the guaranty agency must continue collecting the loan by administrative wage garnishment until the borrower makes five qualifying monthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, unless the guaranty agency is otherwise precluded from doing so under § 682.410(b)(9).

      (ii) After the borrower makes the fifth qualifying monthly payment, the guaranty agency must, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, suspend the garnishment order issued to the borrower's employer.

      (iii) A borrower may only obtain the benefit of a suspension of administrative wage garnishment while also attempting to rehabilitate a defaulted loan once.

      (4) After the loan has been rehabilitated, the borrower regains all benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility under section 428(b)(1)(M) of the Act, from the date of the rehabilitation. Effective for any loan that is rehabilitated on or after August 14, 2008, the borrower cannot rehabilitate the loan again if the loan returns to default status following the rehabilitation.

      (b)  In the loan rehabilitation agreement, the guaranty agency agrees to ensure that its loan rehabilitation program meets the following requirements at all times:

      (1) A borrower may request rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted loan held by the guaranty agency. In order to be eligible for rehabilitation of the loan, the borrower must voluntarily make at least 9 of the 10 payments required under a monthly repayment agreement.

      (i) Each payment must be—

      (A) Made voluntarily;

      (B) For the full amount required;

      (C) Received within 20 days of the due date for the payment; and

      (D) Reasonable and affordable.

      (ii) All 9 payments must be received within a 10-month period that begins with the month in which the first required due date falls and ends with the ninth consecutive calendar month following that month.

      (iii) The guaranty agency initially considers the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount to be an amount equal to 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline amount applicable to the borrower's family size and State, divided by 12, except that if this amount is less than $5, the borrower's monthly rehabilitation payment is $5.

      (iv) The guaranty agency or its agents may calculate the payment amount based on information provided orally by the borrower or the borrower's representative and provide the borrower with a rehabilitation agreement using that amount. The guaranty agency must request documentation from the borrower to confirm the borrower's AGI and family size. If the borrower does not provide the guaranty agency or its agents with any documentation requested by the guaranty agency to calculate or confirm the reasonable and affordable payment amount, within a reasonable time deadline set by the guaranty agency or its agent, the rehabilitation agreement provided is null and void.

      (v) The reasonable and affordable payment amount calculated under this section must not be—

      (A) A required minimum loan payment amount (e.g., $50) if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable;

      (B) A percentage of the borrower's total loan balance; or

      (C) Based on other criteria unrelated to the borrower's total financial circumstances.

      (vi) Within 15 business days of its determination of the borrower's loan rehabilitation payment amount, the guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written rehabilitation agreement which includes the borrower's payment amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii), a prominent statement that the borrower may object orally or in writing to the payment amount, with the method and timeframe for raising such an objection, and an explanation of any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made before the borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by an eligible lender or assignment to the Secretary (i.e., rehabilitated). To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the agency. The agency may not impose any conditions unrelated to the amount or timing of the rehabilitation payments in the rehabilitation agreement. The written rehabilitation agreement must inform the borrower—

      (A) Of the effects of having the loans rehabilitated (e.g., removal of the record of default from the borrower's credit history and return to normal repayment);

      (B) Of the amount of any collection costs to be added to the unpaid principal of the loan when the loan is sold to an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary, which may not exceed 16 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan at the time of the sale or assignment; and

      (C) That the rehabilitation agreement is null and void if the borrower fails to provide the documentation required to confirm the monthly payment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.

      (vii) If the borrower objects to the monthly payment amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the guaranty agency or its agents must recalculate the payment amount based solely on information provided on a form approved by the Secretary and, if requested, supporting documentation from the borrower and other sources, and must consider—

      (A) The borrower's, and if applicable, the spouse's current disposable income, including public assistance payments, and other income received by the borrower and the spouse, such as welfare benefits, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, and workers' compensation. Spousal income is not considered if the spouse does not contribute to the borrower's household income;

      (B) Family size as defined in § 682.215(a)(3); and

      (C) Reasonable and necessary expenses, which include—

      () Food;

      () Housing;

      () Utilities;

      () Basic communication expenses;

      () Necessary medical and dental costs;

      () Necessary insurance costs;

      () Transportation costs;

      () Dependent care and other work-related expenses;

      () Legally required child and spousal support;

      () Other title IV and non-title IV student loan payments; and

      () Other expenses approved by the Secretary.

      (viii) The guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a new written rehabilitation agreement confirming the borrower's recalculated reasonable and affordable payment amount within the timeframe specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the agency.

      (ix) The agency must include any payment made under § 682.401(b)(1) in determining whether the 9 out of 10 payments required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made.

      (x) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section.

      (xi) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, during the rehabilitation period, the guaranty agency must limit contact with the borrower on the loan being rehabilitated to collection activities that are required by law or regulation and to communications that support the rehabilitation.

      (2)(i) For the purposes of this section, payment in the full amount required means payment of an amount that is reasonable and affordable, based on the borrower's total financial circumstances, as agreed to by the borrower and the agency. Voluntary payments are those made directly by the borrower and do not include payments obtained by Federal offset, garnishment, income or asset execution, or after a judgment has been entered on a loan. A guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase the loan at the end of the 9- or 10-month payment period as applicable.

      (ii) If the guaranty agency has been unable to sell the loan, the guaranty agency must assign the loan to the Secretary.

      (3) Upon the sale of a rehabilitated loan to an eligible lender or assignment to the Secretary—

      (i) The guaranty agency must, within 45 days of the sale or assignment—

      (A) Provide notice to the prior holder of such sale or assignment, and

      (B) Request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported remove the record of default from the borrower's credit history.

      (ii) The prior holder of the loan must, within 30 days of receiving the notification from the guaranty agency, request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default claim payment or other equivalent record was reported remove such record from the borrower's credit history.

      (ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the loan, and any other loans held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for at least four years; for any subsequent fiscal year such loan must have been held by the agency for at least five years.

      (iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year.

      (iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the borrower.

      (2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a loan type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this section.

      (i)  A fiscal year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the amount collected on defaulted loans, including collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, PLUS, SLS, and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of that program (including payments received by the agency on loans under § 682.401(b)(1) and § 682.409 and the amounts of any loans purchased from the guaranty agency by an eligible lender) during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of principal and interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal year.

      (ii)  (A) If, in each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the fiscal year loan type recovery rate for a loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies.

      (iii)   (A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a sufficient amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year to equal or exceed the average rate of all agencies described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from the denominator of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the amount of these additional loans.

      (B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to include particular categories of loans that share characteristics that make the performance of the agency fall below the appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (iv)  The Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second quarterly report from all agencies, makes available to all agencies a mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies for each loan type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning of each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and the average rate for each loan type for the preceding fiscal year.

      (3)(i)  Upon petition by an agency submitted within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section only after review of the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary considers all relevant information available to him (including any information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in reviews of the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows:

      (A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate above the average rate of all active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active agencies.

      (B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with § 682.401(b)(1) and § 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be assigned.

      (C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include, but is not limited to the following:

      () The fiscal year loan type recovery rate within such school sectors as the Secretary may designate for the agency, and for all agencies.

      () The fiscal year loan type recovery rate for loans for the agency and for all agencies categorized by age of the loans as the Secretary may determine.

      () The performance of the agency, and all agencies, in default aversion.

      () The agency's performance on judgment enforcement.

      () The existence and use of any state or guaranty agency-specific collection tools.

      () The agency's level of compliance with §§ _6_82.409 and 682.410(b)(6).

      () Other factors that may affect loan repayment such as State or regional unemployment and natural disasters.

      (ii)  If the Secretary does not accept the agency's petition, the Secretary provides, in writing, to the agency the Secretary's reasons for concluding that the Federal fiscal interest is best protected by requiring the assignment.

      (b)(1) A guaranty agency that assigns a defaulted loan to the Secretary under this section thereby releases all rights and title to that loan. The Secretary does not pay the guaranty agency any compensation for a loan assigned under this section.

      (2) The guaranty agency does not share in any amounts received by the Secretary on a loan assigned under this section, regardless of the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan or the agency's previous collection costs.

      (c)(1) A guaranty agency must assign a loan to the Secretary under this section at the time, in the manner, and with the information and documentation that the Secretary requires. The agency must submit this information and documentation in the form (including magnetic media) and format specified by the Secretary.

      (2) The guaranty agency must execute an assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest in the promissory note or judgment evidencing a loan assigned under this section. If more than one loan is made under an MPN, the assignment of the note only applies to the loan or loans being assigned to the Secretary.

      (3) If the agency does not provide the required information and documentation in the form and format required by the Secretary, the Secretary may, at his option—

      (i) Allow the agency to revise the agency's submission to include the required information and documentation in the specified form and format;

      (ii) In the case of an improperly formatted computer tape, reformat the tape and assess the cost of the activity against the agency;

      (iii) Reorganize the material submitted and assess the cost of that activity against the agency; or

      (iv) Obtain from other agency records and add to the agency's submission any information from the original submission, and assess the cost of that activity against the agency.

      (4) For each loan assigned, the agency shall submit to the Secretary the following documents associated for each loan, assembled in the order listed below:

      (i) The original or a true and exact copy of the promissory note.

      (ii) Any documentation of a judgment entered on the loan.

      (iii) A written assignment of the loan or judgment, unless this assignment is affixed to the promissory note.

      (iv) The loan application, if a separate application was provided to the lender.

      (v) A payment history for the loan, as described in § 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(C).

      (vi) A collection history for the loan, as described in § 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(D).

      (vii) The record of the lender's disbursement of Stafford and PLUS loan funds to the school for delivery to the borrower.

      (viii) If the MPN or promissory note was signed electronically, the name and location of the entity in possession of the original electronic MPN or promissory note.

      (5) The agency may submit copies of required documents in lieu of originals.

      (6) The Secretary may accept the assignment of a loan without all of the documents listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If directed to do so, the agency must retain these documents for submission to the Secretary at some future date.

      (d)(1) If the Secretary determines that the agency has not submitted a document or record required by paragraph (c) of this section, and the Secretary decides to allow the agency an additional opportunity to submit the omitted document under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary notifies the agency and provides a reasonable period of time for the agency to submit the omitted record or document.

      (2) If the omitted document is not submitted within the time specified by the Secretary, the Secretary determines whether that omission impairs the Secretary's ability to collect the loan.

      (3) If the Secretary determines that the ability to collect the loan has been impaired under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary assesses the agency the amount paid to the agency under the reinsurance agreement and accrued interest at the rate applicable to the borrower under § 682.410(b)(3).

      (4) The Secretary reassigns to the agency that portion of the loan determined to be unenforceable by the Department.

      § 682.410   Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirements.

#### § § 682.410

      (a) —(1)  A guaranty agency shall establish and maintain a reserve fund to be used solely for its activities as a guaranty agency under the FFEL Program (“guaranty activities”). The guaranty agency shall credit to the reserve fund—

      (i) The total amount of insurance premiums and Federal default fees collected;

      (ii) Funds received from a State for the agency's guaranty activities, including matching funds under section 422(a) of the Act;

      (iii) Federal advances obtained under sections 422(a) and (c) of the Act;

      (iv) Federal payments for default, bankruptcy, death, disability, closed schools, and false certification claims;

      (v) Supplemental preclaims assistance payments;

      (vi) Transitional support payments received under section 458(a) of the Act;

      (vii) Funds collected by the guaranty agency on FFEL Program loans on which a claim has been paid;

      (viii) Investment earnings on the reserve fund; and

      (ix) Other funds received by the guaranty agency from any source for the agency's guaranty activities.

      (2)  A guaranty agency may use the assets of the reserve fund established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to pay only—

      (i) Insurance claims;

      (ii) Costs that are reasonable, as defined under § 682.410(a)(11)(iii), and that are ordinary and necessary for the agency to fulfill its responsibilities under the HEA, including costs of collecting loans, providing default aversion assistance, monitoring enrollment and repayment status, and carrying out any other guaranty activities. Those costs must be—

      (A) Allocable to the FFEL Program;

      (B) Not higher than the agency would incur under established policies, regulations, and procedures that apply to any comparable non-Federal activities of the guaranty agency;

      (C) Not included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally supported activity, except as specifically provided by Federal law;

      (D) Net of all applicable credits; and

      (E) Documented in accordance with applicable legal and accounting standards;

      (iii) The Secretary's equitable share of collections;

      (iv) Federal advances and other funds owed to the Secretary;

      (v) Reinsurance fees;

      (vi) Insurance premiums and Federal default fees related to cancelled loans;

      (vii) Borrower refunds, including those arising out of student or other borrower claims and defenses;

      (viii) (A) The repayment, on or after December 29, 1993, of amounts credited under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if the agency provides the Secretary 30 days prior notice of the repayment and demonstrates that—

      () These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation specifying that receipt was on a temporary basis only;

      () The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved; and

      () Repayment of these amounts would not cause the agency to fail to comply with the minimum reserve levels provided by paragraph (a)(10) of this section, except that the Secretary may, for good cause, provide written permission for a payment that meets the other requirements of this paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A).

      (B) The repayment, prior to December 29, 1993, of amounts credited under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if the agency demonstrates that—

      () These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation that receipt was on a temporary basis only; and

      () The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved.

      (ix) Any other costs or payments ordinary and necessary to perform functions directly related to the agency's responsibilities under the HEA and for their proper and efficient administration;

      (x) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any other payment that was allowed by law or regulation at the time it was made, if the agency acted in good faith when it made the payment or the agency would otherwise be unfairly prejudiced by the nonallowability of the payment at a later time; and

      (xi) Any other amounts authorized or directed by the Secretary.

      (3)  Except as approved by the Secretary, a guaranty agency shall credit the items listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to its reserve fund upon their receipt, without any deferral for accounting purposes, and shall deduct the items listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section from its reserve fund upon their payment, without any accrual for accounting purposes.

      (4)  (i) The accounting records of a guaranty agency must reflect the correct amount of sources and uses of funds under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii) A guaranty agency may reverse prior credits to its reserve fund if—

      (A) The agency gives the Secretary prior notice setting forth a detailed justification for the action;

      (B) The Secretary determines that such credits were made erroneously and in good faith; and

      (C) The Secretary determines that the action would not unfairly prejudice other parties.

      (iii) A guaranty agency shall correct any other errors in its accounting or reporting as soon as practicable after the errors become known to the agency.

      (iv) If a general reconstruction of a guaranty agency's historical accounting records is necessary to make a change under paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section or any other retroactive change to its accounting records, the agency may make this reconstruction only upon prior approval by the Secretary and without any deduction from its reserve fund for the cost of the reconstruction.

      (5)  The guaranty agency shall exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of investing the money of others when it invests the assets of the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It may invest these assets only in low-risk securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or a State.

      (6)  (i) If the guaranty agency uses in a substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities any funds required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve fund to develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a portion of the cost of developing and maintaining the developed asset to funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency to—

      (A) Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section; or

      (B) Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section so that—

      () If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the asset that are unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(_1_) of this section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair percentage of the total development cost of the asset paid with the reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve fund; or

      () If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair percentage of the fair market value or, in the case of a temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed for the unrelated use.

      (ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in that paragraph and makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, it shall correct the allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

      (7)  If the guaranty agency has any claim against any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, the claim is the property of the United States.

      (8)  All transactions between a guaranty agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds required to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve fund must be on terms that are not less advantageous to the reserve fund than would have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis by unrelated parties.

      (9)  The provisions of this § 682.410(a) define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of the Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant to section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.

      (10)  The guaranty agency must maintain a current minimum reserve level of not less than—

      (i) .5 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1993;

      (ii) .7 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1994;

      (iii) .9 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1995; and

      (iv) 1.1 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for each fiscal year of the agency that begins on or after January 1, 1996.

      (11)  For purposes of this section—

      (i)  means—

      (A) The total of reserve fund assets as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

      (B) Minus the total amount of the reserve fund assets used in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section; and

      (ii)  means—

      (A) The sum of—

      () The original principal amount of all loans guaranteed by the agency; and

      () The original principal amount of any loans on which the guarantee was transferred to the agency from another guarantor, excluding loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the agency;

      (B) Minus the original principal amount of all loans on which—

      () The loan guarantee was cancelled;

      () The loan guarantee was transferred to another agency;

      () Payment in full has been made by the borrower;

      () Reinsurance coverage has been lost and cannot be regained; and

      () The agency paid claims.

      (iii)  means a cost that, in its nature and amount, does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. The burden of proof is upon the guaranty agency, as a fiduciary under its agreements with the Secretary, to establish that costs are reasonable. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to—

      (A) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the proper and efficient performance and administration of the guaranty agency's responsibilities under the HEA;

      (B) The restraints or requirements imposed by factors such as sound business practices, arms-length bargaining, Federal, State, and other laws and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the guaranty agency's agreements with the Secretary; and

      (C) Market prices of comparable goods or services.

      (b) —(1)  The guaranty agency shall arrange for an independent financial and compliance audit of the agency's FFEL program as follows:

      (i) [Reserved]

      (ii) A guaranty agency must conduct an audit in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F—Audit Requirements.  If a nonprofit guaranty agency meets the criteria in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F—Audit Requirements to have a program specific audit, and chooses that option, the program-specific audit must meet the following requirements:

      (2)  (i) Whether or not provided for in the borrower's promissory note and subject to any limitation on the amount of those costs in that note, the guaranty agency may charge a borrower an amount equal to the reasonable costs incurred by the agency in collecting a loan on which the agency has paid a default or bankruptcy claim unless, within the 60-day period after the guaranty agency sends the initial notice described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, the borrower enters into an acceptable repayment agreement, including a rehabilitation agreement, and honors that agreement, in which case the guaranty agency must not charge a borrower any collection costs.

      (ii) An acceptable repayment agreement may include an agreement described in § 682.200(b) (Satisfactory repayment arrangement), § 682.405, or paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. An acceptable repayment agreement constitutes a repayment arrangement or agreement on repayment terms satisfactory to the guaranty agency, under this section.

      (iii) The costs under this paragraph (b)(2) include, but are not limited to, all attorneys' fees, collection agency charges, and court costs. Except as provided in §§ 682.401(b)(18)(i) and 682.405(b)(1)(vi)(B), the amount charged a borrower must equal the lesser of—

      (A) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of collection under the formula in 34 CFR 30.60; or

      (B) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of collection if the loan was held by the U.S. Department of Education.

      (3)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the guaranty agency shall charge the borrower interest on the amount owed by the borrower after the capitalization required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section has occurred at a rate that is the greater of—

      (A) The rate established by the terms of the borrower's original promissory note; or

      (B) In the case of a loan for which a judgment has been obtained, the rate provided for by State law.

      (ii) If the guaranty agency determines that the borrower is eligible for the interest rate limit of six percent under § 682.202(a)(8), the interest rate described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) shall not exceed six percent.

      (4)  The guaranty agency shall capitalize any unpaid interest due the lender from the borrower at the time the agency pays a default claim to the lender, but shall not capitalize any unpaid interest thereafter.

      (5)  (i) After the completion of the procedures in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the guaranty agency shall, after it has paid a default claim, report promptly, but not less than sixty days after completion of the procedures in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, and on a regular basis, to all nationwide consumer reporting agencies—

      (A) The total amount of loans made to the borrower and the remaining balance of those loans;

      (B) The date of default;

      (C) Information concerning collection of the loan, including the repayment status of the loan;

      (D) Any changes or corrections in the information reported by the agency that result from information received after the initial report; and

      (E) The date the loan is fully repaid by or on behalf of the borrower or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, total and permanent disability, or closed school or false certification.

      (ii) The guaranty agency, after it pays a default claim on a loan but before it reports the default to a consumer reporting agency or assesses collection costs against a borrower, shall, within the timeframe specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, provide the borrower with—

      (A) Written notice that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section regarding the proposed actions;

      (B) An opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the loan obligation;

      (C) An opportunity for an administrative review of the legal enforceability or past-due status of the loan obligation; and

      (D) An opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement on terms satisfactory to the agency.

      (iii) The procedures set forth in 34 CFR 30.20-30.33 (administrative offset) satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.

      (iv)(A) In response to a request submitted by a borrower, after the deadlines established under agency rules, for access to records, an administrative review, or for an opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement, the agency shall provide the requested relief but may continue reporting the debt to consumer reporting agencies until it determines that the borrower has demonstrated that the loan obligation is not legally enforceable or that alternative repayment arrangements satisfactory to the agency have been made with the borrower.

      (B) The deadline established by the agency for requesting administrative review under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section must allow the borrower at least 60 days from the date the notice described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is sent to request that review.

      (v) An agency may not permit an employee, official, or agent to conduct the administrative review required under this paragraph if that individual is—

      (A) Employed in an organizational component of the agency or its agent that is charged with collection of loan obligations; or

      (B) Compensated on the basis of collections on loan obligations.

      (vi) The notice sent by the agency under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section must—

      (A) Advise the borrower that the agency has paid a default claim filed by the lender and has taken assignment of the loan;

      (B) Identify the lender that made the loan and the school for attendance at which the loan was made;

      (C) State the outstanding principal, accrued interest, and any other charges then owing on the loan;

      (D) Demand that the borrower immediately begin repayment of the loan;

      (E) Explain the rate of interest that will accrue on the loan, that all costs incurred to collect the loan will be charged to the borrower, the authority for assessing these costs, and the manner in which the agency will calculate the amount of these costs;

      (F) Notify the borrower that the agency will report the default to all nationwide consumer reporting agencies to the detriment of the borrower's credit rating;

      (G) Explain the opportunities available to the borrower under agency rules to request access to the agency's records on the loan, to request an administrative review of the legal enforceability or past-due status of the loan, and to reach an agreement on repayment terms satisfactory to the agency to prevent the agency from reporting the loan as defaulted to consumer reporting agencies and provide deadlines and method for requesting this relief;

      (H) Unless the agency uses a separate notice to advise the borrower regarding other proposed enforcement actions, describe specifically any other enforcement action, such as offset against Federal or state income tax refunds or wage garnishment that the agency intends to use to collect the debt, and explain the procedures available to the borrower prior to those other enforcement actions for access to records, for an administrative review, or for agreement to alternative repayment terms;

      (I) Describe the grounds on which the borrower may object that the loan obligation as stated in the notice is not a legally enforceable debt owed by the borrower;

      (J) Describe any appeal rights available to the borrower from an adverse decision on administrative review of the loan obligation;

      (K) Describe any right to judicial review of an adverse decision by the agency regarding the legal enforceability or past-due status of the loan obligation;

      (L) Describe the collection actions that the agency may take in the future if those presently proposed do not result in repayment of the loan obligation, including the filing of a lawsuit against the borrower by the agency and assignment of the loan to the Secretary for the filing of a lawsuit against the borrower by the Federal Government; and

      (M) Inform the borrower of the options that are available to the borrower to remove the loan from default, including an explanation of the fees and conditions associated with each option.

      (vii) As part of the guaranty agency's response to a borrower who appeals an adverse decision resulting from the agency's administrative review of the loan obligation, the agency must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.

      (6)  (i) A guaranty agency must engage in reasonable and documented collection activities on a loan on which it pays a default claim filed by a lender. For a non-paying borrower, the agency must perform at least one activity every 180 days to collect the debt, locate the borrower (if necessary), or determine if the borrower has the means to repay the debt.

      (ii) Within 45 days after paying a lender's default claim, the agency must send a notice to the borrower that contains the information described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. During this time period, the agency also must notify the borrower, either in the notice containing the information described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, or in a separate notice, that if he or she does not make repayment arrangements acceptable to the agency, the agency will promptly initiate procedures to collect the debt. The agency's notification to the borrower must state that the agency may administratively garnish the borrower's wages, file a civil suit to compel repayment, offset the borrower's State and Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower, assign the loan to the Secretary in accordance with § 682.409, and take other lawful collection means to collect the debt, at the discretion of the agency. The agency's notification must include a statement that borrowers may have certain legal rights in the collection of debts, and that borrowers may wish to contact counselors or lawyers regarding those rights.

      (iii) Within a reasonable time after all of the information described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section has been sent, the agency must send at least one notice informing the borrower that the default has been reported to all nationwide consumer reporting agencies and that the borrower's credit rating may thereby have been damaged.

      (iv) The agency must send a notice informing the borrower of the options that are available to remove the loan from default, including an explanation of the fees and conditions associated with each option. This notice must be sent within a reasonable time after the end of the period for requesting an administrative review as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section or, if the borrower has requested an administrative review, within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the administrative review.

      (v) A guaranty agency must attempt an annual Federal offset against all eligible borrowers. If an agency initiates proceedings to offset a borrower's State or Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower, it may not initiate those proceedings sooner than 60 days after sending the notice described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.

      (vi) A guaranty agency must initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings against all eligible borrowers, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section, by following the procedures described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.

      (vii) A guaranty agency may file a civil suit against a borrower to compel repayment only if the borrower has no wages that can be garnished under paragraph (b)(9) of this section, or the agency determines that the borrower has sufficient attachable assets or income that is not subject to administrative wage garnishment that can be used to repay the debt, and the use of litigation would be more effective in collection of the debt.

      (viii) Upon notification by the Secretary that the borrower has made a borrower defense claim related to a loan that the borrower intends to consolidate into the Direct Loan Program for the purpose of seeking relief in accordance with § 685.212(k), the guaranty agency must suspend all collection activities on the affected loan for the period designated by the Secretary.

      (7)  (i) A guaranty agency may adopt a policy under which it pays a claim to a lender on a loan under the condition described in § 682.404(b)(3)(ii).

      (ii) Upon the payment of a claim under a policy described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, the guaranty agency shall—

      (A) Perform the loan servicing functions required of a lender under § 682.208, except that the agency is not required to follow the consumer reporting agency reporting requirements of that section;

      (B) Perform the functions of the lender during the repayment period of the loan, as required under § 682.209;

      (C) If the borrower is delinquent in repaying the loan at the time the agency pays a claim thereon to the lender or becomes delinquent while the agency holds the loan, exercise due diligence in accordance with § 682.411 in attempting to collect the loan from the borrower and any endorser or co-maker; and

      (D) After the date of default on the loan, if any, comply with paragraph (b)(6) of this section with respect to collection activities on the loan, with the date of default treated as the claim payment date for purposes of those paragraphs.

      (8)  The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (5), and (6) of this section preempt any State law, including State statutes, regulations, or rules, that would conflict with or hinder satisfaction of the requirements of these provisions.

      (9)  (i) If a guaranty agency decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it must do so in accordance with the following procedures:

      (A) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the guaranty agency must mail to the borrower's last known address, a written notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section.

      (B) The notice must describe—

      () The nature and amount of the debt;

      () The intention of the agency to collect the debt through deductions from disposable pay;

      () An explanation of the borrower's rights;

      () The deadlines by which a borrower must exercise those rights; and

      () The consequences of failure to exercise those rights in a timely manner.

      (C) The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt.

      (D) The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms agreeable to the agency.

      (E)() The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(F) through (J) of this section and other guidance provided by the Secretary, for any objection regarding the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt, and any objection that withholding from the borrower's disposable pay in the amount or at the rate proposed in the notice would cause financial hardship to the borrower.

      () The borrower must request a hearing in writing. At the borrower's option, the hearing may be oral or written. The time and location of the hearing is established by the guaranty agency. An oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. The agency notifies the borrower of the process for arranging the time and location of an oral hearing. All telephonic charges are the responsibility of the agency. All travel expenses incurred by the borrower in connection with an in-person oral hearing are the responsibility of the borrower.

      (F)() If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt—

      () The guaranty agency must prov_i_de evidence of the existence of the debt. If the agency provides evidence of the existence of the debt, the borrower must prove by the preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists, the debt is not enforceable under applicable law, the amount the guaranty agency claims the borrower owes is incorrect, including that any amount of collection costs assessed to the borrower exceeds the limits established under § 682.410(b)(2), or the debt is not delinquent; and

      () The borrower may ra_i_se any of the objections described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)()() of this section not raised in the written request, but must do so before a hearing is completed. For purposes of this paragraph, a hearing is completed when the record is closed and the hearing official notifies the parties that no additional evidence or objections will be accepted.

      () If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on an objection that withholding in the amount or at the rate that the agency proposed in its notice would cause financial hardship to the borrower and the borrower's spouse and dependents—

      () The borrower bears the burden of prov_i_ng the claim of financial hardship by a preponderance of the credible evidence by providing credible documentation that the amount of wages proposed in the notice would leave the borrower unable to meet basic living expenses of the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's dependents. The documentation must show the amount of the costs incurred for basic living expenses and the income available from any source to meet those expenses;

      () The borrower's claim of financial hardship must be evaluated by comparing the amounts that the borrower proves are being incurred for basic living expenses against the amounts spent for basic living expenses by families of the same size as the borrower's. For the purposes of this section, the standards published by the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. 7122(d)(2) (the ”Collection Financial Standards”) establish the average amounts spent for basic living expenses for families of the same size as the borrower's family;

      () The amount that the borrower proves is incurred for a type of basic living expense is considered to be reasonable to the extent that the amount does not exceed the amount spent for that expense by families of the same size according to the Collection Financial Standards. If the borrower claims an amount for any basic living expense that exceeds the amount in the Collection Financial Standards, the borrower must prove that the amount claimed is reasonable and necessary;

      () If the borrower's objection to the rate or amount proposed in the notice is upheld in part, the garnishment must be ordered at a lesser rate or amount, that is determined will allow the borrower to meet basic l_iv_ing expenses proven to be reasonable and necessary. If this financial hardship determination is made after a garnishment order is already in effect, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower's employer of any change required by the determination in the amount to be withheld or the rate of withholding under that order; and

      () A determination by a hearing official that financial hardship would result from garnishment is effecti_v_e for a period not longer than six months after the date of the finding. After this period, the guaranty agency may require the borrower to submit current information regarding the borrower's family income and living expenses. If the borrower fails to submit current information within 30 days of this request, or the guaranty agency concludes from a review of the available evidence that garnishment should now begin or the rate or the amount of an outstanding withholding should be increased, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower and provide the borrower with an opportunity to contest the determination and obtain a hearing on the objection under the procedures in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section.

      (G) If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency on or before the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the requested hearing and a decision has been rendered. The guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days.

      (H) If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency after the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. If a decision is not rendered within 60 days following receipt of a borrower's written request for a hearing, the guaranty agency must suspend the order beginning on the 61st day after the hearing request was received until a hearing is provided and a decision is rendered.

      (I) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law judge. Under no circumstance may the hearing official be under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency or of a third-party servicer or collection contractor employed by the agency. Payment of compensation by the guaranty agency, third-party servicer, or collection contractor employed by the agency to the hearing official for service as a hearing official does not constitute impermissible supervision or control under this paragraph. The guaranty agency must ensure that, except as needed to arrange for administrative matters pertaining to the hearing, including the type of hearing requested by the borrower, the time, place, and manner of conducting an oral hearing, and post-hearing matters such as issuance of a hearing decision, all oral communications between the hearing official and any representative of the guaranty agency or with the borrower are made within the hearing of the other party, and that copies of any written communication with either party are promptly provided to the other party. This paragraph does not preclude a hearing in the absence of one of the parties if the borrower is given proper notice of the hearing, both parties have agreed on the time, place, and manner of the hearing, and one of the parties fails to attend.

      (J) The hearing official must conduct any hearing as an informal proceeding, require witnesses in an oral hearing to testify under oath or affirmation, and maintain a summary record of any hearing. The hearing official must issue a final written decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request. However—

      () The borrower may request an extension of that deadline for a reasonable period, as determined by the hearing official, for the purpose of submitting additional evidence or raising a new objection described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)()() of this section; and

      () The agency may request, and the hearing official must grant, a reasonable extension of time sufficient to enable the guaranty agency to evaluate and respond to any such additional evidence or any objections raised pursuant to paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)()() of this section.

      (K) An employer served with a garnishment order from the guaranty agency with respect to a borrower whose wages are not then subject to a withholding order of any kind must deduct and pay to the agency from a borrower's disposable pay an amount that does not exceed the smallest of—

      () The amount specified in the guaranty agency order;

      () The amount permitted by section 488A(a)(1) of the Act, which is 15 percent of the borrower's disposable pay; or

      () The amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 167_3_(a)(2), which is the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage.

      (L) If a borrower's pay is subject to more than one garnishment order—

      () Unless other Federal law requires a different priority, the employer must pay the agency the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(K) of this section before the employer complies with any later garnishment orders, except a family support withholding order;

      () If an employer is withholding from a borrower's pay based on a garnishment order served on the employer before the guaranty agency's order, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the employer must comply with the agency's garnishment order by withholding an amount that is the lesser of—

      () The amount spec_i_fied in the guaranty agency order; or

      () The amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(L)() of this section less the amount or amounts withheld under the garnishment order or orders that have priority over the agency's order; and

      () The cumulative withholding for all garnishment orders issued by guaranty agencies may not exceed, for an individual borrower, the amount permitted by _1_5 U.S.C. 167_3_, which is the lesser of _2_5 percent of the borrower's disposable pay or the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage. If a borrower owes debts to one or more guaranty agencies, each agency may issue a garnishment order to enforce each of those debts, but no single agency may order a total amount exceeding 15 percent of the disposable pay of a borrower to be withheld. The employer must honor these orders as provided in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(L)() and () of this section.

      (M) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(K) and (L) of this section, an employer may withhold and pay a greater amount than required under the order if the borrower gives the employer written consent.

      (N) A borrower may, at any time, raise an objection to the amount or the rate of withholding specified in the guaranty agency's order to the borrower's employer on the ground of financial hardship. However, the guaranty agency is not required to consider such an objection and provide the borrower with a hearing until at least six months after the agency issued the most recent garnishment order, either one for which the borrower did not request a hearing or one that was issued after a hardship-related hearing determination. The agency may provide a hearing in extraordinary circumstances earlier than six months if the borrower's request for review shows that the borrower's financial circumstances have substantially changed after the garnishment notice because of an event such as injury, divorce, or catastrophic illness.

      (O) A garnishment order is effective until the guaranty agency rescinds the order or the agency has fully recovered the amounts owed by the borrower, including interest, late fees, and collections costs. If an employer is unable to honor a garnishment order because the amount available for garnishment is insufficient to pay any portion of the amount stated in the order, the employer must notify the agency and comply with the order when sufficient disposable pay is available. Upon full recovery of the debt, the agency must send the borrower's employer notification to stop wage withholding.

      (P) The guaranty agency must sue any employer for any amount that the employer, after receipt of the withholding order provided by the agency under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section, fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal pay and disbursement cycle.

      (Q) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The borrower has the burden of informing the guaranty agency of the circumstances surrounding the borrower's involuntary separation from employment.

      (R) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it must send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.

      (S) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section must contain only the information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order and to ensure proper credit for payments received. At a minimum, the notice given to the employer includes the borrower's name, address, and Social Security Number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where the employer must send payments.

      (T)() A guaranty agency may use a third-party servicer or collection contractor to perform administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment, but may not allow such a party to conduct required hearings or to determine that a withholding order is to be issued. Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(T)() and () of this section, administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment may include but are not limited to—

      () Ident_i_fying to the agency suitable candidates for wage garnishment pursuant to agency standards;

      () Obtaining employment information for the purposes of garnishment;

      () Sending candidates selected for garnishment by the agency notices prescribed by the agency;

      () Negotiating alternat_iv_e repayment arrangements with borrowers;

      () Responding to inquiries from notified borrowers;

      () Recei_vi_ng garnishment payments on behalf of the agency;

      () Arranging for the retention of hearing officials and for the conduct of hearings on behalf of the agency;

      () Providing information to borrowers or hearing officials on the process or conduct of hearings; and

      () Sending garnishment orders and other communications to employers on behalf of the agency.

      () Only an authorized official of the agency may determine that an individual withholding order is to be issued. The guarantor must record the official's determination for each order it issues, including any order which it causes to be prepared or mailed by a third-party servicer or collection contractor. The guarantor must evidence the official's approval, either by including the official's signature on the order or, if the agency uses a form of withholding order that does not provide for execution by signature, by retaining in the agency's records the identity of the approving official, the date of the approval, the amount or rate of the order, the name and address of the employer to whom the order was issued, and the debt for which the order was issued.

      () The withholding order must identify the guaranty agency as the holder of the debt, as the issuer of the order, and as the sole party legally authorized to issue the withholding order. If a guaranty agency uses a third-party servicer or collection contractor to prepare and mail a withholding order that includes the name of the servicer or contractor that prepared or mailed the order, the guaranty agency must also ensure that the order contains no captions or representations that the servicer or contractor is the party that issued, or was empowered by Federal law or by the agency to issue, the withholding order.

      (U) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the Act, the borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order.

      (V) A guaranty agency is required to suspend a garnishment order when the agency receives a borrower's fifth qualifying payment under a loan rehabilitation agreement with the agency, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, in accordance with § 682.405(a)(3).

      (ii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(9) of this section—

      (A) “Borrower” includes all endorsers on a loan;

      (B) “Day” means calendar day;

      (C) “Disposable pay” means that part of a borrower's compensation for personal services, whether or not denominated as wages from an employer, that remains after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld, and includes, but is not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, or vacation pay. “Amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as Social Security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld under a court order or other withholding order. All references to an amount of disposable pay refer to disposable pay calculated for a single week;

      (D) “Employer” means a person or entity that employs the services of another and that pays the latter's wages or salary and includes, but is not limited to, State and local governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government;

      (E) “Financial hardship” means an inability to meet basic living expenses for goods and services necessary for the survival of the borrower and the borrower's spouse and dependents;

      (F) “Garnishment” means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and paying those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order; and

      (G) “Withholding order” means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by the guaranty agency and may also be referred to as “wage garnishment order” or “garnishment order.”

      (10)  (i) A guaranty agency shall maintain and enforce written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts or agreements. The standards of conduct must, at a minimum, require disclosure of financial or other interests and must mandate disinterested decision-making. The standards must provide for appropriate disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of the standards by employees, officers, directors, trustees, or agents of the guaranty agency, and must include provisions to—

      (A) Prohibit any employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent from participating in the selection, award, or decision-making related to the administration of a contract or agreement supported by the reserve fund described in paragraph (a) of this section, if that participation would create a conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent, or any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of those parties has a financial or ownership interest in the organization selected for an award or would benefit from the decision made in the administration of the contract or agreement. The prohibitions described in this paragraph do not apply to employees of a State agency covered by codes of conduct established under State law;

      (B) Ensure sufficient separation of responsibility and authority between its lender claims processing as a guaranty agency and its lending or loan servicing activities, or both, within the guaranty agency or between that agency and one or more affiliates, including independence in direct reporting requirements and such management and systems controls as may be necessary to demonstrate, in the independent audit required under § 682.410(b)(1), that claims filed by another arm of the guaranty agency or by an affiliate of that agency receive no more favorable treatment than that accorded the claims filed by a lender or servicer that is not an affiliate or part of the guaranty agency; and

      (C) Prohibit the employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents of the guaranty agency, his or her partner, or any member of his or her immediate family, from soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to agreements, except that nominal and unsolicited gratuities, favors, or items may be accepted.

      (ii)  If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest because of an agency's failure to meet the requirements of § 682.410(b)(10)(i), the Secretary may require the agency to comply with any additional measures that the Secretary believes are appropriate, including the total divestiture of the agency's non-FFEL functions and the agency's interests in any affiliated organization.

      (c)  A guaranty agency shall take such measures and establish such controls as are necessary to ensure its vigorous enforcement of all Federal, State, and guaranty agency requirements, including agreements, applicable to its loan guarantee program, including, at a minimum, the following:

      (1) Conducting comprehensive biennial on-site program reviews, using statistically valid techniques to calculate liabilities to the Secretary that each review indicates may exist, of at least—

      (i)(A) Each participating lender whose dollar volume of FFEL loans held by the lender and guaranteed by the agency in the preceding year—

      () Equaled or exceeded two percent of the total of all loans guaranteed by the agency;

      () Was one of the ten largest lenders whose loans were guaranteed by the agency; or

      () Equaled or exceeded $10 million in the most recent fiscal year;

      (B) Each lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) or (J) of the Act that is located in any State in which the agency is the principal guarantor, and, at the option of each guaranty agency, the Student Loan Marketing Association; and

      (C) Each school that participated in the guaranty agency's program, located in a State for which the guaranty agency is the principal guaranty agency, that has a cohort default rate, as described in subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, that includes FFEL Program loans, for either of the 2 immediately preceding fiscal years, as defined in 34 CFR 668.182, that exceeds 20 percent, unless the school is under a mandate from the Secretary under subpart M of 34 CFR part 668 to take specific default reduction measures or if the total dollar amount of loans entering repayment in each fiscal year on which the cohort default rate of over 20 percent is based does not exceed $100,000; or

      (ii) The schools and lenders selected by the agency as an alternative to the reviews required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)-(C) of this section if the Secretary approves the agency's proposed alternative selection methodology.

      (2) Demanding prompt repayment by the responsible parties to lenders, borrowers, the agency, or the Secretary, as appropriate, of all funds found in those reviews to be owed by the participants with regard to loans guaranteed by the agency, whether or not the agency holds the loans, and monitoring the implementation by participants of corrective actions, including these repayments, required by the agency as a result of those reviews.

      (3) Referring to the Secretary for further enforcement action any case in which repayment of funds to the Secretary is not made in full within 60 days of the date of the agency's written demand to the school, lender, or other party for payment, together with all supporting documentation, any correspondence, and any other documentation submitted by that party regarding the repayment.

      (4) Undertaking or arranging with State or local law enforcement agencies for the prompt and thorough investigation of all allegations and indications of criminal or other programmatic misconduct by its program participants, including violations of Federal law or regulations.

      (5) Promptly referring to appropriate State and local regulatory agencies and to nationally recognized accrediting agencies and associations for investigation information received by the guaranty agency that may affect the retention or renewal of the license or accreditation of a program participant.

      (6) Promptly reporting all of the allegations and indications of misconduct having a substantial basis in fact, and the scope, progress, and results of the agency's investigations thereof to the Secretary.

      (7) Referring appropriate cases to State or local authorities for criminal prosecution or civil litigation.

      (8) Promptly notifying the Secretary of—

      (i) Any action it takes affecting the FFEL program eligibility of a participating lender or title IV eligibility of a school;

      (ii) Information it receives regarding an action affecting the FFEL program eligibility of a participating lender or title IV eligibility of a school taken by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, association, or a State licensing agency;

      (iii) Any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to the enforceability of FFEL loans guaranteed by the agency or in which tuition obligations of a school's students are directly at issue, other than a proceeding relating to a single borrower or student; and

      (iv) Any petition for relief in bankruptcy, application for receivership, or corporate dissolution proceeding brought by or against a school or lender participating in its loan guarantee program.

      (9) Cooperating with all program reviews, investigations, and audits conducted by the Secretary relating to the agency's loan guarantee program.

      (10) Taking prompt action to protect the rights of borrowers and the Federal fiscal interest respecting loans that the agency has guaranteed when the agency learns that a school that participated in the FFEL Program or a holder of loans participating in the program is experiencing problems that threaten the solvency of the school or holder, including—

      (i) Conducting on-site program reviews;

      (ii) Providing training and technical assistance, if appropriate;

      (iii) Filing a proof of claim with a bankruptcy court for recovery of any funds due the agency and any refunds due to borrowers on FFEL loans that it has guaranteed when the agency learns that a school has filed a bankruptcy petition;

      (iv) Promptly notifying the Secretary that the agency has determined that a school or holder of loans is experiencing potential solvency problems; and

      (v) Promptly notifying the Secretary of the results of any actions taken by the agency to protect Federal funds involving such a school or holder.

> [57 FR 60323, Dec. 18, 1992]

      § 682.411   Lender due diligence in collecting guaranty agency loans.

#### § § 682.411

      (a)  In the event of delinquency on an FFEL Program loan, the lender must engage in at least the collection efforts described in paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section, except that in the case of a loan made to a borrower who is incarcerated, residing outside a State, Mexico, or Canada, or whose telephone number is unknown, the lender may send a forceful collection letter instead of each telephone effort required by this section.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, delinquency on a loan begins on the first day after the due date of the first missed payment that is not later made. The due date of the first payment is established by the lender but must occur by the deadlines specified in § 682.209(a) or, if the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has entered the repayment period, no later than 75 days after the day the lender so learns, except as provided in § 682.209(a)(2)(v) and (a)(3)(ii)(E). If a payment is made late, the first day of delinquency is the day after the due date of the next missed payment that is not later made. A payment that is within five dollars of the amount normally required to advance the due date may nevertheless advance the due date if the lender's procedures allow for that advancement.

      (2) At no point during the periods specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section may the lender permit the occurrence of a gap in collection activity, as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, of more than 45 days (60 days in the case of a transfer).

      (3) As part of one of the collection activities provided for in this section, the lender must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.

      (c)  Except in the case in which a loan is brought into this period by a payment on the loan, expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, or the lender's receipt from the drawee of a dishonored check submitted as a payment on the loan, the lender during this period must send at least one written notice or collection letter to the borrower informing the borrower of the delinquency and urging the borrower to make payments sufficient to eliminate the delinquency. The notice or collection letter sent during this period must include, at a minimum, a lender or servicer contact, a telephone number, and a prominent statement informing the borrower that assistance may be available if he or she is experiencing difficulty in making a scheduled repayment.

Collection letters sent during this period must include, at a minimum, information for the borrower regarding deferment, forbearance, income-sensitive repayment, income-based repayment and loan consolidation, and other available options to avoid default.

      (2) At least two of the collection letters required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that, if the loan is not paid, the lender will assign the loan to the guaranty agency that, in turn, will report the default to each nationwide consumer reporting agency, and that the agency may institute proceedings to offset the borrower's State and Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower or to garnish the borrower's wages, or to assign the loan to the Federal Government for litigation against the borrower.

      (3) Following the lender's receipt of a payment on the loan or a correct address for the borrower, the lender's receipt from the drawee of a dishonored check received as a payment on the loan, the lender's receipt of a correct telephone number for the borrower, or the expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, the lender is required to engage in only—

      (i) Two diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone during this period, if the loan is less than 91 days delinquent (121 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or forbearance; or

      (ii) One diligent effort to contact the borrower by telephone during this period if the loan is 91-120 days delinquent (121-180 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or forbearance.

      (4) A lender need not attempt to contact by telephone any borrower who is more than 120 days delinquent (180 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequent than monthly) following the lender's receipt of—

      (e)  During this period the lender must engage in efforts to urge the borrower to make the required payments on the loan. These efforts must, at a minimum, provide information to the borrower regarding options to avoid default and the consequences of defaulting on the loan.

      (f)  On or after the 241st day of delinquency (the 301st day for loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) the lender must send a final demand letter to the borrower requiring repayment of the loan in full and notifying the borrower that a default will be reported to each nationwide consumer reporting agency. The lender must allow the borrower at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond to the final demand letter and to bring the loan out of default before filing a default claim on the loan.

      (g)  Upon completion of a diligent but unsuccessful effort to ascertain the correct telephone number of a borrower as required by paragraph (m) of this section, the lender is excused from any further efforts to contact the borrower by telephone, unless the borrower's number is obtained before the 211th day of delinquency (the 271st day for loans repayable in installments less frequently than monthly).

      (h)  (1) Unless the letter specified under paragraph (f) of this section has already been sent, within 10 days of its receipt of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current address, the lender must begin to diligently attempt to locate the borrower through the use of effective commercial skip-tracing techniques. These efforts must include, but are not limited to, sending a letter to or making a diligent effort to contact each endorser, relative, reference, individual, and entity, identified in the borrower's loan file, including the schools the student attended. For this purpose, a lender's contact with a school official who might reasonably be expected to know the borrower's address may be with someone other than the financial aid administrator, and may be in writing or by phone calls. These efforts must be completed by the date of default with no gap of more than 45 days between attempts to contact those individuals or entities.

      (2) Upon receipt of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current address, the lender must discontinue the collection efforts described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.

      (3) If the lender is unable to ascertain the borrower's current address despite its performance of the activities described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the lender is excused thereafter from performance of the collection activities described in paragraphs (c) through (f) and (l)(1) through (l)(3) and (l)(5) of this section unless it receives communication indicating the borrower's address before the 241st day of delinquency (the 301st day for loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly).

      (4) The activities specified by paragraph (m)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section (with references to the “borrower” understood to mean endorser, reference, relative, individual, or entity as appropriate) meet the requirement that the lender make a diligent effort to contact each individual identified in the borrower's loan file.

      (i)  Not earlier than the 60th day and no later than the 120th day of delinquency, a lender must request default aversion assistance from the guaranty agency that guarantees the loan.

      (j)  For purposes of this section, the term  means, with respect to a loan, any period—

      (l)  For purposes of this section, the term  with respect to a loan means—

      (iii) For any period in which the lender or servicer, with respect to the loan, violates the requirements of subpart C of this part; and

The hearing is at a time and in a manner the Secretary determines to be appropriate to the resolution of the issues on which the lender, agency, or servicer requests the hearing.

      (ii) The Secretary's decision to terminate a guaranty agency's participation in the FFEL Program after September 24, 1998 does not become final until the Secretary provides the agency with written notice of the intended action and provides an opportunity for a hearing on the record.

      (2)(i) The Secretary may withhold payments from an agency or suspend an agreement with an agency prior to giving notice and an opportunity to be heard if the Secretary finds that emergency action is necessary to prevent substantial harm to Federal interests.

      (ii) The Secretary follows the notice and show cause procedures described in § 682.704 applicable to emergency actions against lenders in taking an emergency action against a guaranty agency.

The Secretary's waiver policy for violations of § 682.406(a)(3) or (a)(5) is set forth in appendix D to this part.

      (g) The Secretary's final decision to require repayment of funds or to take other remedial action, other than a fine, against a lender or guaranty agency under this section is conclusive and binding on the lender or agency.

      (h) In any action to require repayment of funds or to withhold funds from a guaranty agency, or to limit, suspend, or terminate a guaranty agency based on a violation of section 428(b)(3) of the Act, if the Secretary finds that the guaranty agency provided or offered the prohibited payments or activities, the Secretary applies a rebuttable presumption that the payments or activities were offered or provided to secure applications for FFEL loans or to secure FFEL loan volume. To reverse the presumption, the guaranty agency must present evidence that the activities or payments were provided for a reason unrelated to securing applications for FFEL loans or securing FFEL loan volume.

      § 682.417   Determination of Federal funds or assets to be returned.

#### § § 682.417

      (a)  The procedures described in this section apply to a determination by the Secretary that—

      (1) A guaranty agency must return to the Secretary a portion of its Federal Fund that the Secretary has determined is unnecessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency; and

      (2) A guaranty agency must require the return to the agency or the Secretary of Federal funds or assets within the meaning of section 422(g)(1) of the Act held by or under the control of any other entity that the Secretary determines are necessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency or that are required for the orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary may initiate a process to recover unnecessary Federal funds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency's Federal Fund ratio under § 682.410(a)(10) for each of the two preceding Federal fiscal years exceeded 2.0 percent.

      (2) If the Secretary initiates a process to recover unnecessary Federal funds, the Secretary requires the return of a portion of the Federal funds that the Secretary determines will permit the agency to—

      (i) Have a Federal Fund ratio of at least 2.0 percent under § 682.410(a)(10) at the time of the determination; and

      (ii) Meet the minimum Federal Fund requirements under § 682.410(a)(10) and retain sufficient additional Federal funds to perform its responsibilities as a guaranty agency during the current Federal fiscal year and the four succeeding Federal fiscal years.

      (3)(i) The Secretary makes a determination of the amount of Federal funds needed by the guaranty agency under paragraph (b)(2) of this section on the basis of financial projections for the period described in that paragraph. If the agency provides projections for a period longer than the period referred to in that paragraph, the Secretary may consider those projections.

      (ii) The Secretary may require a guaranty agency to provide financial projections in a form and on the basis of assumptions prescribed by the Secretary. If the Secretary requests the agency to provide financial projections, the agency must provide the projections within 60 days of the Secretary's request. If the agency does not provide the projections within the specified time period, the Secretary determines the amount of Federal funds needed by the agency on the basis of other information.

      (c)  (1) The Secretary or an authorized Departmental official begins a proceeding to order a guaranty agency to return a portion of its Federal funds, or to direct the return of Federal funds or assets subject to return, by sending the guaranty agency a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested.

      (2) The notice—

      (i) Informs the guaranty agency of the Secretary's determination that Federal funds or assets must be returned;

      (ii) Describes the basis for the Secretary's determination and contains sufficient information to allow the guaranty agency to prepare and present an appeal;

      (iii) States the date by which the return of Federal funds or assets must be completed;

      (iv) Describes the process for appealing the determination, including the time for filing an appeal and the procedure for doing so; and

      (v) Identifies any actions that the guaranty agency must take to ensure that the Federal funds or assets that are the subject of the notice are maintained and protected against use, expenditure, transfer, or other disbursement after the date of the Secretary's determination, and the basis for requiring those actions. The actions may include, but are not limited to, directing the agency to place the Federal funds in an escrow account. If the Secretary has directed the guaranty agency to require the return of Federal funds or assets held by or under the control of another entity, the guaranty agency must ensure that the agency's claims to those funds or assets and the collectability of the agency's claims will not be compromised or jeopardized during an appeal. The guaranty agency must also comply with all other applicable regulations relating to the use of Federal funds and assets.

      (d)  (1) A guaranty agency may appeal the Secretary's determination that Federal funds or assets must be returned by filing a written notice of appeal within 20 days of the date of the guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination. If the agency files a notice of appeal, the requirement that the return of Federal funds or assets be completed by a particular date is suspended pending completion of the appeal process. If the agency does not file a notice of appeal within the period specified in this paragraph, the Secretary's determination is final.

      (2) A guaranty agency must submit the information described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section within 45 days of the date of the guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination unless the Secretary agrees to extend the period at the agency's request. If the agency does not submit that information within the prescribed period, the Secretary's determination is final.

      (3) A guaranty agency's appeal of a determination that Federal funds or assets must be returned is considered and decided by a Departmental official other than the official who issued the determination or a subordinate of that official.

      (4) In an appeal of the Secretary's determination, the guaranty agency must—

      (i) State the reasons the guaranty agency believes the Federal funds or assets need not be returned;

      (ii) Identify any evidence on which the guaranty agency bases its position that Federal funds or assets need not be returned;

      (iii) Include copies of the documents that contain this evidence;

      (iv) Include any arguments that the guaranty agency believes support its position that Federal funds or assets need not be returned; and

      (v) Identify the steps taken by the guaranty agency to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.

      (5)(i) In its appeal, the guaranty agency may request the opportunity to make an oral argument to the deciding official for the purpose of clarifying any issues raised by the appeal. The deciding official provides this opportunity promptly after the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (ii) The agency may not submit new evidence at or after the oral argument unless the deciding official determines otherwise. A transcript of the oral argument is made a part of the record of the appeal and is promptly provided to the agency.

      (6) The guaranty agency has the burden of production and the burden of persuading the deciding official that the Secretary's determination should be modified or withdrawn.

      (e)  (1) If the Secretary issues a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary promptly publishes a notice in the  announcing the portion of the Federal Fund to be returned by the agency and providing interested persons an opportunity to submit written information relating to the determination within 30 days after the date of publication. The Secretary publishes the notice no earlier than five days after the agency receives a copy of the determination.

      (2) If the guaranty agency to which the determination relates files a notice of appeal of the determination, the deciding official may consider any information submitted in response to the  notice. All information submitted by a third party is available for inspection and copying at the offices of the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., during normal business hours.

      (f)  If the deciding official considers information in addition to the evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's determination that is adverse to the guaranty agency's position on appeal, the deciding official informs the agency and provides it a reasonable opportunity to respond to the information without regard to the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (g)  (1) The deciding official issues a written decision on the guaranty agency's appeal within 45 days of the date on which the information described in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section is received, or the oral argument referred to in paragraph (d)(5) of this section is held, whichever is later. The deciding official mails the decision to the guaranty agency by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision of the deciding official becomes the final decision of the Secretary 30 days after the deciding official issues it. In the case of a determination that a guaranty agency must return Federal funds, if the deciding official does not issue a decision within the prescribed period, the agency is no longer required to take the actions described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.

      (2) A guaranty agency may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination to require the return of Federal funds or assets until the deciding official issues a decision.

      (3) The deciding official's written decision includes the basis for the decision. The deciding official bases the decision only on evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's determination and on information properly submitted and considered by the deciding official under this section. The deciding official is bound by all applicable statutes and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them invalid.

      (h)  (1) If the deciding official's final decision requires the guaranty agency to return Federal funds, or requires the guaranty agency to require the return of Federal funds or assets to the agency or to the Secretary, the decision states a new date for compliance with the decision. The new date is no earlier than the date on which the decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary.

      (2) If the guaranty agency fails to comply with the decision, the Secretary may recover the Federal funds from any funds due the agency from the Department without any further notice or procedure and may take any other action permitted or authorized by law to compel compliance.

      (a) A school shall certify that the information it provides in connection with a loan application about the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower, the student for whom the loan is intended, is complete and accurate. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E, a school may rely in good faith upon statements made by the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower of a PLUS loan, the student and the parent borrower.

      (b) The information to be provided by the school about the borrower pertains to—

      (1) The borrower's eligibility for a loan, as determined in accordance with § 682.201 and § 682.204;

      (2) For a subsidized Stafford loan, the student's eligibility for interest benefits as determined in accordance with § 682.301; and

      (3) The schedule for disbursement of the loan proceeds, which must reflect the delivery of the loan proceeds as set forth in section 428G of the Act.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in certifying a loan, a school must certify a loan for the lesser of the borrower's request or the loan limits determined under § 682.204.

      (d) Before certifying a PLUS loan application for a graduate or professional student borrower, the school must determine the borrower's eligibility for a Stafford loan. If the borrower is eligible for a Stafford loan but has not requested the maximum Stafford loan amount for which the borrower is eligible, the school must—

      (1) Notify the graduate or professional student borrower of the maximum Stafford loan amount that he or she is eligible to receive and provide the borrower with a comparison of—

      (i) The maximum interest rate for a Stafford loan and the maximum interest rate for a PLUS loan;

      (ii) Periods when interest accrues on a Stafford loan and periods when interest accrues on a PLUS loan; and

      (iii) The point at which a Stafford loan enters repayment and the point at which a PLUS loan enters repayment; and

      (2) Give the graduate or professional student borrower the opportunity to request the maximum Stafford loan amount for which the borrower is eligible.

      (e) A school may not certify a Stafford or PLUS loan, or a combination of loans, for a loan amount that—

      (1) The school has reason to know would result in the borrower exceeding the annual or maximum loan amounts in § 682.204; or

      (2) Exceeds the student's estimated cost of attendance for the period of enrollment, less—

      (i) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; and

      (ii) In the case of a Subsidized Stafford loan, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.

      (f)(1)(i) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may certify a loan application is—

      (A) At a school that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or has terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, a single term (e.g., a semester or quarter); or

      (B) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, at a school that measures academic progress in clock hours, or measures academic progress in credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system and does not have terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, the lesser of—

      () The length of the student's program (or the remaining portion of that program if the student has less than the full program remaining) at the school; or

      () The academic year as defined by the school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.3.

      (ii) For a student who transfers into a school with credit or clock hours from another school, and the prior school certified or originated a loan for a period of enrollment that overlaps the period of enrollment at the new school, the new school may certify a loan for the remaining portion of the program or academic year. In this case the school may certify a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit.

      (iii) For a student who completes a program at a school, where the student's last loan to complete that program had been for less than an academic year, and the student then begins a new program at the same school, the school may certify a loan for the remainder of the academic year. In this case the school may certify a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the loan level associated with the new program.

      (2) May not, for first-time borrowers, assign through award packaging or other methods, a borrower's loan to a particular lender;

      (3) May refuse to certify a Stafford or PLUS loan or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the loan if the reason for that action is documented and provided to the borrower in writing, provided that—

      (i) The determination is made on a case-by-case basis; and

      (ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in the student's file; and

      (4) May not, under paragraph (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, engage in any pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to FFEL loans because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, handicapped status, income, or selection of a particular lender or guaranty agency.

      (g) The maximum period for which a school may certify a loan application is—

      (1) Generally an academic year, as defined by 34 CFR 668.3, except that a guaranty agency may allow a school to use a longer period of time, corresponding to the period to which the agency applies the annual loan limits; or

      (2) For a defaulted borrower who has regained eligibility under § 682.401(b)(1), the academic year in which the borrower regained eligibility.

      (h) In certifying a Stafford or Unsubsidized Stafford loan amount in accordance with § 682.204—

      (1) A program of study must be considered at least one full academic year if—

      (i) The number of weeks of instructional time is at least 30 weeks; and

      (2) A program of study must be considered two-thirds (2/3) of an academic year if—

      (i) The number of weeks of instructional time is at least 20 weeks; and

      (ii) The number of clock hours is at least 600, the number of semester or trimester hours is at least 16, or the number of quarter hours is at least 24;

      (3) A program of study must be considered one-third ( ) of an academic year if—

      (i) The number of weeks of instructional time is at least 10 weeks; and

      (ii) The number of clock hours is at least 300, the number of semester or trimester hours is at least 8, or the number of quarter hours is at least 12; and

      (4) In prorating a loan amount for a student enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, the school need not recalculate the amount of the loan if the number of hours for which an eligible student is enrolled changes after the school certifies the loan.

      (i)(1) If a school measures academic progress in an educational program in credit hours and uses either standard terms (semesters, trimesters, or quarters) or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length, and each term is at least nine weeks of instructional time in length, a student is considered to have completed an academic year and progresses to the next annual loan limit when the academic year calendar period has elapsed.

      (2) If a school measures academic progress in an educational program in credit hours and uses nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length or each term is not at least nine weeks of instructional time in length, or measures academic progress in credit hours and does not have academic terms, a student is considered to have completed an academic year and progresses to the next annual loan limit at the later of—

      (i) The student's completion of the weeks of instructional time in the student's academic year; or

      (ii) The date, as determined by the school, that the student has successfully completed the academic coursework in the student's academic year.

      (3) If a school measures academic progress in an educational program in clock hours, a student is considered to have completed an academic year and progresses to the next annual loan limit at the later of—

      (i) The student's completion of the weeks of instructional time in the student's academic year; or

      (ii) The date, as determined by the school, that the student has successfully completed the clock hours in the student's academic year.

      (4) For purposes of this section, terms in a loan period are substantially equal in length if no term in the loan period is more than two weeks of instructional time longer than any other term in that loan period.

      (j)(1) A school must cease certifying loans based on the exceptions in section 428G(a)(3) of the Act no later than—

      (i) 30 days after the date the school receives notification from the Secretary of an FFEL cohort default rate, calculated under subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, that causes the school to no longer meet the qualifications outlined in those paragraphs; or

      (ii) October 1, 2002.

      (2) A school must cease certifying loans based on the exceptions in section 428G(a)(3) of the Act no later than 30 days after the date the school receives notification from the Secretary of an FFEL cohort default rate, calculated under subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, that causes the school to no longer meet the qualifications outlined in those paragraphs.

      (k) A school may not assess the borrower, or the student in the case of a parent PLUS loan, a fee for the completion or certification of any FFEL Program form or information or for providing any information necessary for a student or parent to receive a loan under part B of the Act or any benefits associated with such a loan.

      (l) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a school may not request the disbursement by the lender for loan proceeds earlier than the period specified in 34 CFR 668.167.

#### § § 682.604

      (a)  (1) A school must ensure that exit counseling is conducted with each Stafford Loan borrower and graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower either in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the school must ensure that this counseling is conducted shortly before the student borrower ceases at least half-time study at the school, and that an individual with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program that the home institution approves for credit, written counseling materials may be provided by mail within 30 days after the student borrower completes the program. If a student borrower withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or fails to complete an exit counseling session as required, the school must, within 30 days after learning that the student borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to complete the exit counseling as required, ensure that exit counseling is provided through interactive electronic means, by mailing written counseling materials to the student borrower at the student borrower's last known address, or by sending written counseling materials to an email address provided by the student borrower that is not an email address associated with the school sending the counseling materials.

      (2) The exit counseling must—

      (i) Inform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower's indebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have obtained Stafford loans, PLUS Loans, or student borrowers who have obtained both Stafford and PLUS loans, depending on the types of loans the student borrower has obtained, for attendance at the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;

      (ii) Review for the student borrower available repayment plan options, including standard, graduated, extended, income sensitive and income-based repayment plans, including a description of the different features of each plan and sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and total payments under each plan;

      (iii) Explain to the borrower the options to prepay each loan, to pay each loan on a shorter schedule, and to change repayment plans;

      (iv) Provide information on the effects of loan consolidation including, at a minimum—

      (A) The effects of consolidation on total interest to be paid, fees to be paid, and length of repayment;

      (B) The effects of consolidation on a borrower's underlying loan benefits, including grace periods, loan forgiveness, cancellation, and deferment opportunities;

      (C) The options of the borrower to prepay the loan and to change repayment plans; and

      (D) That borrower benefit programs may vary among different lenders;

      (v) Include debt-management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;

      (vi) Explain to the borrower the use of a Master Promissory Note;

      (vii) Emphasize to the student borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the borrower has assumed;

      (viii) Emphasize to the student borrower that the full amount of the loan (other than a loan made or originated by the school) must be repaid in full even if the student borrower does not complete the program, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services that the student borrower purchased from the school;

      (ix) Describe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures under Federal law, and litigation;

      (x) Provide—

      (A) A general description of the terms and conditions under which a borrower may obtain full or partial forgiveness or discharge of principal and interest, defer repayment of principal or interest, or be granted forbearance on a title IV loan, including forgiveness benefits or discharge benefits available to a FFEL borrower who consolidates his or her loan into the Direct Loan program; and

      (B) A copy, either in print or by electronic means, of the information the Secretary makes available pursuant to section 485(d) of the HEA;

      (xi) Require the student borrower to provide current information concerning name, address, social security number, references, and driver's license number and State of issuance, as well as the student borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the student borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the student borrower's expected employer (if known). The school must ensure that this information is provided to the guaranty agency or agencies listed in the student borrower's records within 60 days after the student borrower provides the information;

      (xii) Review for the student borrower information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office;

      (xiii) Inform the student borrower of the availability of title IV loan information in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and how NSLDS can be used to obtain title IV loan status information; and

      (xiv) A general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers.

      (3) If exit counseling is conducted by electronic interactive means, the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and completes the counseling.

      (4) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.

      (5)(i) For students who have received both FFEL Program and Direct Loan Program loans for attendance at a school, the school's compliance with the exit counseling requirements in 34 CFR 685.304(b) satisfies the requirements of this section if the school ensures that the exit counseling also provides the borrower with the information described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (ii) A student's completion of electronic interactive exit counseling offered by the Secretary satisfies the requirements of this section, and for students who have also received Direct Loan Program loans for attendance at the school, the requirements of 34 CFR 685.304(b).

      (1) Respond to the complaint or information; and

      (2) Show that the violation has been corrected or submit an acceptable plan for correcting the violation and preventing its recurrence.

      (c) The Secretary does not delay limitation, suspension, or termination procedures during the informal compliance procedure if—

      § 682.704   Emergency action.

#### § § 682.704

      (a) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, may take emergency action to withhold payment of interest benefits and special allowance to a lender if the Secretary—

      (2) Determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent the likelihood of substantial losses by the Federal Government, parent borrowers, or students; and

      (3) Determines that the likelihood of loss exceeds the importance of following the procedures for limitation, suspension, or termination.

      (b) The Secretary begins an emergency action by notifying the lender or third-party servicer, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the action and the basis for the action.

      (c) The action becomes effective on the date the notice is mailed to the lender or third-party servicer.

      (d)(1) An emergency action does not exceed 30 days unless a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding is begun before that time expires.

      (ii) Upon the written request of the lender or third-party servicer, the Secretary may provide the lender or servicer with an opportunity to demonstrate that the emergency action is unwarranted.

      § 682.705   Suspension proceedings.

#### § § 682.705

      (a)  (1) A suspension by the Secretary removes a lender's eligibility under the FFEL programs or a third-party servicer's ability to enter into contracts with eligible lenders, and the Secretary does not guarantee or reinsure a new loan serviced by the servicer during a period not to exceed 60 days from the date the suspension becomes effective, unless—

      (i) The lender or servicer and the Secretary agree to an extension of the suspension period, if the lender or third-party servicer has not requested a hearing; or

      (ii) The Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding.

      (2) If the Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding before the suspension period ends, the Secretary may extend the suspension period until the completion of that proceeding, including any appeal to the Secretary.

      (vi) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged violations.

      § 682.706   Limitation or termination proceedings.

#### § § 682.706

      (a)  (1) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, begins a limitation or termination proceeding, whether a suspension proceeding has begun, by sending the lender or third-party servicer a notice by certified mail with return receipt requested.

      (2) The notice—

      (i) Informs the lender or servicer of the Secretary's intent to limit or terminate the lender's or servicer's eligibility;

      (ii) Describes the consequences of a limitation or termination;

      (iii) Identifies the alleged violations on which the proposed limitation or termination is based;

      (iv) States the limits which may be imposed, in the case of a limitation proceeding;

      (v) States the proposed date the limitation or termination becomes effective, which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the notice;

      (vi) Informs the lender or servicer that the limitation or termination will not take effect on the proposed date if the Secretary receives, at least five days prior to that date, a request for an oral hearing or written material showing why the limitation or termination should not take effect;

      (vii) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged violations; and

      (viii) Notifies the lender or servicer that the Secretary may collect any amount owed by means of offset against amounts owed to the lender by the Department and other Federal agencies.

      (b)  (1) If the lender or servicer does not request an oral hearing but submits written material, the Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, considers the material and—

      (i) Dismisses the proposed limitation or termination; or

      (ii) Notifies the lender or servicer of the date the limitation or termination becomes effective.

      (2) If the lender or servicer requests a hearing within the time specified in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section, the Secretary schedules the date and place of the hearing. The date is at least 15 days after receipt of the request from the lender or servicer. No proposed limitation or termination takes effect until a hearing is held.

      (3) The hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who—

      (i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;

      (ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the hearing and other relevant evidence presented during the hearing; and

      (iii) Issues an initial decision, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law, that may limit or terminate the lender's or servicer's eligibility if the presiding officer is persuaded that the limitation or termination is warranted by the evidence.

      (4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix), is required.

      (5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on evidence presented at or before the hearing and matters given official notice.

      (6) If a termination action is brought against a lender or third-party servicer and the presiding officer concludes that a limitation is more appropriate, the presiding officer may issue a decision imposing one or more limitations on a lender or third-party servicer rather than terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility.

      (7) In a termination action against a lender or third-party servicer based on a debarment under Executive Order 12549 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 that does not meet the standards described in 2 CFR 3485.612(d), the presiding official finds that the debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for debarment and termination under this subpart exists.

      (8) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the lender or servicer.

      (9) Any time schedule specified in this section may be shortened with the approval of the presiding officer and the consent of the lender or servicer and the Secretary or designated Departmental official.

      (10) The presiding officer's initial decision automatically becomes the Secretary's final decision 20 days after it is issued and received by both parties unless the lender, servicer, or designated Departmental official appeals the decision to the Secretary within this period.

      (c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if a lender or a lender's owner or officer or third-party servicer or servicer's owner or officer, respectively, is convicted of or pled  or guilty to a crime involving the unlawful acquisition, use, or expenditure of FFEL program funds, that conviction or guilty plea is grounds for terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility, respectively, to participate in the FFEL programs.

      § 682.707   Appeals in a limitation or termination proceeding.

#### § § 682.707

      (a) If the lender, third-party servicer, or designated Departmental official appeals the initial decision of the presiding officer in accordance with § 682.706(b)(10)—

      (1) An appeal is made to the Secretary by submitting to the Secretary and the opposing party within 15 days of the date of the appealing party's receipt of the presiding officer's decision, a brief or other written material explaining why the decision of the presiding officer should be overturned or modified; and

      (2) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other written material to the Secretary and the appealing party within 15 days of its receipt of the brief or written material of the appealing party.

      (b) The Secretary issues a final decision affirming, modifying, or reversing the initial decision, including a statement of the reasons for the Secretary's decision.

      (c) Any party submitting material to the Secretary shall provide a copy to each party that participates in the hearing.

      (d) If the presiding officer's initial decision would limit or terminate the lender's or servicer's eligibility, it does not take effect pending the appeal unless the Secretary determines that a stay of the date it becomes effective would seriously and adversely affect the FFEL programs or student or parent borrowers.

      § 682.709   Reimbursements, refunds, and offsets.

#### § § 682.709

      (a) As part of a limitation or termination proceeding, the Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, may require a lender or third-party servicer to take reasonable corrective action to remedy a violation of applicable laws, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA.

      (b) The corrective action may include payment to the Secretary or recipients designated by the Secretary of any funds, and any interest thereon, that the lender, or, in the case of a third-party servicer, the servicer or the lender that has a contract with a third-party servicer, improperly received, withheld, disbursed, or caused to be disbursed. A third-party servicer may be held liable up to the amounts specified in § 682.413(a)(2).

      (c) If a final decision requires a lender, a lender that has a contract with a third-party servicer, or a third-party servicer to reimburse or make any payment to the Secretary, the Secretary may, without further notice or opportunity for a hearing, proceed to offset or arrange for another Federal agency to offset the amount due against any interest benefits, special allowance, or other payments due to the lender, the lender that has a contract with the third-party servicer, or the third-party servicer. A third-party servicer may be held liable up to the amounts specified in § 682.413(a)(2).

      (d) In any action under this part based on a violation of the prohibitions in section 435(d)(5) of the Act, if the Secretary, the designated Department official, or the hearing official finds that the lender provided or offered the payments or activities described in paragraph (5)(i) of the definition of “lender” in § 682.200(b), the Secretary or the official applies a rebuttable presumption that the payments or activities were offered or provided to secure applications for FFEL loans. To reverse the presumption, the lender must present evidence that the activities or payments were provided for a reason unrelated to securing applications for FFEL loans or securing FFEL loan volume.

      (2) The expiration of the period of debarment under Executive Order 12459 or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.

      (b) The request must be in writing and must show that—

      (1) The lender or servicer has corrected any violations on which the termination was based; and

      § 682.712   Disqualification review of limitation, suspension, and termination actions taken by guarantee agencies against lenders.

#### § § 682.712

      (a) The Secretary reviews a limitation, suspension, or termination action taken by a guaranty agency against a lender participating in the FFEL programs to determine if national disqualification is appropriate. Upon completion of the Secretary's review, the Secretary notifies the guaranty agency and the lender of the Secretary's decision by mail.

      (b) The Secretary disqualifies a lender from participation in the FFEL programs if—

      (1) The lender waives review by the Secretary; or

      (2) The Secretary conducts the review and determines that the limitation, suspension, or termination was imposed in accordance with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act.

      (c)(1) Disqualification by the Secretary continues until the Secretary is satisfied that—

      (i) The lender has corrected the failure that led to the limitation, suspension, or termination; and

      (ii) There are reasonable assurances that the lender will comply with the requirements of the FFEL programs in the future.

      (2) Revocation of disqualification by the Secretary does not remove any limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by the agency whose action resulted in the disqualification.

      (d) A guaranty agency shall refer a limitation, suspension, or termination action that it takes against a lender to the Secretary within 30 days of its final decision to limit, suspend, or terminate the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.

      (e) The Secretary reviews an agency's limitation, suspension, or termination of a lender's eligibility only when the guaranty agency's action is final, e.g, the lender is not entitled to any further appeals within the guaranty agency. A subsequent court challenge to an agency's action does not by itself affect the timing of the Secretary's review.

      (f) The guaranty agency's notice to the Secretary regarding a termination action must include a certified copy of the administrative record compiled by the agency with regard to the action. The record must include certified copies of the following documents:

      (1) The guaranty agency's letter initiating the action.

      (2) The lender's response.

      (3) The transcript of the agency's hearing.

      (4) The decision of the agency's hearing officer.

      (5) The decision of the agency on appeal from the hearing officer's decision, if any.

      (6) The regulations and written procedures of the agency under which the action was taken.

      (7) The audit or lender review report or documented basis that led to the action.

      (8) All other documents relevant to the action.

      (g) The guaranty agency's referral notice to the Secretary regarding a limitation or suspension action must include—

      (1) The documents described in paragraph (f) of this section; and

      (2) Documents describing and substantiating the existence of one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (h)(1) Within 60 days of the Secretary's receipt of a referral notice described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the Secretary makes an initial assessment, based on the agency's record, as to whether the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act.

      (2) In the case of a referral notice described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Secretary also determines whether one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section exist.

      (3) If the Secretary concludes that the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act and, if applicable, one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section exist, the Secretary notifies the lender that the Secretary will review the guaranty agency's action to determine whether to disqualify the lender from further participation in the FFEL programs and affords the lender an opportunity—

      (i) To waive the review and be disqualified immediately; or

      (ii) To request a review.

      (i) In the case of an action by an agency that limits or suspends a lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program, the agency shall provide the Secretary with a referral as described in paragraph (g) of this section only if—

      (1) The lender has not corrected the violation. A violation is corrected if, among other things, the lender has satisfied fully all liabilities incurred by the lender as a result of the violation, including its liability to the Secretary, or the lender has arranged to satisfy those liabilities in a manner acceptable to the parties to whom the liabilities are owed;

      (2) The lender has not provided satisfactory assurances to the agency of future compliance with program requirements; or

      (3) The guaranty agency determines that special circumstances warrant disqualification of the lender from the FFEL programs for a significant period, notwithstanding the agency's decision not to terminate the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.

Graduate and professional students are not eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans for any period of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 2012.

      (ii) The Secretary does not subsidize the interest that accrues during the grace period on any Direct Subsidized Loan for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014.

      (2) Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program (Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program), which provides loans to undergraduate, graduate and professional students.

For purposes of this paragraph, the interest rate includes any other charges or fees applied to the loan. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(11), the term “military service” means—

      (i) In the case of a servicemember who is a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard—

      (A) Active duty, meaning full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Such term includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Such term does not include full-time National Guard duty.

      (B) In the case of a member of the National Guard, including service under a call to active service, which means service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty, authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds;

      (iii) Any period during which a servicemember is absent from duty on account of sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary may add unpaid accrued interest to the borrower's unpaid principal balance. This increase in the principal balance of a loan is called “capitalization.”

      (2) For a Direct Loan not eligible for interest subsidies during periods of deferment, the Secretary capitalizes the unpaid interest that has accrued on the loan upon the expiration of the deferment.

      (c)  The Secretary—

      (1)(i) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed prior to February 8, 2006, charges a borrower a loan fee not to exceed 4 percent of the principal amount of the loan;

      (ii) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed on or after February 8, 2006, but before July 1, 2007, charges a borrower a loan fee not to exceed 3 percent of the principal amount of the loan;

      (iii) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2007, but before July 1, 2008, charges a borrower a loan fee not to exceed 2.5 percent of the principal amount of the loan;

      (iv) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, but before July 1, 2009, charges the borrower a loan fee not to exceed 2 percent of the principal amount of the loan;

      (v) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2009, but before July 1, 2010, charges the borrower a loan fee not to exceed 1.5 percent of the principal amount of the loan;

      (vi) For a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2010, charges the borrower a loan fee not to exceed 1 percent of the principal amount of the loan; and

      (vii) Charges a borrower a loan fee of four percent of the principal amount of the loan on a Direct PLUS loan.

      (2) Deducts the loan fee from the proceeds of the loan;

      (3) In the case of a loan disbursed in multiple installments, deducts a pro rated portion of the fee from each disbursement; and

      (4) Applies to a borrower's loan balance the portion of the loan fee previously deducted from the loan that is attributable to any portion of the loan that is—

      (i) Repaid or returned within 120 days of disbursement, unless—

      (A) The borrower has no Direct Loans in repayment status and has requested, in writing, that the repaid or returned funds be used for a different purpose; or

      (B) The borrower has a Direct Loan in repayment status, in which case the payment is applied in accordance with § 685.211(a) unless the borrower has requested, in writing, that the repaid or returned funds be applied as a cancellation of all or part of the loan; or

      (ii) Returned by a school in order to comply with the Act or with applicable regulations.

      (d)  (1) The Secretary may require the borrower to pay a late charge of up to six cents for each dollar of each installment or portion thereof that is late under the circumstances described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (2) The late charge may be assessed if the borrower fails to pay all or a portion of a required installment payment within 30 days after it is due.

      (e)(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of State law, the Secretary may require that the borrower or any endorser pay costs incurred by the Secretary or the Secretary's agents in collecting installments not paid when due. These charges do not include routine collection costs associated with preparing letters or notices or with making personal contacts with the borrower ( local and long-distance telephone calls).

      (2)  If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the Secretary assesses collection costs on the basis of 34 CFR 30.60.

      (2) A Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan, Direct PLUS Loan, or Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan borrower who meets the requirements described in paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section is eligible for a deferment during which periodic installments of principal need not be paid but interest does accrue and is capitalized or paid by the borrower. At or before the time a deferment is granted, the Secretary provides information, including an example, to assist the borrower in understanding the impact of capitalization of accrued, unpaid interest on the borrower's loan principal and on the total amount of interest to be paid over the life of the loan.

      (3) A borrower whose loan is in default is not eligible for a deferment, unless the borrower has made payment arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary.

      (4)(i) To receive a deferment, except as provided for in-school deferments under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section, the borrower must request the deferment and, except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, provide the Secretary with all information and documents required to establish eligibility for the deferment.

      (ii) In the case of a military service deferment under paragraph (h) of this section, a borrower's representative may request the deferment and provide the required information and documents on behalf of the borrower. If the Secretary grants a military service deferment based on a request from a borrower's representative, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the deferment has been granted and that the borrower has the option to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan. The Secretary may also notify the borrower's representative of the outcome of the deferment request.

      (5)(i) After receiving a borrower's written or verbal request for a deferment, the Secretary may grant a graduate fellowship deferment under paragraph (d), a rehabilitation training deferment under paragraph (e), an unemployment deferment under paragraph (f), an economic hardship deferment under paragraph (g), a military service deferment under paragraph (h), or a post-active duty student deferment under paragraph (i) of this section if the Secretary confirms that the borrower has received a deferment on a FFEL Program loan for the same reason and during the same time period.

      (ii) The Secretary will grant a deferment based on the information obtained under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section when determining a borrower's eligibility for a deferment, unless the Secretary, as of the date of the determination, has information indicating that the borrower does not qualify for the deferment. The Secretary will resolve any discrepant information before granting a deferment under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.

      (iii) If the Secretary grants a deferment under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the deferment has been granted and that the borrower has the option to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan.

      (b)  (1) A Direct Loan borrower is eligible for a deferment during any period during which—

      (i) The borrower is carrying at least one-half the normal full-time work load for the course of study that the borrower is pursuing, as determined by the eligible school the borrower is attending; and

      (ii) The borrower is not serving in a medical internship or residency program, except for a residency program in dentistry.

      (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Secretary processes a deferment when—

      (i) The borrower submits a request to the Secretary along with documentation verifying the borrower's eligibility;

      (ii) The Secretary receives information from the borrower's school indicating that the borrower is eligible to receive a new loan;

      (iii) The Secretary receives student status information from the borrower's school, either directly or indirectly, indicating that the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis; or

The Secretary considers a substantial commitment by the borrower to be a commitment of time and effort that normally would prevent an individual from engaging in full-time employment, either because of the number of hours that must be devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the rehabilitation. For the purpose of this paragraph, full-time employment involves at least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at least three months.

      (i) A borrower may qualify for an unemployment deferment whether or not the borrower has been previously employed.

      (ii) An unemployment deferment is not justified if the borrower refuses to seek or accept employment in kinds of positions or at salary and responsibility levels for which the borrower feels overqualified by virtue of education or previous experience.

      (iii) Full-time employment involves at least 30 hours of work a week and is expected to last at least three months.

      (4) The Secretary does not grant an unemployment deferment beyond the date that is six months after the date the borrower provides evidence of the borrower's eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section or the date the borrower provides the written certification, or an approved equivalent, under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (g)  (1)(i) A Direct Loan borrower is eligible for a deferment during periods that, collectively, do not exceed three years in which the borrower has experienced or will experience an economic hardship in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

      (iii) Is working full-time (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section) and has a monthly income (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section) that does not exceed the greater of (as calculated on a monthly basis)—

      (A) The minimum wage rate described in section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; or

      (B) An amount equal to 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(v) of this section) as published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).

      (v) Family size means the number that is determined by counting the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the period covered by the deferment, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower requests the economic hardship deferment, the other individuals—

      (A) Live with the borrower; and

      (B) Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size. Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car, medical and dental care, and payment of college costs.

      (B) Any accompanying request for reimbursement of payments previously made to the Secretary on the Direct Loan or on a loan repaid by the Direct Consolidation Loan.

      (iv) The term “provision of educational services” under this paragraph (e) refers to the educational resources provided by the institution that are required by an accreditation agency or a State licensing or authorizing agency for the completion of the student's educational program.

      (v) The terms “school” and “institution” under this paragraph (e) may be used interchangeably and include an eligible institution, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services.

      (2)  For a Direct Loan or Direct Consolidation Loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, and before July 1, 2023, a borrower may assert a defense to repayment under this paragraph (e), if the borrower establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that—

      (i) The institution at which the borrower enrolled made a misrepresentation, as defined in § 685.206(e)(3), of material fact upon which the borrower reasonably relied in deciding to obtain a Direct Loan, or a loan repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan, and that directly and clearly relates to:

      (A) Enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or

      (B) The provision of educational services for which the loan was made; and

      (ii) The borrower was financially harmed by the misrepresentation.

      (3)  A “misrepresentation,” for purposes of this paragraph (e), is a statement, act, or omission by an eligible school to a borrower that is false, misleading, or deceptive; that was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth; and that directly and clearly relates to enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or the provision of educational services for which the loan was made. Evidence that a misrepresentation defined in this paragraph (e) may have occurred includes, but is not limited to:

      (i) Actual licensure passage rates materially different from those included in the institution's marketing materials, website, or other communications made to the student;

      (ii) Actual employment rates materially different from those included in the institution's marketing materials, website, or other communications made to the student;

      (iii) Actual institutional selectivity rates or rankings, student admission profiles, or institutional rankings that are materially different from those included in the institution's marketing materials, website, or other communications made to the student or provided by the institution to national ranking organizations;

      (iv) The inclusion in the institution's marketing materials, website, or other communication made to the student of specialized, programmatic, or institutional certifications, accreditation, or approvals not actually obtained, or the failure to remove within a reasonable period of time such certifications or approvals from marketing materials, website, or other communication when revoked or withdrawn;

      (v) The inclusion in the institution's marketing materials, website, or other communication made to the student of representations regarding the widespread or general transferability of credits that are only transferrable to limited types of programs or institutions or the transferability of credits to a specific program or institution when no reciprocal agreement exists with another institution, or such agreement is materially different than what was represented;

      (vi) A representation regarding the employability or specific earnings of graduates without an agreement between the institution and another entity for such employment data, or sufficient evidence of past employment or earnings to justify such a representation, or without citing appropriate national, State, or regional data for earnings in the same field as provided by an appropriate Federal agency that provides such data. (In the event that national data are used, institutions should include a written, plain language disclaimer that national averages may not accurately reflect the earnings of workers in particular parts of the country and may include earners at all stages of their career and not just entry level wages for recent graduates.);

      (vii) A representation regarding the availability, amount, or nature of any financial assistance available to students from the institution or any other entity to pay the costs of attendance at the institution that is materially different in availability, amount, or nature from the actual financial assistance available to the borrower from the institution or any other entity to pay the costs of attendance at the institution after enrollment;

      (viii) A representation regarding the amount, method, or timing of payment of tuition and fees that the student would be charged for the program that is materially different in amount, method, or timing of payment from the actual tuition and fees charged to the student;

      (ix) A representation that the institution, its courses, or programs are endorsed by vocational counselors, high schools, colleges, educational organizations, employment agencies, members of a particular industry, students, former students, governmental officials, Federal or State agencies, the United States Armed Forces, or other individuals or entities when the institution has no permission or is not otherwise authorized to make or use such an endorsement;

      (x) A representation regarding the educational resources provided by the institution that are required for the completion of the student's educational program that are materially different from the institution's actual circumstances at the time the representation is made, such as representations regarding the institution's size; location; facilities; training equipment; or the number, availability, or qualifications of its personnel; and

      (xi) A representation regarding the nature or extent of prerequisites for enrollment in a course or program offered by the institution that are materially different from the institution's actual circumstances at the time the representation is made, or that the institution knows will be materially different during the student's anticipated enrollment at the institution.

      (4)  Under this paragraph (e), financial harm is the amount of monetary loss that a borrower incurs as a consequence of a misrepresentation, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Financial harm does not include damages for nonmonetary loss, such as personal injury, inconvenience, aggravation, emotional distress, pain and suffering, punitive damages, or opportunity costs. The Department does not consider the act of taking out a Direct Loan or a loan repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan, alone, as evidence of financial harm to the borrower. Financial harm is such monetary loss that is not predominantly due to intervening local, regional, or national economic or labor market conditions as demonstrated by evidence before the Secretary or provided to the Secretary by the borrower or the school. Financial harm cannot arise from the borrower's voluntary decision to pursue less than full-time work or not to work or result from a voluntary change in occupation. Evidence of financial harm may include, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:

      (i) Periods of unemployment upon graduating from the school's programs that are unrelated to national or local economic recessions;

      (ii) A significant difference between the amount or nature of the tuition and fees that the institution represented to the borrower that the institution would charge or was charging, and the actual amount or nature of the tuition and fees charged by the institution for which the Direct Loan was disbursed or for which a loan repaid by the Direct Consolidation Loan was disbursed;

      (iii) The borrower's inability to secure employment in the field of study for which the institution expressly guaranteed employment; and

      (iv) The borrower's inability to complete the program because the institution no longer offers a requirement necessary for completion of the program in which the borrower enrolled and the institution did not provide for an acceptable alternative requirement to enable completion of the program.

      (5)  The Secretary will not accept the following as a basis for a borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e)—

      (i) A violation by the institution of a requirement of the Act or the Department's regulations for a borrower defense to repayment under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or under § 685.222, unless the violation would otherwise constitute the basis for a successful borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e); or

      (ii) A claim that does not directly and clearly relate to enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or the provision of educational services for which the loan was made, including, but not limited to—

      (A) Personal injury;

      (B) Sexual harassment;

      (C) A violation of civil rights;

      (D) Slander or defamation;

      (E) Property damage;

      (F) The general quality of the student's education or the reasonableness of an educator's conduct in providing educational services;

      (G) Informal communication from other students;

      (H) Academic disputes and disciplinary matters; and

      (I) Breach of contract unless the school's act or omission would otherwise constitute the basis for a successful defense to repayment under this paragraph (e).

      (6)  A borrower must assert a defense to repayment under this paragraph (e) within 3 years from the date the student is no longer enrolled at the institution. A borrower may only assert a defense to repayment under this paragraph (e) within the timeframes set forth in this paragraph (e)(6) and paragraph (e)(7) of this section.

      (7)  For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, and before July 1, 2023, the Secretary may extend the time period when a borrower may assert a defense to repayment under § 685.206(e)(6) or may reopen a borrower's defense to repayment application to consider evidence that was not previously considered only if there is:

      (i) A final, non-default judgment on the merits by a State or Federal Court that has not been appealed or that is not subject to further appeal and that establishes the institution made a misrepresentation, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; or

      (ii) A final decision by a duly appointed arbitrator or arbitration panel that establishes that the institution made a misrepresentation, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (8)  To assert a defense to repayment under this paragraph (e), a borrower must submit an application under penalty of perjury on a form approved by the Secretary and sign a waiver permitting the institution to provide the Department with items from the borrower's education record relevant to the defense to repayment claim. The form will note that pursuant to § 685.205(b)(6)(i), if the borrower is not in default on the loan for which a borrower defense has been asserted, the Secretary will grant forbearance and notify the borrower of the option to decline forbearance. The application requires the borrower to—

      (i) Certify that the borrower received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, to attend the named institution;

      (ii) Provide evidence that supports the borrower defense to repayment application;

      (iii) State whether the borrower has made a claim with any other third party, such as the holder of a performance bond, a public fund, or a tuition recovery program, based on the same act or omission of the institution on which the borrower defense to repayment is based;

      (iv) State the amount of any payment received by the borrower or credited to the borrower's loan obligation through the third party, in connection with a borrower defense to repayment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;

      (v) State the financial harm, as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, that the borrower alleges to have been caused and provide any information relevant to assessing whether the borrower incurred financial harm, including providing documentation that the borrower actively pursued employment in the field for which the borrower's education prepared the borrower if the borrower is a recent graduate (failure to provide such information results in a presumption that the borrower failed to actively pursue employment in the field); whether the borrower was terminated or removed for performance reasons from a position in the field for which the borrower's education prepared the borrower, or in a related field; and whether the borrower failed to meet other requirements of or qualifications for employment in such field for reasons unrelated to the school's misrepresentation underlying the borrower defense to repayment, such as the borrower's ability to pass a drug test, satisfy driving record requirements, and meet any health qualifications; and

      (vi) State that the borrower understands that in the event that the borrower receives a 100 percent discharge of the balance of the loan for which the defense to repayment application has been submitted, the institution may, if allowed or not prohibited by other applicable law, refuse to verify or to provide an official transcript that verifies the borrower's completion of credits or a credential associated with the discharged loan.

      (9)  (i) If the borrower asserts both a borrower defense to repayment and any other objection to an action of the Secretary with regard to a Direct Loan or a loan repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan under this paragraph (e), the order in which the Secretary will consider objections, including a borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e), will be determined as appropriate under the circumstances.

      (ii) With respect to the borrower defense to repayment application submitted under this paragraph (e), the Secretary may consider evidence otherwise in the possession of the Secretary, including from the Department's internal records or other relevant evidence obtained by the Secretary, as practicable, provided that the Secretary permits the institution and the borrower to review and respond to this evidence and to submit additional evidence.

      (10)  (i) Upon receipt of a borrower defense to repayment application under this paragraph (e), the Department will notify the school of the pending application and provide a copy of the borrower's request and any supporting documents, a copy of any evidence otherwise in the possession of the Secretary, and a waiver signed by the student permitting the institution to provide the Department with items from the student's education record relevant to the defense to repayment claim to the school, and invite the school to respond and to submit evidence, within the specified timeframe included in the notice, which will be no less than 60 days.

      (ii) Upon receipt of the school's response, the Department will provide the borrower a copy of the school's submission as well as any evidence otherwise in possession of the Secretary, which was provided to the school, and will give the borrower an opportunity to submit a reply within a specified timeframe, which will be no less than 60 days. The borrower's reply must be limited to issues and evidence raised in the school's submission and any evidence otherwise in the possession of the Secretary.

      (iii) The Department will provide the school a copy of the borrower's reply.

      (iv) There will be no other submissions by the borrower or the school to the Secretary unless the Secretary requests further clarifying information.

      (11)  (i) After considering the borrower's application and all applicable evidence under this paragraph (e), the Secretary issues a written decision—

      (A) Notifying the borrower and the school of the decision on the borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e);

      (B) Providing the reasons for the decision; and

      (C) Informing the borrower and the school of the relief, if any, that the borrower will receive, consistent with paragraph (e)(12) of this section and specifying the relief determination.

      (ii) If the Department receives a borrower defense to repayment application that is incomplete and is within the limitations period in paragraph (e)(6) or (7) of this section, the Department will not issue a written decision on the application and instead will notify the borrower in writing that the application is incomplete and will return the application to the borrower.

      (12)  (i) If the Secretary grants the borrower's request for relief based on a borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e), the Secretary notifies the borrower and the school that the borrower is relieved of the obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay or will be reimbursed for amounts paid toward the loan voluntarily or through enforced collection. The amount of relief that a borrower receives under this paragraph (e) may exceed the amount of financial harm, as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, that the borrower alleges in the application pursuant to paragraph (e)(8)(v) of this section. The Secretary determines the amount of relief and awards relief limited to the monetary loss that a borrower incurred as a consequence of a misrepresentation, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The amount of relief cannot exceed the amount of the loan and any associated costs and fees and will be reduced by the amount of refund, reimbursement, indemnification, restitution, compensatory damages, settlement, debt forgiveness, discharge, cancellation, compromise, or any other financial benefit received by, or on behalf of, the borrower that was related to the borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e). In awarding relief under this paragraph (e), the Secretary considers the borrower's application, as described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, which includes information about any payments received by the borrower and the financial harm alleged by the borrower. In awarding relief under this paragraph (e), the Secretary also considers the school's response, the borrower's reply, and any evidence otherwise in the possession of the Secretary, which was previously provided to the borrower and the school, as described in paragraph (e)(10) of this section. The Secretary also updates reports to consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's Direct Loan or loans repaid by the borrower's Direct Consolidation Loan under this paragraph (e).

      (ii) The Secretary affords the borrower such further relief as the Secretary determines is appropriate under the circumstances. Further relief may include determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.

      (13)  The determination of a borrower's defense to repayment by the Department included in the written decision referenced in paragraph (e)(11) of this section is the final decision of the Department and is not subject to appeal within the Department.

      (14)  The Secretary may revoke any relief granted to a borrower under this section who refuses to cooperate with the Secretary in any proceeding under this paragraph (e) or under part 668, subpart G. Such cooperation includes, but is not limited to—

      (i) Providing testimony regarding any representation made by the borrower to support a successful borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e); and

      (ii) Producing, within timeframes established by the Secretary, any documentation reasonably available to the borrower with respect to those representations and any sworn statement required by the Secretary with respect to those representations and documents.

      (15)  (i) Upon the grant of any relief under this paragraph (e), the borrower is deemed to have assigned to, and relinquished in favor of, the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates and their successors, or its sureties, and any private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party. If the borrower asserts a claim to, and recovers from, a public fund, the Secretary may reinstate the borrower's obligation to repay on the loan an amount based on the amount recovered from the public fund, if the Secretary determines that the borrower's recovery from the public fund was based on the same borrower defense to repayment and for the same loan for which the discharge was granted under this section.

      (ii) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(15) apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those rights by the borrower, limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.

      (iii) Nothing in this paragraph (e)(15) limits or forecloses the borrower's right to pursue legal and equitable relief arising under applicable law against a party described in this paragraph (e)(15) for recovery of any portion of a claim exceeding that assigned to the Secretary or any other claims arising from matters unrelated to the claim on which the loan is discharged.

      (16)  (i) The Secretary may initiate an appropriate proceeding to require the school whose misrepresentation resulted in the borrower's successful borrower defense to repayment under this paragraph (e) to pay to the Secretary the amount of the loan to which the defense applies in accordance with part 668, subpart G. This paragraph (e)(16) would also be applicable for provisionally certified institutions.

      (ii) Under this paragraph (e), the Secretary will not initiate such a proceeding more than 5 years after the date of the final determination included in the written decision referenced in paragraph (e)(11) of this section. The Department will notify the school of the borrower defense to repayment application within 60 days of the date of the Department's receipt of the borrower's application.

      (C) The borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower and are not included in the family size for any other borrower except the borrower's spouse who filed jointly with the borrower; and

      (D) Other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals live with the borrower and receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year for which the borrower certifies family size.

      (A) Dividing the outstanding principal and interest balance of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans by the borrower's total outstanding principal and interest balance on eligible loans; and

      (B) Multiplying the borrower's payment amount as calculated in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section or the borrower's adjusted payment amount as determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section by the percentage determined under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.

      (8) Once the borrower has 3 monthly payments remaining under the 12-month period specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the Secretary follows the procedures in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(7) of this section.

      (9) If the Secretary requires information from the borrower under paragraph (l)(3) of this section to recalculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount under paragraph (l)(8) of this section, and the borrower does not provide the necessary documentation to the Secretary by the time the last payment is due under the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section—

      (i) For the IBR and PAYE plans, the borrower's monthly payment amount is the amount determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section;

      (ii) For the ICR plan, the borrower's monthly payment amount is the amount the borrower would have paid under a 10-year standard repayment plan based on the total balance of the loans being repaid under the ICR Plan when the borrower initially entered the ICR Plan; and

      (iii) For the REPAYE plan, the Secretary removes the borrower from the REPAYE plan and places the borrower on an alternative repayment plan under which the borrower's required monthly payment is the amount the borrower would have paid on a 10-year standard repayment plan based on the current loan balances and interest rates on the loans at the time the borrower is removed from the REPAYE plan.

      (10) At any point during the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's payment earlier than would have otherwise been the case to account for a change in the borrower's circumstances, such as a loss of income or employment or divorce. In such cases, the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section is reset based on the borrower's new information.

      (11) The Secretary tracks a borrower's progress toward eligibility for forgiveness under paragraph (k) of this section and forgives loans that meet the criteria under paragraph (k) of this section without the need for an application or documentation from the borrower.

      (m)  The Secretary places a borrower on the IDR plan under this section that results in the lowest monthly payment based on the borrower's income and family size if—

      (1) The borrower is otherwise eligible for the plan;

      (2) The borrower has approved the disclosure of tax information under paragraph (l)(1) of this section;

      (3) The borrower has not made a scheduled payment on the loan for at least 75 days or is in default on the loan and is not subject to a Federal offset, administrative wage garnishment under section 488A of the Act, or to a judgment secured through litigation; and

      (4) The Secretary determines that the borrower's payment under the IDR plan would be lower than or equal to the payment on the plan in which the borrower is enrolled.

      (n)  The Secretary will no longer consider a borrower in default on a loan if—

      (1) The borrower provides information necessary to calculate a payment under paragraph (f) of this section;

      (2) The payment calculated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is $0; and

      (3) The income information used to calculate the payment under paragraph (f) of this section includes the point at which the loan defaulted.

      § 685.210   Choice of repayment plan.

#### § § 685.210

      (a)  (1) Before a Direct Loan enters into repayment, the Secretary provides a borrower with a description of the available repayment plans and requests that the borrower select one. A borrower may select a repayment plan before the loan enters repayment by notifying the Secretary of the borrower's selection in writing.

      (2) If a borrower does not select a repayment plan, the Secretary designates the standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b) or (c) for the borrower, as applicable.

      (3) All Direct Loans obtained by one borrower must be repaid together under the same repayment plan, except that—

      (i) A borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan or a Direct Consolidation Loan that is not eligible for repayment under an IDR plan may repay the Direct PLUS Loan or Direct Consolidation Loan separately from other Direct Loans obtained by the borrower; and

      (ii) A borrower of a Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan that entered repayment before July 1, 2006, may repay the Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan separately from other Direct Loans obtained by that borrower.

      (b)  (1) A borrower who has entered repayment may change to any other repayment plan for which the borrower is eligible at any time by notifying the Secretary. However, a borrower who is repaying a defaulted loan under the IBR plan or who is repaying a Direct Consolidation Loan under an IDR plan in accordance with § 685.220(d)(1)(i)(A)() may not change to another repayment plan unless—

      (i) The borrower was required to and did make a payment under the IBR plan or other IDR plan in each of the prior three months; or

      (ii) The borrower was not required to make payments but made three reasonable and affordable payments in each of the prior 3 months; and

      (iii) The borrower makes, and the Secretary approves, a request to change plans.

      (2)(i) A borrower may not change to a repayment plan that would cause the borrower to have a remaining repayment period that is less than zero months, except that an eligible borrower may change to an IDR plan under § 685.209 at any time.

      (ii) For the purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the remaining repayment period is—

      (A) For a fixed repayment plan under § 685.208 or an alternative repayment plan under § 685.221, the maximum repayment period for the repayment plan the borrower is seeking to enter, less the period of time since the loan has entered repayment, plus any periods of deferment and forbearance; and

      (B) For an IDR plan under § 685.209, as determined under § 685.209(k).

      (3) A borrower who made payments under the IBR plan and successfully completed rehabilitation of a defaulted loan may chose the REPAYE plan when the loan is returned to current repayment if the borrower is otherwise eligible for the REPAYE plan and if the monthly payment under the REPAYE plan is equal to or less than their payment on IBR.

      (4)(i) If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the IBR plan, the borrower must pay under the standard repayment plan and the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on—

      (A) For a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan, the time remaining under the maximum ten-year repayment period for the amount of the borrower's loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the IBR plan; or

      (B) For a Direct Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under § 685.208(j) and the amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the IBR plan.

      (ii) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the IBR plan and who is required to repay under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with § 685.205(a).

      § 685.211   Miscellaneous repayment provisions.

#### § § 685.211

      (a)  (1)(i) Except as provided for the Income-Based Repayment plan in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary applies any payment in the following order:

      (A) Accrued charges and collection costs.

      (B) Outstanding interest.

      (C) Outstanding principal.

      (ii) The Secretary applies any payment made under the Income-Based Repayment plan in the following order:

      (A) Accrued interest.

      (B) Collection costs.

      (C) Late charges.

      (D) Loan principal.

      (2) A borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without penalty. If a borrower pays any amount in excess of the amount due, the excess amount is a prepayment.

      (3) If a prepayment equals or exceeds the monthly repayment amount under the borrower's repayment plan, the Secretary—

      (i) Applies the prepaid amount according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

      (ii) Advances the due date of the next payment unless the borrower requests otherwise; and

      (iii) Notifies the borrower of any revised due date for the next payment.

      (4) If a prepayment is less than the monthly repayment amount, the Secretary applies the prepayment according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (b)  To encourage on-time repayment, the Secretary may reduce the interest rate for a borrower who repays a loan under a system or on a schedule that meets requirements specified by the Secretary.

      (c)  The Secretary applies any refund or return of title IV, HEA program funds that the Secretary receives from a school under § 668.22 against the borrower's outstanding principal and notifies the borrower of the refund or return.

      (d) —(1)  If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the entire unpaid balance and accrued interest are immediately due and payable.

      (2)  If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the Secretary assesses collection charges in accordance with § 685.202(e).

      (3)  (i) The Secretary may take any action authorized by law to collect a defaulted Direct Loan including, but not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the borrower, reporting the default to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, requesting the Internal Revenue Service to offset the borrower's Federal income tax refund, and garnishing the borrower's wages.

      (ii) If a borrower defaults on a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Consolidation Loan, or a student Direct PLUS Loan, the Secretary may designate the income-contingent repayment plan or the income-based repayment plan for the borrower.

      (e)  (1) The Secretary determines that a borrower is ineligible if, at the time the loan was made and without the school's or the Secretary's knowledge, the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) provided false or erroneous information, has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program funds, or took actions that caused the borrower or student—

      (i) To receive a loan for which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible;

      (ii) To receive interest benefits for which the borrower was ineligible; or

      (iii) To receive loan proceeds for a period of enrollment for which the borrower was not eligible.

      (2) If the Secretary makes the determination described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Secretary sends an ineligible borrower a demand letter that requires the borrower to repay some or all of a loan, as appropriate. The demand letter requires that within 30 days from the date the letter is mailed, the borrower repay any principal amount for which the borrower is ineligible and any accrued interest, including interest subsidized by the Secretary, through the previous quarter.

      (3) If a borrower fails to comply with the demand letter described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the borrower is in default on the entire loan.

      (4) A borrower may not consolidate a loan under § 685.220 for which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible.

      (f)  (1) A defaulted Direct Loan, except for a loan on which a judgment has been obtained, is rehabilitated if the borrower makes 9 voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments within 20 days of the due date during 10 consecutive months. The Secretary determines the amount of a borrower's reasonable and affordable payment on the basis of a borrower's total financial circumstances.

      (i) The Secretary initially considers the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount to be an amount equal to the minimum payment required under the IBR plan, except that if this amount is less than $5, the borrower's monthly payment is $5.

      (ii) The Secretary may calculate the payment amount based on information provided orally by the borrower or the borrower's representative and provide the borrower with a rehabilitation agreement using that amount. The Secretary requires the borrower to provide documentation to confirm the borrower's AGI and family size. If the borrower does not provide the Secretary with any documentation requested by the Secretary to calculate or confirm the reasonable and affordable payment amount within a reasonable time deadline set by the Secretary, the rehabilitation agreement provided is null and void.

      (iii) A reasonable and affordable payment amount is not—

      (A) A required minimum loan payment amount ( $50) if the Secretary determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable;

      (B) A percentage of the borrower's total loan balance; or

      (C) Based on other criteria unrelated to the borrower's total financial circumstances.

      (iv) Within 15 business days of the Secretary's determination of the borrower's loan rehabilitation payment amount, the Secretary provides the borrower with a written rehabilitation agreement which includes the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, a prominent statement that the borrower may object orally or in writing to the reasonable and affordable payment amount with the method and timeframe for raising such an objection, a statement that the rehabilitation is null and void if the borrower does not provide the documentation required to calculate the reasonable and affordable payment amount, and an explanation of any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the Secretary. The Secretary does not impose any other conditions unrelated to the amount or timing of the rehabilitation payments in the rehabilitation agreement. The written rehabilitation agreement informs the borrower of the effects of having the loans rehabilitated ( removal of the record of default from the borrower's credit history and return to normal repayment).

      (2) The Secretary provides the borrower with a written statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, as determined by the Secretary, and explaining any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made before the borrower's account can be rehabilitated. The statement informs the borrower that the borrower may object to the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation agreement, and explains the method and timeframe for objecting to the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation agreement.

      (3) If the borrower objects to the monthly payment amount determined under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary recalculates the payment based solely on information provided on a form approved by the Secretary and, if requested, supporting documentation from the borrower and other sources, and considers—

      (i) The borrower's, and if applicable, the spouse's current disposable income, including public assistance payments, and other income received by the borrower and the spouse, such as welfare benefits, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, and workers' compensation. Spousal income is not considered if the spouse does not contribute to the borrower's household income;

      (ii) Family size as defined in § 685.209; and

      (iii) Reasonable and necessary expenses, which include—

      (A) Food;

      (B) Housing;

      (C) Utilities;

      (D) Basic communication expenses;

      (E) Necessary medical and dental costs;

      (F) Necessary insurance costs;

      (G) Transportation costs;

      (H) Dependent care and other work-related expenses;

      (I) Legally required child and spousal support;

      (J) Other title IV and non-title IV student loan payments; and

      (K) Other expenses approved by the Secretary.

      (4) The Secretary provides the borrower with a new written rehabilitation agreement confirming the borrower's recalculated reasonable and affordable payment amount. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the Secretary.

      (5) The Secretary includes any payment made under paragraph (1) of the definition of “satisfactory repayment arrangement” in § 685.102(b) in determining whether the 9 out of 10 payments required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section have been made.

      (6) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

      (7) During the rehabilitation period, the Secretary limits contact with the borrower on the loan being rehabilitated to collection activities that are required by law or regulation and to communications that support the rehabilitation.

      (8) If a defaulted loan is rehabilitated, the Secretary instructs any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported to remove the default from the borrower's credit history.

      (9) A defaulted Direct Loan on which a judgment has been obtained may not be rehabilitated.

      (10) A Direct Loan obtained by fraud for which the borrower has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance may not be rehabilitated.

      (11)(i) If a borrower's loan is being collected by administrative wage garnishment while the borrower is also making monthly payments on the same loan under a loan rehabilitation agreement, the Secretary continues collecting the loan by administrative wage garnishment until the borrower makes five qualifying monthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, unless the Secretary is otherwise precluded from doing so.

      (ii) After the borrower makes the fifth qualifying monthly payment, the Secretary, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, suspends the garnishment order issued to the borrower's employer.

      (iii) A borrower may only obtain the benefit of a suspension of administrative wage garnishment while also attempting to rehabilitate a defaulted loan once.

      (12) Effective for any defaulted Direct Loan that is rehabilitated on or after August 14, 2008, the borrower cannot rehabilitate the loan again if the loan returns to default status following the rehabilitation.

      (13) A borrower who has a Direct Loan that is rehabilitated and which has been returned to repayment status on or after July 1, 2024, may be transferred to REPAYE by the Secretary if the borrower's minimum payment amount on REPAYE would be equal to or less than the minimum payment amount on the Income-Based Repayment Plan.

      § 685.213   Total and permanent disability discharge.

#### § § 685.213

The notification to the borrower includes—

      (A) The reason or reasons for the denial;

      (C) The date that the borrower must resume making payments;

      (D) An explanation that the borrower is not required to submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application if the borrower requests that the Secretary re-evaluate the borrower's application for discharge by providing, within 12 months of the date of the notification, additional information that supports the borrower's eligibility for discharge; and

      (E) An explanation that if the borrower does not request re-evaluation of the borrower's prior discharge application within 12 months of the date of the notification, the borrower must submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary if the borrower wishes the Secretary to re-evaluate the borrower's eligibility for a total and permanent disability discharge.

      (5)  If a borrower received a title IV loan or TEACH Grant before the date the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certified the borrower's discharge application or before the date the Secretary received the SSA data described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section and a disbursement of that loan or grant is made during the period from the date of the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certification or the receipt of the SSA data described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section until the date the Secretary grants a discharge under this section, the processing of the borrower's loan discharge request will be suspended until the borrower ensures that the full amount of the disbursement has been returned to the loan holder or to the Secretary, as applicable.

      (6)  If a borrower receives a disbursement of a new title IV loan or receives a new TEACH Grant made on or after the date the physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist certified the borrower's discharge application or on or after the date the Secretary received the SSA data described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section and before the date the Secretary grants a discharge under this section, the Secretary denies the borrower's discharge request and resumes collection on the borrower's loan.

      (7)  (i) The Secretary reinstates a borrower's obligation to repay a loan that was discharged in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section if, within 3 years after the date the Secretary granted the discharge, the borrower receives a new TEACH Grant or a new loan under the Direct Loan Program, except for a Direct Consolidation Loan that includes loans that were not discharged.

      (A) The reason or reasons for the reinstatement;

      (B) An explanation that the first payment due date on the loan following reinstatement will be no earlier than 90 days after the date of the notification of reinstatement; and

The application must be accompanied by documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs showing that the Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that the veteran is unemployable due to a service-connected disability. The Secretary does not require the veteran to provide any additional documentation related to the veteran's disability. Upon receipt of the veteran's application, the Secretary—

      (i) Identifies all title IV loans owed by the veteran and notifies the lenders that the Secretary has received a total and permanent disability discharge application from the borrower;

      (ii) If the application is incomplete, requests the missing information from the veteran and does not make a determination of eligibility for discharge until the application is complete;

      (iii) Notifies the veteran that no payments are due on the loan while the Secretary determines the veteran's eligibility for discharge; and

      (iv) Explains the Secretary's process for reviewing total and permanent disability discharge applications.

      (ii) If the Secretary determines, based on a review of the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs, that the veteran is not totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the Secretary notifies the veteran that the application for a disability discharge has been denied. The notification to the veteran includes—

      (A) The reason or reasons for the denial;

      (B) An explanation that the loan is due and payable to the Secretary under the terms of the promissory note and that the loan will return to the status it was in at the time the veteran applied for a total and permanent disability discharge;

      (C) The date that the veteran must resume making payments;

      (D) An explanation that the veteran is not required to submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application if the veteran requests that the Secretary re-evaluate the veteran's application for discharge by providing, within 12 months of the date of the notification, additional documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs that supports the veteran's eligibility for discharge; and

      (E) Information on how the veteran may reapply for a total and permanent disability discharge in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section if the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs does not indicate that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), but indicates that the veteran may be totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term.

      (d)  (1) The Secretary will discharge a loan under this section without an application or any additional documentation from the borrower if the Secretary:

      (2) Unless the borrower notifies the Secretary that the borrower does not wish to receive the discharge the Secretary discharges the loan:

      (i) In accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section for a discharge based on data from the SSA; or

      (ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for a discharge based on data from VA.

      § 685.214   Closed school discharge.

#### § § 685.214

      (a)  (1) The Secretary discharges the borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled closed, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2) For purposes of this section—

      (i) If a school has closed, the school's closure date is the earlier of: the date, determined by the Secretary, that the school ceased to provide educational instruction in programs in which most students at the school were enrolled, or a date determined by the Secretary that reflects when the school ceased to provide educational instruction for all of its students;

      (ii) “School” means a school's main campus or any location or branch of the main campus, regardless of whether the school or its location or branch is considered title IV eligible;

      (iii) “Program” means the credential defined by the level and Classification of Instructional Program code in which a student is enrolled, except that the Secretary may define a borrower's program as multiple levels or Classification of Instructional Program codes if:

      (A) The enrollment occurred at the same institution in closely proximate periods;

      (B) The school granted a credential in a program while the student was enrolled in a different program; or

      (C) The programs must be taken in a set order or were presented as necessary for borrowers to complete in order to succeed in the relevant field of employment;

      (b)  (1) Discharge under this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges or collection costs with respect to the loan.

      (2) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the loan.

      (3) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.

      (4) The Secretary reports the discharge of a loan under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.

      (c)  (1) If the Secretary determines based on information in the Secretary's possession that the borrower qualifies for the discharge of a loan under this section, the Secretary discharges the loan without an application or any statement from the borrower 1 year after the institution's closure date if the borrower did not complete the program at another branch or location of the school or through a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency.

      (2) If a borrower accepts but does not complete a continuation of the program at another branch or location of the school or a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency, then the Secretary discharges the loan 1 year after the borrower's last date of attendance at the other branch or location or in the teach-out program.

      (d)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section, to qualify for discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit to the Secretary a completed application and the factual assertions in the application must be true and must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. The application explains the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge and requires the borrower to—

      (i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—

      (A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986, to attend a school;

      (B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew from the school not more than 180 calendar days before the school closed. The Secretary may extend the 180-day period if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances, as described in paragraph (h) of this section, justify an extension; and

      (C) On or after July 1, 2023, state that the borrower did not complete the program at another branch or location of the school or through a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency.

      (ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and

      (iii) State that the borrower (or student)—

      (A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and

      (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (e)  (1) To obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower must cooperate with the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the borrower must—

      (i) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the borrower to support a request for discharge;

      (ii) Produce any documents reasonably available to the borrower with respect to those representations; and

      (iii) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement regarding those documents and representations.

      (2) The Secretary denies the request for a discharge or revokes the discharge of a borrower who—

      (i) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or

      (ii) Provides testimony, documents, or a sworn statement that does not support the material representations made by the borrower to obtain the discharge.

      (f)  (1) Upon discharge under this section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.

      (3) Nothing in this section limits or forecloses the borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters unrelated to the discharged Direct Loan.

      (g)  (1) After confirming the date of a school's closure, the Secretary identifies any Direct Loan borrower (or student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school closure date or to have withdrawn not more than 180 days prior to the closure date.

      (2) If the borrower's current address is known, the Secretary mails the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.

      (3) If the borrower's current address is unknown, the Secretary attempts to locate the borrower and determines the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge under this section by consulting with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the school's accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends collection, as described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

      (4) If a borrower fails to submit the application described in paragraph (d) of this section within 90 days of the Secretary's providing the discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended.

      (5) Upon resuming collection on any affected loan, the Secretary provides the borrower another discharge application and an explanation of the requirements and procedures for obtaining a discharge.

      (6) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a discharge meets the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination.

      (7) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a discharge does not meet the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination and the reasons for the determination.

      (h)  For purposes of this section, exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to—

      (1) The revocation or withdrawal by an accrediting agency of the school's institutional accreditation;

      (2) The school is or was placed on probation or issued a show-cause order, or was placed on an equivalent accreditation status, by its accrediting agency for failing to meet one or more of the agency's standards;

      (3) The revocation or withdrawal by the State authorization or licensing authority to operate or to award academic credentials in the State;

      (4) The termination by the Department of the school's participation in a title IV, HEA program;

      (5) A finding by a State or Federal government agency that the school violated State or Federal law related to education or services to students;

      (6) A State or Federal court judgment that a School violated State or Federal law related to education or services to students;

      (7) The teach-out of the student's educational program exceeds the 180-day look-back period for a closed school discharge;

      (8) The school responsible for the teach-out of the student's educational program fails to perform the material terms of the teach-out plan or agreement, such that the student does not have a reasonable opportunity to complete his or her program of study;

      (9) The school discontinued a significant share of its academic programs;

      (10) The school permanently closed all or most of its in-person locations while maintaining online programs; and

      (11) The school was placed on the heightened cash monitoring payment method as defined in § 668.162(d)(2) of this chapter.

      § 685.215   Discharge for false certification of student eligibility or unauthorized payment.

#### § § 685.215

      (a) —(1)  The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if a school falsely certifies the eligibility of the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) to receive the proceeds of a Direct Loan. The Secretary considers a student's eligibility to borrow to have been falsely certified by the school if the school—

      (i) Certified the eligibility of a student who—

      (A) Reported not having a high school diploma or its equivalent; and

      (B) Did not satisfy the alternative to graduation from high school requirements under section 484(d) of the Act and 34 CFR 668.32(e) of this chapter that were in effect when the loan was originated;

      (ii) Certified the eligibility of a student who is not a high school graduate based on—

      (A) A high school graduation status falsified by the school; or

      (B) A high school diploma falsified by the school or a third party to which the school referred the borrower;

      (iii) Signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization;

      (iv) Certified the eligibility of the student who, because of a physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason accepted by the Secretary, would not meet State requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence when the loan was originated) in the occupation for which the training program supported by the loan was intended; or

      (v) Certified the eligibility of a student for a Direct Loan as a result of the crime of identity theft committed against the individual, as that crime is defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.

      (2)  The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the proceeds of the loan were delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.

      (3)  For purposes of this section, a loan is originated when the school submits the loan record to the Department's Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. Before originating a Direct Loan, a school must determine the student's or parent's eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a student or parent, the school must first submit a loan award record to the COD system and receive an accepted response.

      (b)  (1) Discharge for false certification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges and collection costs with respect to the loan.

      (2) Discharge for unauthorized payment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section relieves the borrower of the obligation to repay the amount of the payment discharged.

      (3) The discharge under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the discharged loan or payment.

      (4) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.

      (5) The Secretary reports the discharge under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.

      (c)  To qualify for discharge under this paragraph, the borrower must submit to the Secretary an application for discharge on a form approved by the Secretary. The application need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury; and in the application, the borrower's responses must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section have been met. If the Secretary determines the application does not meet the requirements, the Secretary notifies the applicant and explains why the application does not meet the requirements.

      (1)  In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on not having a high school diploma and not having met the alternative to graduation from high school eligibility requirements under section 484(d) of the Act and 34 CFR 668.32(e) of this chapter as applicable when the loan was originated, and the school or a third party to which the school referred the borrower falsified the student's high school diploma, the borrower must state in the application that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent received a PLUS loan)—

      (i) Reported not having a valid high school diploma or its equivalent when the loan was originated; and

      (ii) Did not satisfy the alternative to graduation from high school statutory or regulatory eligibility requirements identified on the application form and applicable when the loan was originated.

      (2)  In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on a condition that would disqualify the borrower from employment in the occupation that the training program for which the borrower received the loan was intended, the borrower must state in the application that the borrower (or student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) did not meet State requirements for employment in the student's State of residence in the occupation that the training program for which the borrower received the loan was intended because of a physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason accepted by the Secretary.

      (3)  In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization, the borrower must state that he or she did not sign the document in question or authorize the school to do so.

      (4)  In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, the borrower must—

      (i) State that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign the authorization for electronic funds transfer or authorize the school to do so; and

      (ii) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.

      (5)  In the case of an individual whose eligibility to borrow was falsely certified because he or she was a victim of the crime of identity theft and is requesting a discharge, the individual must—

      § 685.216   Unpaid refund discharge.

#### § § 685.216

      (a)(1)  In the case of a school that has closed, the Secretary discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of a Direct Loan equal to the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable law and regulations, including this section. Any accrued interest and other charges associated with the unpaid refund are also discharged.

      (2)  (i) In the case of a school that is open, the Secretary discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of a Direct Loan equal to the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable law and regulations, including this section, if—

      (A) The borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) is not attending the school that owes the refund;

      (B) The borrower has been unable to resolve the unpaid refund with the school; and

      (C) The Secretary is unable to resolve the unpaid refund with the school within 120 days from the date the borrower submits a complete application in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section regarding the unpaid refund. Any accrued interest and other charges associated with the unpaid refund are also discharged.

      (ii) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section, within 60 days of the date notified by the Secretary, the school must submit to the Secretary documentation demonstrating that the refund was made by the school or that the refund was not required to be made by the school.

      (b)  (1) If the borrower receives a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, the borrower is reimbursed for any amounts paid in excess of the remaining balance of the loan (including accrued interest and other charges) owed by the borrower at the time of discharge.

      (2) The Secretary reports the discharge of a portion of a loan under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan.

      (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to receive a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit a written application to the Secretary. The application requests the information required to calculate the amount of the discharge and requires the borrower to sign a statement swearing to the accuracy of the information in the application. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must—

      (i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—

      (A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;

      (B) Did not attend, withdrew, or was terminated from the school within a timeframe that entitled the borrower to a refund; and

      (C) Did not receive the benefit of a refund to which the borrower was entitled either from the school or from a third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program;

      (ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has any other application for discharge pending for this loan; and

      (iii) State that the borrower (or student)—

      (A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and

      (B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions as described in § 685.214(d) and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary as described in § 685.214(e).

      (2) The Secretary may discharge a portion of a loan under this section without an application if the Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.

      (d)  (1) The Secretary determines the amount eligible for discharge based on information showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate refund formula to information that the borrower provides or that is otherwise available to the Secretary. For purposes of this section, all unpaid refunds are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.

      (2) If the information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not available, the Secretary uses the following formulas to determine the amount eligible for discharge:

      (i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary discharges the lesser of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The Secretary determines the amount of the institutional charges unearned by—

      (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and

      (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges assessed the student for the loan period.

      (ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary discharges the loan amount unearned. The Secretary determines the loan amount unearned by—

      (A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and

      (B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV grants and loans received by the student, or, if unknown, the loan amount.

      (iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period, the Secretary does not discharge any amount because a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is not entitled to a refund.

      (e)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the Secretary learns that a school did not make a refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, the Secretary sends the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.

      (2) If a borrower who is sent a discharge application fails to submit the application within 60 days of the Secretary's sending the discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

      (3) If a borrower qualifies for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing. The Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest on the portion of the loan not discharged for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

      (4) If a borrower does not qualify for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the reasons for the determination. The Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

      (d)  (1) A borrower may obtain a Direct Consolidation Loan if the borrower meets the following requirements:

      (i) On the loans being consolidated, the borrower is—

      (A) At the time the borrower applies for the Direct Consolidation Loan—

      () In the grace period;

      (i) The borrower has a Federal Consolidation Loan that is in default or has been submitted to the guaranty agency by the lender for default aversion, and the borrower wants to consolidate the Federal Consolidation Loan into the Direct Loan Program for the purpose of obtaining an income-contingent repayment plan or an income-based repayment plan; or

      (ii) The borrower has a Federal Consolidation Loan and the borrower wants to consolidate that loan into the Direct Loan Program for the purpose of using the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program or the no accrual of interest benefit for active duty service.

      (3) Eligible loans received before or after the date a Direct Consolidation Loan is made may be added to a subsequent Direct Consolidation Loan.

      (e)  To obtain a Direct Consolidation Loan, a borrower must submit a completed application to the Secretary.

      (i)  (1) Except as noted in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the repayment period for a Direct Consolidation Loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed.

      (2)(i)  The Secretary determines the repayment period under § 685.208(i) on the basis of the outstanding balances on all of the borrower's loans that are eligible for consolidation and the balances on other education loans except as provided in paragraphs (i)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.

      (ii) Borrowers entering repayment on or after July 1, 2006.

      (3)(i) The total amount of outstanding balances on the other education loans used to determine the repayment period under §§ 685.208(i) and (j) may not exceed the amount of the Direct Consolidation Loan.

      (ii) The borrower may not be in default on the other education loan unless the borrower has made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the holder of the loan.

      (iii) The lender of the other educational loan may not be an individual.

      (4) A Direct Consolidation Loan that was made based on an application received before July 1, 2006 receives a grace period if it includes a Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loan for which the borrower was in an in-school period at the time of consolidation. The repayment period begins the day after the grace period ends.

      (j)  (1) The Secretary provides a borrower of a Direct Consolidation Loan a repayment schedule before the borrower's first payment is due. The repayment schedule identifies the borrower's monthly repayment amount under the repayment plan selected.

      (2) If a borrower adds an eligible loan to the consolidation loan under paragraph (e) of this section, the Secretary makes appropriate adjustments to the borrower's monthly repayment amount and repayment period.

      (k)  If a lender receives a refund or return of title IV, HEA program funds from a school on a loan that has been consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan, the lender must transmit the refund or return and an explanation of the source of the refund or return to the Secretary within 30 days of receipt.

      (l)  The provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section apply to a Direct Consolidation Loan obtained by two married borrowers in accordance with the regulations that were in effect for consolidation applications received prior to July 1, 2006.

      (1)  To obtain a deferment on a joint Direct Consolidation Loan under § 685.204, both borrowers must meet the requirements of that section.

      (ii) If a borrower meets the requirements for total and permanent disability discharge under § 685.212(b), the Secretary discharges an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding balance of the consolidation loan, as of the date the borrower became totally and permanently disabled, attributable to any of that borrower's loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.

      (iii) If a borrower meets the requirements for discharge under § 685.212(d), (e), or (f) on a loan that was consolidated into a joint Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary discharges the portion of the consolidation loan equal to the amount of the loan that would be eligible for discharge under the provisions of § 685.212(d), (e), or (f) as applicable, and that was repaid by the consolidation loan.

      (iv) If a borrower meets the requirements for loan forgiveness under § 685.212(h) on a loan that was consolidated into a joint Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary repays the portion of the outstanding balance of the consolidation loan attributable to the loan that would be eligible for forgiveness under the provisions of § 685.212(h), and that was repaid by the consolidation loan.

#### § § 685.221

      (a) The Secretary may provide an alternative repayment plan to a borrower who demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the terms and conditions of the repayment plans specified in §§ 685.208 and 685.209 are not adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances.

      (c) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives notification of the terms of the plan, the borrower may accept the plan or choose another repayment plan.

      (d) A borrower must repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment, not including periods of deferment and forbearance.

> [88 FR 43905, July 10, 2023]

      § 685.222   Borrower defenses and procedures for loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, and before July 1, 2020, and procedures for loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017.

#### § § 685.222

      (a)  (1) For loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, a borrower asserts and the Secretary considers a borrower defense in accordance with the provisions of § 685.206(c), unless otherwise noted in § 685.206(c).

      (2) For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, and before July 1, 2020, a borrower asserts and the Secretary considers a borrower defense in accordance with this section. To establish a borrower defense under this section, a preponderance of the evidence must show that the borrower has a borrower defense that meets the requirements of this section.

      (3) A violation by the school of an eligibility or compliance requirement in the Act or its implementing regulations is not a basis for a borrower defense under either this section or § 685.206(c) unless the violation would otherwise constitute a basis for a borrower defense under this section or § 685.206(c), as applicable.

      (4) For the purposes of this section and § 685.206(c), “borrower” means—

      (i) The borrower; and

      (ii) In the case of a Direct PLUS Loan, any endorsers, and for a Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent, the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed.

      (5) For the purposes of this section and § 685.206(c), a “borrower defense” refers to an act or omission of the school attended by the student that relates to the making of a Direct Loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided, and includes one or both of the following:

      (i) A defense to repayment of amounts owed to the Secretary on a Direct Loan, in whole or in part; and

      (ii) A right to recover amounts previously collected by the Secretary on the Direct Loan, in whole or in part.

      (6) If the borrower asserts both a borrower defense and any other objection to an action of the Secretary with regard to that Direct Loan, the order in which the Secretary will consider objections, including a borrower defense, will be determined as appropriate under the circumstances.

      (b)  The borrower has a borrower defense under this section if the borrower, whether as an individual or as a member of a class, or a governmental agency, has obtained against the school a nondefault, favorable contested judgment based on State or Federal law in a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction. A borrower may assert a borrower defense under this paragraph at any time.

      (c)  The borrower has a borrower defense under this section if the school the borrower received the Direct Loan to attend failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student. A borrower may assert a defense to repayment of amounts owed to the Secretary under this paragraph at any time after the breach by the school of its contract with the student. A borrower may assert a right to recover amounts previously collected by the Secretary under this paragraph not later than six years after the breach by the school of its contract with the student.

      (d)  (1) A borrower has a borrower defense under this section if the school or any of its representatives, or any institution, organization, or person with whom the school has an agreement to provide educational programs, or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services, made a substantial misrepresentation in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, that the borrower reasonably relied on to the borrower's detriment when the borrower decided to attend, or to continue attending, the school or decided to take out a Direct Loan. A borrower may assert, at any time, a defense to repayment under this paragraph (d) of amounts owed to the Secretary. A borrower may assert a claim under this paragraph (d) to recover funds previously collected by the Secretary not later than six years after the borrower discovers, or reasonably could have discovered, the information constituting the substantial misrepresentation.

      (2) For the purposes of this section, a designated Department official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section or a hearing official pursuant to paragraph (f), (g), or (h) of this section may consider, as evidence supporting the reasonableness of a borrower's reliance on a misrepresentation, whether the school or any of the other parties described in paragraph (d)(1) engaged in conduct such as, but not limited to:

      (i) Demanding that the borrower make enrollment or loan-related decisions immediately;

      (ii) Placing an unreasonable emphasis on unfavorable consequences of delay;

      (iii) Discouraging the borrower from consulting an adviser, a family member, or other resource;

      (iv) Failing to respond to the borrower's requests for more information including about the cost of the program and the nature of any financial aid; or

      (v) Otherwise unreasonably pressuring the borrower or taking advantage of the borrower's distress or lack of knowledge or sophistication.

      (e)  (1) To assert a borrower defense under this section, an individual borrower must—

      (i) Submit an application to the Secretary, on a form approved by the Secretary—

      (A) Certifying that the borrower received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, to attend the named school;

      (B) Providing evidence that supports the borrower defense; and

      (C) Indicating whether the borrower has made a claim with respect to the information underlying the borrower defense with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and

      (ii) Provide any other information or supporting documentation reasonably requested by the Secretary.

      (2) Upon receipt of a borrower's application submitted under this section, the Secretary—

      (i) If the borrower is not in default on the loan for which a borrower defense has been asserted, grants forbearance and—

      (A) Notifies the borrower of the option to decline the forbearance and to continue making payments on the loan; and

      (B) Provides the borrower with information about the availability of the income-contingent repayment plans under § 685.209 and the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221; or

      (ii) Provides the borrower with information about the availability of the income-driven repayment plans under § 685.209;

      (3) The Secretary designates a Department official to review the borrower's application submitted under this section to determine whether the application states a basis for a borrower defense, and resolves the claim through a fact-finding process conducted by the Department official.

      (i) As part of the fact-finding process, the Department official notifies the school of the borrower defense application and considers any evidence or argument presented by the borrower and also any additional information, including—

      (A) Department records;

      (B) Any response or submissions from the school; and

      (C) Any additional information or argument that may be obtained by the Department official.

      (ii) For borrower defense applications under this section, upon the borrower's request, the Department official identifies to the borrower the records the Department official considers relevant to the borrower defense. The Secretary provides to the borrower any of the identified records upon reasonable request of the borrower.

      (4) At the conclusion of the fact-finding process under this section, the Department official issues a written decision as follows:

      (i) If the Department official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the Department official notifies the borrower in writing of that determination and of the relief provided as described in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (ii) If the Department official denies the borrower defense in full or in part, the Department official notifies the borrower of the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, any portion of the loan that is due and payable to the Secretary, and whether the Secretary will reimburse any amounts previously collected, and informs the borrower that if any balance remains on the loan, the loan will return to its status prior to the borrower's submission of the application. The Department official also informs the borrower of the opportunity to request reconsideration of the claim based on new evidence pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.

      (5) The decision of the Department official under this section is final as to the merits of the claim and any relief that may be granted on the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing—

      (i) If the borrower defense is denied in full or in part, the borrower may request that the Secretary reconsider the borrower defense upon the identification of new evidence in support of the borrower's claim. “New evidence” is relevant evidence that the borrower did not previously provide and that was not identified in the final decision as evidence that was relied upon for the final decision. If accepted for reconsideration by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans; and

      (ii) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.

      (6) The Secretary may consolidate applications filed under this paragraph (e) that have common facts and claims, and resolve the borrowers' borrower defense claims as provided in paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section.

      (7) The Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect from the school the amount of relief resulting from a borrower defense under this section—

      (i) Within the six-year period applicable to the borrower defense under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section;

      (ii) At any time, for a borrower defense under paragraph (b) of this section; or

      (iii) At any time if during the period described in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the institution received notice of the claim. For purposes of this paragraph, notice includes receipt of—

      (A) Actual notice from the borrower, a representative of the borrower, or the Department of a claim, including notice of an application filed pursuant to this section or § 685.206(c);

      (B) A class action complaint asserting relief for a class that may include the borrower for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c);

      (C) Written notice, including a civil investigative demand or other written demand for information, from a Federal or State agency that has power to initiate an investigation into conduct of the school relating to specific programs, periods, or practices that may have affected the borrower, for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c).

      (f)  (1) Upon consideration of factors including, but not limited to, common facts and claims, fiscal impact, and the promotion of compliance by the school or other title IV, HEA program participant, the Secretary may initiate a process to determine whether a group of borrowers, identified by the Secretary, has a borrower defense under this section.

      (i) The members of the group may be identified by the Secretary from individually filed applications pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section or from any other source.

      (ii) If the Secretary determines that there are common facts and claims that apply to borrowers who have not filed an application under paragraph (e) of this section, the Secretary may identify such borrowers as members of a group.

      (2) Upon the identification of a group of borrowers under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary—

      (i) Designates a Department official to present the group's claim in the fact-finding process described in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable;

      (ii) Provides each identified member of the group with notice that allows the borrower to opt out of the proceeding;

      (iii) If identified members of the group are borrowers who have not filed an application under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, follows the procedures in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans for such identified members of the group, unless an opt-out by such a member of the group is received; and

      (iv) Notifies the school of the basis of the group's borrower defense, the initiation of the fact-finding process described in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, and of any procedure by which the school may request records and respond. No notice will be provided if notice is impossible or irrelevant due to a school's closure.

      (3) For a group of borrowers identified by the Secretary, for which the Secretary determines that there may be a borrower defense under paragraph (d) of this section based upon a substantial misrepresentation that has been widely disseminated, there is a rebuttable presumption that each member reasonably relied on the misrepresentation.

      (g)  For groups identified by the Secretary under paragraph (f) of this section, for which the borrower defense under this section is asserted with respect to a Direct Loan to attend a school that has closed and has provided no financial protection currently available to the Secretary from which to recover any losses arising from borrower defenses, and for which there is no appropriate entity from which the Secretary can otherwise practicably recover such losses—

      (1) A hearing official resolves the borrower defense under this section through a fact-finding process. As part of the fact-finding process, the hearing official considers any evidence and argument presented by the Department official on behalf of the group and, as necessary to determine any claims at issue, on behalf of individual members of the group. The hearing official also considers any additional information the Department official considers necessary, including any Department records or response from the school or a person affiliated with the school as described in § 668.174(b), if practicable. The hearing official issues a written decision as follows:

      (i) If the hearing official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision states that determination and the relief provided on the basis of that claim as determined under paragraph (i) of this section.

      (ii) If the hearing official denies the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, the portion of the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary, and whether reimbursement of amounts previously collected is granted, and informs the borrowers that if any balance remains on the loan, the loan will return to its status prior to the group claim process.

      (iii) The Secretary provides copies of the written decision to the members of the group and, as practicable, to the school.

      (2) The decision of the hearing official is final as to the merits of the group borrower defense and any relief that may be granted on the group claim.

      (3) After a final decision has been issued, if relief for the group has been denied in full or in part pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, an individual borrower may file a claim for relief pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.

      (4) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.

      (h)  For groups identified by the Secretary under paragraph (f) of this section, for which the borrower defense under this section is asserted with respect to Direct Loans to attend a school that is not covered by paragraph (g) of this section, the claim is resolved in accordance with the procedures in this paragraph (h).

      (1) A hearing official resolves the borrower defense and determines any liability of the school through a fact-finding process. As part of the fact-finding process, the hearing official considers any evidence and argument presented by the school and the Department official on behalf of the group and, as necessary to determine any claims at issue, on behalf of individual members of the group. The hearing official issues a written decision as follows:

      (i) If the hearing official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision establishes the basis for the determination, notifies the members of the group of the relief as described in paragraph (i) of this section, and notifies the school of any liability to the Secretary for the amounts discharged and reimbursed.

      (ii) If the hearing official denies the borrower defense for the group in full or in part, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, the portion of the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary, and whether reimbursement of amounts previously collected is granted, and informs the borrowers that their loans will return to their statuses prior to the group borrower defense process. The decision notifies the school of any liability to the Secretary for any amounts discharged or reimbursed.

      (iii) The Secretary provides copies of the written decision to the members of the group, the Department official, and the school.

      (2) The decision of the hearing official becomes final as to the merits of the group borrower defense and any relief that may be granted on the group borrower defense within 30 days after the decision is issued and received by the Department official and the school unless, within that 30-day period, the school or the Department official appeals the decision to the Secretary. In the case of an appeal—

      (i) The decision of the hearing official does not take effect pending the appeal; and

      (ii) The Secretary renders a final decision.

      (3) After a final decision has been issued, if relief for the group has been denied in full or in part pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, an individual borrower may file a claim for relief pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.

      (4) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.

      (5)(i) The Secretary collects from the school any liability to the Secretary for any amounts discharged or reimbursed to borrowers under this paragraph (h).

      (ii) For a borrower defense under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect at any time.

      (iii) For a borrower defense under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect within the limitation period that would apply to the borrower defense, provided that the Secretary may bring an action to collect at any time if, within the limitation period, the school received notice of the borrower's borrower defense claim. For purposes of this paragraph, the school receives notice of the borrower's claim by receipt of—

      (A) Actual notice of the claim from the borrower, a representative of the borrower, or the Department, including notice of an application filed pursuant to this section or § 685.206(c);

      (B) A class action complaint asserting relief for a class that may include the borrower for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c); or

      (C) Written notice, including a civil investigative demand or other written demand for information, from a Federal or State agency that has power to initiate an investigation into conduct of the school relating to specific programs, periods, or practices that may have affected the borrower, of underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c).

      (i)  If a borrower defense is approved under the procedures in paragraph (e), (g), or (h) of this section, the following procedures apply:

      (1) The Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim determines the appropriate amount of relief to award the borrower, which may be a discharge of all amounts owed to the Secretary on the loan at issue and may include the recovery of amounts previously collected by the Secretary on the loan, or some lesser amount.

      (2) For a borrower defense brought on the basis of—

      (i) A substantial misrepresentation, the Department official or the hearing official will factor the borrower's cost of attendance to attend the school, as well as the value of the education the borrower received, the value of the education that a reasonable borrower in the borrower's circumstances would have received, and/or the value of the education the borrower should have expected given the information provided by the institution, into the determination of appropriate relief. A borrower may be granted full, partial, or no relief. Value will be assessed in a manner that is reasonable and practicable. In addition, the Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim may consider any other relevant factors;

      (ii) A judgment against the school—

      (A) Where the judgment awards specific financial relief, relief will be the amount of the judgment that remains unsatisfied, subject to the limitation provided for in § 685.222(i)(8) and any other reasonable considerations; and

      (B) Where the judgment does not award specific financial relief, the Department will rely on the holding of the case and applicable law to monetize the judgment; and

      (iii) A breach of contract, relief will be determined according to the common law of contracts, subject to the limitation provided for in § 685.222(i)(8) and any other reasonable considerations.

      (3) In a fact-finding process brought against an open school under paragraph (h) of this section on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, the school has the burden of proof as to any value of the education.

      (4) In determining the relief, the Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim may consider—

      (i) Information derived from a sample of borrowers from the group when calculating relief for a group of borrowers; and

      (ii) The examples in Appendix A to this subpart.

      (5) In the written decision described in paragraphs (e), (g), and (h) of this section, the designated Department official or hearing official deciding the claim notifies the borrower of the relief provided and—

      (i) Specifies the relief determination;

      (ii) Advises that there may be tax implications; and

      (iii) Advises the borrower of the requirements to file a request for reconsideration upon the identification of new evidence.

      (6) Consistent with the determination of relief under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the Secretary discharges the borrower's obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay and, if applicable, reimburses the borrower for amounts paid toward the loan voluntarily or through enforced collection.

      (7) The Department official or the hearing official deciding the case, or the Secretary as applicable, affords the borrower such further relief as appropriate under the circumstances. Such further relief includes, but is not limited to, one or both of the following:

      (i) Determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.

      (ii) Updating reports to consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's Direct Loan.

      (8) The total amount of relief granted with respect to a borrower defense cannot exceed the amount of the loan and any associated costs and fees and will be reduced by the amount of any refund, reimbursement, indemnification, restitution, compensatory damages, settlement, debt forgiveness, discharge, cancellation, compromise, or any other financial benefit received by, or on behalf of, the borrower that was related to the borrower defense. The relief to the borrower may not include non-pecuniary damages such as inconvenience, aggravation, emotional distress, or punitive damages.

      (j)  To obtain relief under this section, a borrower must reasonably cooperate with the Secretary in any proceeding under paragraph (e), (g), or (h) of this section. The Secretary may revoke any relief granted to a borrower who fails to satisfy his or her obligations under this paragraph (j).

      (k)  (1) Upon the granting of any relief under this section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to, and relinquished in favor of, the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the contract for educational services for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates, and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund. If the borrower asserts a claim to, and recovers from, a public fund, the Secretary may reinstate the borrower's obligation to repay on the loan an amount based on the amount recovered from the public fund, if the Secretary determines that the borrower's recovery from the public fund was based on the same borrower defense and for the same loan for which the discharge was granted under this section.

      (2) The provisions of this paragraph (k) apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those rights by the borrower, limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.

      (3) Nothing in this paragraph (k) limits or forecloses the borrower's right to pursue legal and equitable relief against a party described in this paragraph (k) for recovery of any portion of a claim exceeding that assigned to the Secretary or any other claims arising from matters unrelated to the claim on which the loan is discharged.

      (1) Identify eligible students who seek student financial assistance at the institution in accordance with section 484 of the Act;

      (2) Estimate the need of each of these students as required by part F of the Act for an academic year. For purposes of estimating need, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or any loan obtained under any State-sponsored or private loan program may be used to offset the expected family contribution of the student for that year;

      (3) Certify that the amount of the loan for any student under part D of the Act is not in excess of the annual limit applicable for that loan program and that the amount of the loan, in combination with previous loans received by the borrower, is not in excess of the aggregate limit for that loan program;

      (7) Provide assurances that the school will comply with loan information requirements established by the Secretary with respect to loans made under the Direct Loan Program;

      (8) Accept responsibility and financial liability stemming from its failure to perform its functions pursuant to the agreement;

      (9) Provide for the implementation of a quality assurance system, as established by the Secretary and developed in consultation with the school, to ensure that the school is complying with program requirements and meeting program objectives;

      (10) Provide that the school will not charge any fees of any kind, however described, to student or parent borrowers for origination activities or for the provision of information necessary for a student or parent to receive a loan under part D of the Act or for any benefits associated with such a loan;

      (11) Comply with the provisions of paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section regarding student claims and disputes;

      (12) Comply with other provisions that the Secretary determines are necessary to protect the interests of the United States and to promote the purposes of part D of the Act; and

      (3) Required provisions and notices: (i) After the effective date of this regulation, the school must include the following provision in any agreements with a student recipient of a Direct Loan for attendance at the school, or a student for whom the PLUS loan was obtained, that include pre-dispute arbitration or any other pre-dispute agreement addressing class actions: “We agree that this agreement cannot be used to stop you from being part of a class action lawsuit in court. You may file a class action lawsuit in court, or you may be a member of a class action lawsuit even if you do not file it.

      (A)  “We agree that neither we, nor anyone else who later becomes a party to this agreement, will use it to stop you from being part of a class action lawsuit in court. You may file a class action lawsuit in court, or you may be a member of a class action lawsuit in court even if you do not file it. This provision applies only to class action claims concerning our acts or omissions regarding the making of the Federal Direct Loan or the provision by us of educational services for which the Federal Direct Loan was obtained.

#### § § 685.301

      (a)  (1) A school participating in the Direct Loan Program must ensure that any information it provides to the Secretary in connection with loan origination is complete and accurate. A school must originate a Direct Loan while the student meets the borrower eligibility requirements of § 685.200. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E, a school may rely in good faith upon statements made by the borrower and, in the case of a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower, the student and the parent borrower.

      (2) A school must provide to the Secretary borrower information that includes but is not limited to—

      (i) The borrower's eligibility for a loan, as determined in accordance with § 685.200 and § 685.203;

If the borrower is eligible for a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but has not requested the maximum Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount for which the borrower is eligible, the school must—

      (i) Notify the graduate or professional student borrower of the maximum Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount that he or she is eligible to receive and provide the borrower with a comparison of—

      (B) Periods when interest accrues on a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and periods when interest accrues on a Direct PLUS Loan; and

      (ii) Give the graduate or professional student borrower the opportunity to request the maximum Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount for which the borrower is eligible.

      (4) A school may not originate a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan, or a combination of loans, for an amount that—

      (i) The school has reason to know would result in the borrower exceeding the annual or maximum loan amounts in § 685.203; or

      (ii) Exceeds the student's estimated cost of attendance less—

      (A) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; and

      (B) In the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.

      (5)(i) A school determines a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount in accordance with § 685.203.

      (ii) When prorating a loan amount for a student enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, the school need not recalculate the amount of the loan if the number of hours for which an eligible student is enrolled changes after the school originates the loan.

      (6) The date of loan origination is the date a school creates the electronic loan origination record.

      (7) If a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan that is $200 or less, a school may choose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan for that student and to include the amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

      (8) A school may refuse to originate a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the loan if the reason for that action is documented and provided to the borrower in writing, and if—

      (i) The determination is made on a case-by-case basis;

      (ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in the student's file; and

      (iii) The school does not engage in any pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to Direct Loans because of the borrower's race, gender, color, religion, national origin, age, disability status, or income.

      (9) A school may not assess a fee for the completion or certification of any Direct Loan Program forms or information or for the origination of a Direct Loan.

      (10)(i) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may originate a Direct Loan is—

      (A) At a school that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or that has terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, a single academic term (e.g., a semester or quarter); or

      (B) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) or (iii) of this section, at a school that measures academic progress in clock hours, or measures academic progress in credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system and does not have terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, the lesser of—

      () The length of the student's program (or the remaining portion of that program if the student has less than the full program remaining) at the school; or

      () The academic year as defined by the school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.3.

      (ii) For a student who transfers into a school from another school and the prior school originated a loan for a period of enrollment that overlaps the period of enrollment at the new school, the new school may originate a loan for the remaining portion of the program or academic year. In this case the school may originate a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit.

      (iii) For a student who completes a program at a school, where the student's last loan to complete that program had been for less than an academic year, and the student then begins a new program at the same school, the school may originate a loan for the remainder of the academic year. In this case the school may originate a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the loan level associated with the new program.

      (iv) The maximum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan is—

      (A) Generally an academic year, as defined by the school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.3, except that the school may use a longer period of time corresponding to the period to which the school applies the annual loan limits under § 685.203; or

      (B) For a defaulted borrower who has regained eligibility, the academic year in which the borrower regained eligibility.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary provides promissory notes for use in the Direct Loan Program. A school may not modify, or make any additions to, the promissory note without the Secretary's prior written approval.

      (2) A school that originates a loan must ensure that the loan is supported by a completed promissory note as proof of the borrower's indebtedness.

      (c)  The Secretary accepts a student's Payment Data that is submitted in accordance with procedures established through publication in the  and that contains information the Secretary considers to be accurate in light of other available information including that previously provided by the student and the institution.

#### § § 685.303

      (a)  This section establishes rules governing a school's processing of a borrower's Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan proceeds. The school must also comply with any rules for processing loan proceeds contained in 34 CFR part 668.

      (b) —(1) A school may not disburse loan proceeds to a borrower unless the borrower has executed a legally enforceable promissory note.

      (2) The Secretary provides Direct Loan funds to a school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.162.

      (ii) If a student delays attending school for a period of time, the school may consider that student to have maintained eligibility for the loan from the first day of the period of enrollment. However, the school must comply with the requirements under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (iii) If, after a school makes the first disbursement to a borrower, the student becomes ineligible due solely to the school's loss of eligibility to participate in the title IV programs or the Direct Loan Program, the school may make subsequent disbursements to the borrower as permitted by 34 CFR part 668.

      (iv) If, prior to making any disbursement to a borrower, the student temporarily ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the school may make a disbursement and any subsequent disbursement to the student if the school determines and documents in the student's file—

      (B) The student's revised cost of attendance; and

      § 685.304   Counseling borrowers.

#### § § 685.304

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a school must ensure that entrance counseling is conducted with each Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan student borrower prior to making the first disbursement of the proceeds of a loan to a student borrower unless the student borrower has received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Federal SLS Loan.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a school must ensure that entrance counseling is conducted with each graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrower prior to making the first disbursement of the loan unless the student borrower has received a prior student Direct PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan.

      (3) Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers must provide the borrower with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan and on the responsibilities of the borrower with respect to the loan. This information may be provided to the borrower—

      (i) During an entrance counseling session, conducted in person;

      (ii) On a separate written form provided to the borrower that the borrower signs and returns to the school; or

      (iii) Online or by interactive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.

      () In person; or

      () On a separate written or electronic document provided to the borrower.

      (4) If entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and completes the entrance counseling, which may include completion of any interactive program that tests the borrower's understanding of the terms and conditions of the borrower's loans.

      (5) A school must ensure that an individual with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled in a correspondence, distance education, or study-abroad program approved for credit at the home institution, the student borrower may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan proceeds are disbursed.

      (6) Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers must—

      (i) Explain the use of a Master Promissory Note (MPN);

      (ii) Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the student borrower is assuming;

      (v) Inform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on—

      (A) A range of student levels of indebtedness of Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers, or student borrowers with Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS Loans depending on the types of loans the borrower has obtained; or

      (B) The average indebtedness of other borrowers in the same program at the same school as the borrower;

      (vi) To the extent practicable, explain the effect of accepting the loan to be disbursed on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student financial assistance;

      (vii) Provide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either the borrower or the Secretary;

      (viii) Inform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school;

      (x) Explain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws prior to completing the borrower's program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling, including information regarding the borrower's repayment options and loan consolidation;

      (xi) Provide information on the National Student Loan Data System and how the borrower can access the borrower's records; and

      (xii) Provide the name of and contact information for the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has any questions about the borrower's rights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan.

      (B) The average indebtedness of other borrowers in the same program at the same school;

      (ii) Inform the borrower of the option to pay interest on a PLUS Loan while the borrower is in school;

      (iii) For a graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrower who has received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the information specified in § 685.301(a)(3)(i)(A) through (a)(3)(i)(C); and

      (iv) For a graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrower who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, provide the information specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) through paragraph (a)(6)(xii) of this section.

      (8) A school may adopt an alternative approach for entrance counseling as part of the school's quality assurance plan described in § 685.300(b)(9).

      (b)  (1) A school must ensure that exit counseling is conducted with each Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower and graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan borrower shortly before the student borrower ceases at least half-time study at the school.

      (2) The exit counseling must be in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the school must ensure that an individual with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved for credit at the home institution, the student borrower may be provided with written counseling materials within 30 days after the student borrower completes the program.

      (3) If a student borrower withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or fails to complete the exit counseling as required, exit counseling must, within 30 days after the school learns that the student borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to complete the exit counseling as required, be provided either through interactive electronic means, by mailing written counseling materials to the student borrower at the student borrower's last known address, or by sending written counseling materials to an email address provided by the student borrower that is not an email address associated with the school sending the counseling materials.

      (4) The exit counseling must—

      (i) Inform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower's indebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have obtained Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans, student borrowers who have obtained only Direct PLUS Loans, or student borrowers who have obtained Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS Loans, depending on the types of loans the student borrower has obtained, for attendance at the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;

      (ii) Review for the student borrower available repayment plan options including the standard repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, income-contingent repayment, and income-based repayment plans, including a description of the different features of each plan and sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and total payments under each plan;

      (B) The effects of consolidation on a borrower's underlying loan benefits, including grace periods, loan forgiveness, cancellation, and deferment opportunities;

      (C) The options of the borrower to prepay the loan and to change repayment plans; and

      (D) That borrower benefit programs may vary among different lenders;

      (v) Include debt-management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;

      (vi) Explain to the student borrower how to contact the party servicing the student borrower's Direct Loans;

      (vii) Meet the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), and (a)(6)(iv) of this section;

      (viii) Describe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures under Federal law, and litigation;

      (x) Review for the student borrower information on the availability of the Department's Student Loan Ombudsman's office;

      (xi) Inform the student borrower of the availability of title IV loan information in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and how NSLDS can be used to obtain title IV loan status information;

      (xii) A general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers; and

      (xiii) Require the student borrower to provide current information concerning name, address, social security number, references, and driver's license number and State of issuance, as well as the student borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the student borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the student borrower's expected employer (if known).

      (5) The school must ensure that the information required in paragraph (b)(4)(xiii) of this section is provided to the Secretary within 60 days after the student borrower provides the information.

      (6) If exit counseling is conducted through interactive electronic means, a school must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and completes the exit counseling.

      (7) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.

      (8)(i) For students who have received loans under both the FFEL Program and the Direct Loan Program for attendance at a school, the school's compliance with the exit counseling requirements in paragraph (b) of this section satisfies the exit counseling requirements in 34 CFR 682.604(a) if the school ensures that the exit counseling also provides the borrower with the information described in 34 CFR 682.604(a)(2)(i) and (ii).

      (ii) A student's completion of electronic interactive exit counseling offered by the Secretary satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and, for students who have also received FFEL Program loans for attendance at the school, 34 CFR 682.604(a).

      and  may be used interchangeably and include an eligible _institution_ as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services.

      means a  or  as defined in § 685.401(a).

      (b)  A borrower with a balance due on a covered loan will be determined to have a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan under this subpart, if at any time the Department concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the institution committed an actionable act or omission and, as a result, the borrower suffered detriment of a nature and degree warranting the relief provided by a borrower defense to repayment as defined in this section. An actionable act or omission means—

      (1) The institution made a substantial misrepresentation as defined in 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, that misled the borrower in connection with the borrower's decision to attend, or to continue attending, the institution or the borrower's decision to take out a covered loan;

      (2) The institution made a substantial omission of fact, as defined in 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, in connection with the borrower's decision to attend, or to continue attending, the institution or the borrower's decision to take out a covered loan;

      (3) The institution failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student and such obligation was undertaken as consideration or in exchange for the borrower's decision to attend, or to continue attending, the institution, for the borrower's decision to take out a covered loan, or for funds disbursed in connection with a covered loan;

      (4) The institution engaged in aggressive and deceptive recruitment conduct or tactics as defined in 34 CFR part 668, subpart R, in connection with the borrower's decision to attend, or to continue attending, the institution or the borrower's decision to take out a covered loan; or,

      (5)(i) The borrower, whether as an individual or as a member of a class, or a governmental agency has obtained against the institution a favorable judgment based on State or Federal law in a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction based on the institution's act or omission relating to the making of covered loan, or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided; or,

      (ii) The Secretary sanctioned or otherwise took adverse action against the institution at which the borrower enrolled under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, by denying the institution's application for recertification, or revoking the institution's provisional program participation agreement under 34 CFR 668.13, based on the institution's acts or omissions that could give rise to a borrower defense claim under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

      (c)  For loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, a borrower has a borrower defense to repayment under this subpart if the Secretary concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the school attended by the student committed any act or omission that relates to the making of the loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable State law without regard to any State statute of limitations, but only upon reconsideration described under § 685.407(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(i).

      (d)  An institution's violation of an eligibility or compliance requirement in the Act or its implementing regulations is not a basis for a borrower defense under this subpart unless the violation would otherwise constitute a basis for a borrower defense under this subpart.

      (e)  In determining whether a detriment caused by an institution's act or omission warrants relief under this section, the Secretary will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the nature and degree of the acts or omissions and of the detriment caused to borrowers. For borrowers who attended a closed school shown to have committed actionable acts or omissions that caused the borrower detriment, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the detriment suffered warrants relief under this section.

      § 685.402   Group process for borrower defense.

#### § § 685.402

      (a)  Upon consideration of factors including, but not limited to, the existence of common facts and claims by borrowers, the likelihood of actionable acts or omissions that were pervasive or widely disseminated, and the promotion of compliance by an institution or other title IV, HEA program participant, the Secretary may determine whether a group of borrowers from one institution or commonly owned institutions identified by the Secretary has a borrower defense under this subpart.

      (b)  The Secretary may identify and form a group based upon information from sources that include but are not limited to—

      (1) Actions by the Federal Government, State attorneys general, other State agencies or officials, or other law enforcement activity;

      (2) Lawsuits related to educational programs filed against the institutions that are the subject of the claims or judgments rendered against the institutions; or,

      (3) Individual borrower defense claims pursuant to § 685.403.

      (c)  The Secretary will consider a request to form a group from a third-party requestor that complies with the requirements of this section. To comply with the requirements of this section, the requestor—

      (1) Submits an application to the Secretary, under penalty of perjury, and on a form approved by the Secretary that—

      (i) Identifies the requested group, including at minimum:

      (A) The name of the institution or commonly owned institutions;

      (B) The campuses or programs which are the subject of the claim, if applicable;

      (C) A description of the conduct that forms the basis for the group borrower defense claim under the Federal standard in § 685.401(b);

      (D) An analysis of why the conduct should result in an approved group borrower defense claim under the Federal standard in § 685.401(b); and,

      (E) The period during which the activity in (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section occurred;

      (ii) Provides evidence beyond sworn borrower statements that supports each element of the claim made in this paragraph (c)(1), including but not limited to evidence demonstrating the actionable acts or omissions asserted were pervasive or widely disseminated;

      (iii) Provides the names and other identifying information of borrowers in the group to the extent available; and

      (iv) For requests submitted by a legal assistance organization, includes a certification that the requestor has entered into a legal representation authority with each borrower identified as a member of the group; and,

      (2) Provides any other information or supporting documentation reasonably requested by the Secretary within 90 days of the Secretary's request.

      (3) The Secretary may consolidate multiple group applications related to the same institution or commonly owned institutions.

      (4) Once the Secretary determines that the third-party requestor's application is materially complete, the Secretary will provide notice to the institution of the third-party requestor's application. The institution will have 90 days to respond to the Secretary regarding the third-party requestor's application request to form a group under this paragraph (c).

      (5) The Secretary will provide a response to any materially complete third-party requestor group request under this paragraph (c) within two years of receipt. That response will be sent to the third-party requestor and the institution and includes:

      (i) Whether the Secretary will choose to form a group and a definition of the group formed; and

      (ii) Any additional information needed from the third-party requestor to continue the third-party requestor requested group process.

      (6)(i) If the Secretary denies in whole or in part a third-party requestor's request to form a group under the process described in this paragraph (c), for reasons other than that the Secretary already has formed a group that includes the members of the proposed group or has findings that cover the members of the proposed group, the third-party requestor submitting the group claim may request that the Secretary reconsider the decision upon the identification of new evidence that was not previously available to the Secretary in forming the group.

      (ii) The third-party requestor submitting the group claim under this paragraph (c) must request reconsideration of the group formation no later than 90 days from the date of the Secretary's initial decision regarding formation of the group.

      (iii) The Secretary will provide a response to the third-party requestor that requested reconsideration of the group's formation and the institution after reaching a decision on the reconsideration request.

      (d)  Upon formation of a group of borrowers under this section, the Secretary—

      (1) Designates a Department official to present the group's claim in the institutional response process described in § 685.405;

      (2) For borrowers who have an application pending with the Secretary prior to the formation of the group, notifies those borrowers that they are an identified member of the group formed under this section and follows § 685.403(d) or (e) as appropriate;

      (3) For borrowers whose names were submitted by the third-party requestor and that can be identified by the Secretary, or that can otherwise be identified by the Secretary, if the borrower is not in default and does not have a separate application pending with the Secretary, follows the procedures under § 685.403(d) except that interest on the loan will stop accumulating immediately;

      (4) For borrowers whose names were submitted by the third-party requestor and that can be identified by the Secretary, or that can otherwise be identified by the Secretary, if the borrower is in default and does not have a separate application pending with the Secretary, follows the procedures under § 685.403(e) except that the interest on the loan will stop accumulating immediately;

      (5) For possible group members that the Secretary cannot identify, takes reasonable steps to identify and notify potential members of the group, and if the Secretary ultimately is able to identify any additional members, follows the process under paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section to allow those additional members to opt-in the group formed; and,

      (6) If the Secretary later identifies a borrower that should have received the benefits as described under paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, either prior to the adjudication of the group or after an adjudication that results in the approval of a group borrower defense, retrospectively applies the benefits available to the borrower under those subparagraphs and no other consequences will apply.

      § 685.403   Individual process for borrower defense.

#### § § 685.403

      (a)  (1) If § 685.402 does not apply to an individual borrower who has submitted a borrower defense application, the Secretary will initiate a process to determine whether the individual borrower has a borrower defense under this subpart.

      (2) If § 685.402 applies to an individual borrower who is covered under a group borrower defense application being considered by the Secretary, that group borrower defense application will toll the timelines under § 685.406 on adjudicating the individual borrower application.

      (3) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to claims covered by a group claim under § 685.402, including claims submitted prior to the formation of such a group, until after the Secretary makes a decision on that group claim.

      (b)  (1) The Secretary will consider a borrower defense claim from an individual borrower to be materially complete when the borrower—

      (i) Submits an application to the Secretary, under penalty of perjury and on a form approved by the Secretary with the following information:

      (A) A description of one or more acts or omissions by the institution;

      (B) The school or school representative attributed with the act or omission;

      (C) Approximately when the act or omission occurred;

      (D) How the act or omission impacted their decision to attend, to continue attending, or to take out the loan for which they are asserting a defense to repayment; and,

      (E) A description of the detriment they suffered as a result of the institution's act or omission;

      (ii) Provides additional supporting evidence for the claims made under subparagraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if any;

      (2) The individual must provide any other information or supporting documentation reasonably requested by the Secretary.

      (d)  The Secretary grants forbearance on all of the borrower's title IV loans that are not in default in accordance with § 685.205 and—

      (1) Provides the borrower with information about the availability of the income-driven repayment plans under § 685.209;

      (2) Does not charge interest on the borrower's loans beginning 180 days from the date the borrower was initially granted forbearance under this paragraph (d) if the Secretary has failed to make a determination on the borrower's claim by that date and continuing until the Department notifies the borrower of the decision.

      (e)  The Secretary—

      (1) Suspends collection activity on all defaulted title IV loans until the Secretary issues a decision on the borrower defense claim;

      (2) Does not charge interest on the borrower's loans beginning 180 days from the date the Secretary initially suspended collection activity under subparagraph (e)(1) of this section if the Secretary has not made a determination on the borrower's claim by that date and continuing until the Department notifies the borrower of the decision;

      (3) Notifies the borrower of the suspension of collection activity and explains that collection activity will resume no earlier than 90 days following final adjudication of the borrower defense claim if the Secretary determines that the borrower does not qualify for a full discharge; and

      (4) Notifies the borrower of the option to begin or continue making payments under a rehabilitation agreement or other repayment agreement on the defaulted loan.

      (b) For groups based on prior Secretarial final actions in accordance with this section, § 685.405 will not apply to the affected institutions.

      § 685.405   Institutional response.

#### § § 685.405

      (a) For purposes of adjudicating a borrower defense claim other than those based on prior Secretarial final actions in accordance with § 685.404, the Department official notifies the institution of the group claim under § 685.402 or individual claim under § 685.403 and requests a response from the school. Such notification also may include, but is not limited to, requests for documentation to substantiate the school's response.

      (b)(1) The notification in paragraph (a) of this section tolls any limitation period by which the Secretary may recover from the institution under § 685.409.

      (2) The Department official requests a response from the institution, which will have 90 days to respond from the date of the Department official's notification.

      (c) With its response, the institution must submit an affidavit, on a form approved by the Secretary, certifying under penalty of perjury that the information submitted to the Department official is true and correct.

      (d) If the institution does not respond to the Department official's information request within 90 days, the Department official will presume that the institution does not contest the borrower defense to repayment claim.

      § 685.406   Adjudication of borrower defense applications.

#### § § 685.406

      (a)  The Department official adjudicates a borrower defense claim in accordance with this section.

      (b)  (1) For a group formed under § 685.402, the Department official makes a recommendation to the Secretary regarding adjudication after considering any evidence related to the claim, including materials submitted as part of the group application, individual claims that are part of the group, evidence in the Secretary's possession, evidence provided by the institution during the institutional response process described in § 685.405, and any other relevant information.

      (2) For a group of borrowers under § 685.402 for which the Department official determines that there may be a borrower defense under § 685.401(b), there is a rebuttable presumption that the act or omission giving rise to the borrower defense affected each member of the group in deciding to attend, or continue attending, the institution, and that such reliance was reasonable.

      (c)  For an individual process under § 685.403, the Department official adjudicates the borrower defense using the information available to the official and makes a recommendation to the Secretary regarding adjudication. The Department official considers any evidence related to the claim, including materials submitted as part of the individual application, evidence in the Secretary's possession, evidence provided by the institution during the institutional response process described in § 685.405, and any other relevant information.

      (ii) The Secretary places a borrower's Direct Loans associated with a group borrower defense claim into forbearance until the Secretary discharges the loan obligations under § 685.212(k). If any balance remains on the Direct Loans not associated with the borrower defense claim, those loans will return to their status prior to the claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on those Direct Loans not associated with the borrower defense claim no earlier than 90 days from the date the Department official issues a written decision. No interest will be charged on the loans during the forbearance period.

      (2) —(i)  If the Secretary denies the borrower defense claim, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence upon which the decision was based, and the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary. The Secretary informs the borrowers that for the Direct Loans associated with the group borrower defense claim, those loans will return to their status prior to the group claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on the Direct Loans associated with the group borrower defense claim no earlier than 90 days from the date the Secretary issues a written decision. The Secretary also informs individual borrowers from the group claim initially adjudicated under § 685.406(b)(1) of their option to file a new borrower defense application under an individual process in accordance with § 685.403.

      (ii)  If the Secretary denies the borrower defense claim, the written decision states the reasons for the denial and the evidence upon which the decision was based. The Secretary informs the borrowers that their loans will return to their status prior to the claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on the loans under which a forbearance or stopped collection was granted during adjudication of the claim in accordance with §§ 685.403(d) and (e), no earlier than 90 days from the date the Secretary issues a written decision. The Secretary also informs the borrower of the opportunity to request reconsideration of the claim pursuant to § 685.407.

      (3)  The Secretary provides copies of the written decision in this subsection to:

      (i) An individual whose claim was adjudicated under § 685.406(c), as applicable;

      (ii) The members of the group whose claims were adjudicated under § 685.406(b)(1), as applicable;

      (iii) The school; and,

      (iv) The third-party requestor who requested the group claims process, as applicable.

      (g)  (1) The Secretary will issue a decision on a group or individual borrower defense claim under the following timelines:

      (i) For a group claim under § 685.402(c), within 1 year of the date the Department official notified the third-party requestor under § 685.402(c)(5).

      (ii) For an individual claim under § 685.403, within the later of July 1, 2026 or 3 years after the date the Department determines the borrower submitted a materially complete application.

      (2) The timelines in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not apply for additional adjudications carried out as part of the reconsideration process in § 685.407.

      (3) An individual claim under § 685.403 that is included in a group claim under § 685.402 will be subject to the adjudication timeline for that group under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, and any timelines associated with individual adjudication in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will be tolled until the Secretary renders a decision on the claim under § 685.402.

      (4) The Department official will provide an interim update to the individual borrower submitting a claim under § 685.403, the third-party requestor requesting a group process under § 685.402, and the institution contacted for the institutional response under § 685.405 no later than 1 year after receipt of a materially complete application. Such notification will—

      (i) Indicate the Department official's progress in adjudicating the claim or claims; and,

      (ii) Provide an expected timeline for rendering a decision on the claim.

      (5) If the Secretary does not issue a written decision under paragraph (e) of this section on loans covered by certain claims by the dates identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the loans, or portion of the loans in the case of a Direct Consolidation Loan, will not be enforceable by the Department against the borrower and the school will not be liable for the loan amount.

      (e) The Department official adjudicates the borrower's reconsideration request under § 685.406, makes a recommendation to the Secretary, and the Secretary provides notice of the final decision upon reconsideration in accordance with § 685.406(f).

      (f)(1) The Secretary may reopen at any time a borrower defense application that was denied. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedures in § 685.403(d) for granting forbearance and for § 685.403(e) for defaulted loans, as applicable.

      (2) Upon reopening a borrower defense application under paragraph (f) of this section, the Department official adjudicates the claim under § 685.406, makes a recommendation to the Secretary, and the Secretary provides notice of the final decision on the reopened case in accordance with § 685.406(f).

**Source:** Source: 73 FR 35495, June 23, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Scope, Purpose, and General Definitions

      § 686.1   Scope and purpose.

#### § § 686.1

      The TEACH Grant program awards grants to students who intend to teach, to help meet the cost of their postsecondary education. In exchange for the grant, the student must agree to serve as a full-time teacher in a high-need field in a school serving low-income students, or as a full-time teacher in a high-need field for an educational service agency serving low-income students, for at least four academic years within eight years of ceasing enrollment at the institution where the student received the grant or, in the case of a student who receives a TEACH Grant at one institution and subsequently transfers to another institution and enrolls in another TEACH Grant-eligible program, within eight years of ceasing enrollment at the other institution. The eight-year period for completing the required four years of teaching does not include periods of suspension in accordance with § 686.41. If the student does not satisfy the service obligation, the amounts of the TEACH Grants received are treated as a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and must be repaid with interest charged from the date of each TEACH Grant disbursement. A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan can be reconverted to a grant only in accordance with § 686.43.

      (7) Explains that a grant recipient whose TEACH Grant was converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan based on a request from the recipient in accordance with § 686.43(a)(1)(i) may request that the Secretary reconvert the recipient's loan to a TEACH Grant as provided in § 686.43(a)(8); and

      (8) Requires the grant recipient to comply with the terms, conditions, and other requirements consistent with §§ 686.40 through 686.43 that the Secretary determines to be necessary.

      (c)  (1) A grant recipient must complete one service obligation for all TEACH Grants received for undergraduate study, and one service obligation for all TEACH Grants received for graduate study. Each service obligation begins when the grant recipient ceases enrollment at the institution where the TEACH Grants were received, or, in the case of a grant recipient who receives a TEACH Grant at one institution and subsequently transfers to another institution, within eight years from the date the grant recipient ceases enrollment at the other institution. However, creditable teaching service, a suspension approved under § 686.41(a)(2), or a military discharge granted under § 686.42(c)(2) may apply to more than one service obligation.

      (2) Unless paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies—

      (i) In the case of a TEACH Grant recipient who withdraws from an institution before completing a baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate program of study for which he or she received TEACH Grants, but later re-enrolls at the same institution or at a different institution in either the same baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate program or in a different TEACH Grant-eligible baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate program prior to the date that his or her TEACH Grants are converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans under § 686.43(a)(1)(ii) and receives additional TEACH Grants or the Secretary otherwise confirms that the grant recipient has re-enrolled in a TEACH Grant-eligible program, the Secretary adjusts the starting date of the period for completing the service obligation to begin when the grant recipient ceases to be enrolled at the institution where he or she has re-enrolled; and

      (ii) In the case of a TEACH Grant recipient who withdraws from an institution before completing a master's degree program of study for which he or she received TEACH Grants, but later re-enrolls at the same institution or at a different institution in either the same master's degree program or in a different TEACH Grant eligible master's degree program prior to the date that his or her TEACH Grants are converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans under § 686.43(a)(1)(ii) and receives additional TEACH Grants or the Secretary otherwise confirms that the grant recipient has re-enrolled in a TEACH Grant-eligible program, the Secretary adjusts the starting date of the period for completing the service obligation to begin when the grant recipient ceases to be enrolled at the institution where he or she has re-enrolled.

      (3) In the case of a TEACH Grant recipient covered under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section who completed one or more complete academic years of creditable teaching service as described in § 686.12(b) during the period between the grant recipient's withdrawal and re-enrollment—

      (i) The Secretary does not adjust the starting date of the period for completing the service obligation unless requested by the recipient;

      (ii) The completed teaching service counts toward satisfaction of the grant recipient's service obligation under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) If the grant recipient continues to perform creditable teaching service after re-enrolling in a TEACH Grant-eligible program, the grant recipient may receive credit toward satisfaction of the service obligation for any complete academic years of creditable teaching performed while the recipient is concurrently enrolled in the TEACH Grant-eligible program only if the recipient does not request and receive a temporary suspension of the period for completing the service obligation under § 686.41(a)(1)(i).

      (d)  For a grant recipient's teaching service in a high-need field listed in the Nationwide List to count toward satisfying the recipient's service obligation, the high-need field in which he or she prepared to teach must be listed in the Nationwide List for the State in which the grant recipient teaches—

      (1) For teaching service performed before July 1, 2010, at the time the grant recipient begins teaching in that field, even if that field subsequently loses its high-need designation for that State; or

      (2) For teaching service performed on or after July 1, 2010—

      (i) At the time the grant recipient begins teaching in that field, even if that field subsequently loses its high-need designation for that State; or

      (ii) At the time the grant recipient signed the agreement to serve or repay or received the TEACH Grant, even if that field subsequently loses its high-need designation for that State before the grant recipient begins teaching in that field.

      (ix) Emphasize that, once a TEACH Grant is converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it may be reconverted to a grant only if—

      (2) Subsequent counseling may be in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the institution must ensure that an individual with expertise in title IV, HEA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student enrolled in a correspondence program of study or a study-abroad program of study approved for credit at the home institution, the student may be provided with written counseling materials before the grant is disbursed.

      (4) The exit counseling must—

      (i) Review the terms and conditions of the TEACH Grant agreement to serve or repay as described in § 686.12 and emphasize to the grant recipient that the four-year service obligation must be completed within the eight-year period described in § 686.12;

      (ii) Explain the treatment of a grant recipient who withdraws from and then reenrolls in a TEACH Grant-eligible program at a TEACH Grant eligible institution as described in § 686.12(c);

      § 686.33   Frequency of payment.

#### § § 686.33

      (a) In each payment period, an institution may pay a student at such times and in such installments as it determines will best meet the student's needs.

      (b) The institution may pay funds in one lump sum for all the prior payment periods for which the student was eligible under § 686.11 within the award year as long as the student has signed the agreement to serve prior to disbursement of the TEACH Grant. The student's enrollment status must be determined according to work already completed.

      § 686.34   Liability for and recovery of TEACH Grant overpayments.

#### § § 686.34

      (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, a student is liable for any TEACH Grant overpayment made to him or her.

      (2) The institution is liable for a TEACH Grant overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution failed to follow the procedures set forth in this part or in 34 CFR part 668. The institution must restore an amount equal to the overpayment to its TEACH Grant account.

      (3) A student is not liable for, and the institution is not required to attempt recovery of or refer to the Secretary, a TEACH Grant overpayment if the amount of the overpayment is less than $25 and is not a remaining balance.

      (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if an institution makes a TEACH Grant overpayment for which it is not liable, it must promptly send a written notice to the student requesting repayment of the overpayment amount. The notice must state that failure to make the requested repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the TEACH Grant overpayment.

      (2) If a student objects to the institution's TEACH Grant overpayment determination, the institution must consider any information provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the student fails to repay a TEACH Grant overpayment or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the TEACH Grant overpayment, after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (b) of this section, the institution must refer the overpayment to the Secretary for collection in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the TEACH Grant overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further efforts to recover the overpayment.

#### § § 686.35

      (a)  (1) If the student's enrollment status changes from one academic term to another academic term within the same award year, the institution must recalculate the TEACH Grant award for the new payment period taking into account any changes in the cost of attendance.

      (2)(i) If the student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. Any such recalculations must take into account any changes in the cost of attendance. In the case of an undergraduate or post-baccalaureate program of study, if such a policy is established, it must be the same policy that the institution established under 34 CFR 690.80(b) for the Federal Pell Grant Program and it must apply to all students in the TEACH Grant-eligible program.

      (ii) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution must recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which he or she actually began attendance.

      (b)  If the student's cost of attendance changes at any time during the award year and his or her enrollment status remains the same, the institution may, but is not required to, establish a policy under which the student's TEACH Grant award for the payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students in the TEACH Grant-eligible program.

      § 686.36   Fiscal control and fund accounting procedures.

#### § § 686.36

#### § § 686.43

      (a)(1) The TEACH Grant amounts disbursed to the recipient will be converted into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, with interest accruing from the date that each grant disbursement was made and be collected by the Secretary in accordance with the relevant provisions of subpart A of 34 CFR part 685 if—

      (i) The grant recipient, regardless of enrollment status, requests that the TEACH Grant be converted into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan because he or she has decided not to teach in a qualified school or educational service agency, or not to teach in a high-need field, or for any other reason; or

      (ii) The grant recipient does not begin or maintain qualified employment within the timeframe that would allow that individual to complete the service obligation within the number of years required under § 686.12.

      (2) At least annually during the service obligation period under § 686.12, the Secretary notifies the grant recipient of—

      (i) The terms and conditions that the grant recipient must meet to satisfy the service obligation;

      (ii) The requirement for the grant recipient to provide to the Secretary, upon completion of each of the four required elementary or secondary academic years of teaching service, documentation of that teaching service on a form approved by the Secretary and certified by the chief administrative officer of the school or educational service agency in which the grant recipient taught and emphasizes the necessity to keep copies of this information and copies of the recipient's own employment documentation;

      (iii) The service years completed and the remaining timeframe within which the grant recipient must complete the service obligation;

      (iv) The conditions under which the grant recipient may request a temporary suspension of the period for completing the service obligation;

      (v) The conditions as described under paragraph (a)(1) of this section under which the TEACH Grant amounts disbursed to the recipient will be converted into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan;

      (vi) The potential total interest accrued;

      (vii) The process by which the recipient may contact the Secretary to request reconsideration of the conversion, the deadline by which the grant recipient must submit the request for reconsideration, and a list of the specific documentation required by the Secretary to reconsider the conversion; and

      (viii) An explanation that to avoid further accrual of interest as described in § 686.12(b)(4)(ii), a grant recipient who decides not to teach in a qualified school or field, or who for any other reason no longer intends to satisfy the service obligation, may request that the Secretary convert his or her TEACH Grant to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan that the grant recipient may begin repaying immediately, instead of waiting for the TEACH Grant to be converted to a loan under the condition described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

      (3) On or about 90 days before the date that a grant recipient's TEACH Grants would be converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary notifies the grant recipient of the date by which the recipient must submit documentation showing that the recipient is satisfying the obligation.

      (4) If the TEACH Grant amounts disbursed to a recipient are converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the Secretary notifies the recipient of the conversion and offers conversion counseling as described in § 686.32(e).

      (5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, if a grant recipient's TEACH Grant was converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the Secretary will reconvert the loan to a TEACH Grant based on documentation provided by the recipient or in the Secretary's records demonstrating that the recipient was satisfying the service obligation as described in § 686.12 or that the grant was converted to a loan in error.

      (6) If a grant recipient who requests reconsideration demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a TEACH Grant was converted to a loan in error, the Secretary—

      (i) Reconverts the loan to a TEACH Grant;

      (ii) Applies any academic years of qualifying teaching service that the grant recipient completed before or during the period when the grant was incorrectly in loan status toward the grant recipient's four-year service obligation requirement;

      (iii) Upon reconversion of the loan to a TEACH Grant, provides the grant recipient with an additional period of time, equal to eight years minus the number of full academic years of teaching that the recipient completed prior to the reconversion of the loan to a TEACH Grant, including any years of qualifying teaching completed during the period when the TEACH Grant was incorrectly in loan status, to complete the remaining portion of the service obligation.

      (iv) Ensures that the grant recipient receives credit for any payments that were made on the Direct Unsubsidized Loan that was reconverted to a TEACH Grant;

      (v) Notifies the recipient of the reconversion to a grant and explains that the recipient is once again responsible for meeting all requirements of the service obligation under § 686.12; and

      (vi) Requests deletion of any derogatory information reported to the consumer reporting agencies related to the grant while it was in loan status and furnishes a statement confirming that the grant was converted to a loan in error that the recipient may provide to creditors until the recipient's credit history has been corrected.

      (7) If a grant recipient who requests reconsideration does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a TEACH Grant was converted to a loan in error, the Secretary—

      (ii) Explains the reason or reasons why the loan cannot be converted to a TEACH Grant; and

      (iii) Explains how the recipient may contact the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman if he or she continues to believe that the TEACH Grant was converted to a loan in error.

      (8) In the case of a grant recipient whose TEACH Grant was converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will reconvert the loan to a grant and restore the recipient's service obligation if—

      (i) The grant recipient submits a request to the Secretary to reconvert the loan to a TEACH Grant;

      (ii) Excluding any periods of suspension granted under § 686.41, there is sufficient time remaining for the grant recipient to complete the required four academic years of qualifying teaching service within eight years from the date the grant recipient ceased enrollment at the institution where the recipient received the grant or, in the case of a student who received a TEACH Grant at one institution and subsequently transferred to another institution and enrolled in another TEACH Grant-eligible program, within eight years from the date the recipient ceased enrollment at the other institution; and

      (iii) In the case of a recipient who would not have sufficient time remaining to complete the service obligation within the eight-year period as described in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section unless the recipient qualifies for a suspension under § 686.40, which may be granted retroactively, the recipient requests and is determined to be eligible for the suspension.

      (9) A TEACH Grant recipient remains obligated to meet all requirements of the service obligation under § 686.12, even if the recipient does not receive the notices from the Secretary as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (b) A TEACH Grant that is converted to a loan, and is treated as a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, is not counted against the grant recipient's annual or aggregate loan limits under 34 CFR 685.203.

      (c) A grant recipient whose TEACH Grant has been converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan—

      (1) Enters a six-month grace period prior to entering repayment, and

      (6)  If an institution receives a waiver from the Secretary of the 30 weeks of instructional time requirement under 34 CFR 668.3, an institution may calculate a student's Federal Pell Grant payment for a payment period using the following methodologies:

      (i) If the program is offered in terms and credit hours, the institution uses the methodology in—

      (A) Paragraph (b) of this section provided that the program meets all the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that in lieu of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the program provides at least the same number of weeks of instructional time in the terms specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section as are in the program's academic year; or

      (B) Paragraph (d) of this section.

      (ii) The institution uses the methodology described in paragraph (e) of this section if the program is offered in credit hours without terms or clock hours.

      (iii) The institution uses the methodology described in § 690.66 if the program is correspondence study.

      (b)  The Federal Pell Grant for a payment period,  an academic term, for a student in a program using standard terms with at least 30 weeks of instructional time in two semesters or trimesters or in three quarters as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, is calculated by—

      (1) Determining his or her enrollment status for the term;

      (2) Based upon that enrollment status, determining his or her annual award from the Payment Schedule for full-time students or the Disbursement Schedule for three-quarter-time, half-time, or less-than-half-time students; and

      (3) Dividing the amount described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section by—

      (i) Two at institutions using semesters or trimesters or three at institutions using quarters; or

      (ii) The number of terms over which the institution chooses to distribute the student's annual award if—

      (B) The number of weeks of instructional time in the terms, including the additional term or terms, equals the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year.

      (c)  The Federal Pell Grant for a payment period,  an academic term, for a student in a program using standard terms with less than 30 weeks of instructional time in two semesters or trimesters or in three quarters as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, is calculated by—

      (1) Determining his or her enrollment status for the term;

      (2) Based upon that enrollment status, determining his or her annual award from the Payment Schedule for full-time students or the Disbursement Schedule for three-quarter-time, half-time, or less-than-half-time students;

      (3) Multiplying his or her annual award determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the following fraction as applicable:

      In a program using semesters or trimesters—

      In a program using quarters—

      (4)(i) Dividing the amount determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section by two for programs using semesters or trimesters or three for programs using quarters; or

      (A) An institution chooses to distribute all of the student's annual award determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section over more than two terms for programs using semesters or trimesters or more than three quarters for programs using quarters; and

      (B) The number of weeks of instructional time in the terms, including the additional term or terms, equals the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year definition.

      (d)  The Federal Pell Grant for a payment period,  an academic term, for a student in a program using terms and credit hours, other than those described in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, is calculated by—

      (1) Determining his or her enrollment status for the term;

      (i) [Reserved]

      (ii) For a student enrolled in a term other than a semester, trimester, or quarter, determining his or her enrollment status for the term by—

      (A) Dividing the number of weeks of instructional time in the term by the number of weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year;

      (B) Multiplying the fraction determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section by the number of credit hours in the program's academic year to determine the number of hours required to be enrolled to be considered a full-time student; and

      (C) Determining a student's enrollment status by comparing the number of hours in which the student enrolls in the term to the number of hours required to be considered full-time under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for that term;

      (2) Based upon that enrollment status, determining his or her annual award from the Payment Schedule for full-time students or the Disbursement Schedule for three-quarter-time, half-time, or less-than-half-time student; and

      (3) Multiplying his or her annual award determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the following fraction:

      (e)  The Federal Pell Grant for a payment period for a student in a program using credit hours without terms or using clock hours is calculated by—

      (1) Determining the student's Scheduled Federal Pell Grant using the Payment Schedule; and

      (i)

      (ii)

      (f)  A single disbursement may not exceed 50 percent of any award determined under paragraphs (d) and (g)(2) of this section. If a payment for a payment period calculated under paragraphs (d) and (g)(2) of this section would require the disbursement of more than 50 percent of a student's annual award in that payment period, the institution must make at least two disbursements to the student in that payment period. The institution may not disburse an amount that exceeds 50 percent of the student's annual award until the student has completed the period of time in the payment period that equals, in terms of weeks of instructional time, 50 percent of the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year.

      (g)  (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section and § 690.66, the amount of a student's award for an award year may not exceed one and one-half of his or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant award for that award year.

      (2) A student's payment for the payment period may include the remaining amount of the student's Scheduled Award plus an amount from the additional Federal Pell Grant funds not to exceed one-half of a student's Scheduled Award.

      (3) For purposes of this section and § 690.66, an institution must define an academic year for each of its eligible programs in terms of the number of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.3.

#### § § 690.64

      (a) If a student enrolls in a payment period that is scheduled to occur in two award years—

      (1) The entire payment period must be considered to occur within one award year;

      (2) The institution must determine for each Federal Pell Grant recipient the award year in which the payment period will be placed;

      (3) If an institution places the payment period in the first award year, it must pay a student with funds from the first award year; and

      (4) If an institution places the payment period in the second award year, it must pay a student with funds from the second award year.

      (b) An institution may not make a payment which will result in the student receiving more than one and one-half of his or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant for an award year.

#### § § 690.65

      (a) If a student who receives a Federal Pell Grant at one institution subsequently enrolls at a second institution in the same award year, the student may receive a Federal Pell Grant at the second institution only if—

      (1) The student submits a valid SAR to the second institution; or

      (2) The second institution obtains a valid ISIR.

      (b) The second institution shall calculate the student's award according to § 690.63.

      (c) The second institution may pay a Federal Pell Grant only for that portion of the academic year in which a student is enrolled at that institution. The grant amount must be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the grant does not exceed one and one-half of the student's Scheduled Federal Pell Grant for that award year.

      (d) If a student's Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second institution differs from the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first institution, the grant amount at the second institution is calculated as follows—

      (1) The amount received at the first institution is compared to the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first institution to determine the percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant that the student has received.

      (2) That percentage is subtracted from 100 percent or 150 percent, if the student is eligible to receive additional Federal Pell Grant funds in an amount up to one-half of a Scheduled Award during a single award year.

      (3) The remaining percentage is the percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second institution to which the student is entitled.

      (e) The student's Federal Pell Grant for each payment period is calculated according to the procedures in § 690.63 unless the remaining percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second institution, referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is less than the amount the student would normally receive for that payment period. In that case, the student's Federal Pell Grant is equal to that remaining percentage.

      (f) A transfer student shall repay any amount received in an award year that exceeds his or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant, or one and one-half of his or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant, whichever is applicable.

      (2) The institution shall make the second payment to a student for an academic year, as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, after the student submits 75 percent of the lessons or otherwise completes 75 percent of the work scheduled for the program or the academic year, whichever occurs last.

      (c) In a program of correspondence study offered by correspondence courses using terms but not including any residential component—

      (1) The institution must prepare a written schedule for submission of lessons that reflects a workload of at least 30 hours of preparation per semester hour or 20 hours of preparation per quarter hour during the term;

      (2)(i) If the student is enrolled in at least 6 credit hours that commence and are completed in that term, the Disbursement Schedule for a half-time student is used to calculate the payment for the payment period; or

      (ii) If the student is enrolled in less than 6 credit hours that commence and are completed in that term the Disbursement Schedule for a less-than-half-time student is used to calculate the payment for the payment period;

      (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if an institution makes a Federal Pell Grant overpayment for which it is not liable, it must promptly send a written notice to the student requesting repayment of the overpayment amount. The notice must state that failure to make that repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the Federal Pell Grant overpayment.

      (2) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Pell Grant overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, the institution must consider any information provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the student fails to repay a Federal Pell Grant overpayment or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the Federal Pell Grant overpayment, after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (b) of this section, the institution must refer the overpayment to the Secretary for collection purposes in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the Federal Pell Grant overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further efforts to recover the overpayment.

      (i) Within the same award year—if possible—to correct any overpayment or underpayment; or

      (ii) During the next award year to correct any overpayment that could not be adjusted during the year in which the student was overpaid.

      (b)  (1) If the student's enrollment status changes from one academic term to another term within the same award year, the institution shall recalculate the Federal Pell Grant award for the new payment period taking into account any changes in the cost of attendance.

      (2)(i) If the student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. Any such recalculations must take into account any changes in the cost of attendance. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students.

      (ii) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution shall recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which the student actually began attendance.

      (c)  If the student's cost of attendance changes at any time during the award year and his or her enrollment status remains the same, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students.

      What Is the Amount of Assistance and How May It Be Used?

        § 692.10   How does the Secretary allot funds to the States?

#### § § 692.10

        (a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the LEAP program an amount which bears the same ratio to the Federal LEAP funds appropriated as the number of students in that State who are “deemed eligible” to participate in the State's LEAP program bears to the total number of students in all States who are “deemed eligible” to participate in the LEAP program, except that no State may receive less than it received in fiscal year 1979 for the programs under this part.

        (2) For the programs under this part, if the Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year are not sufficient to allot to each State the amount of Federal funds it received in fiscal year 1979, the Secretary allots to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal funds appropriated as the amount of Federal funds that State received in fiscal year 1979 bears to the amount of Federal funds all States received in fiscal year 1979.

        (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary determines the number of students “deemed eligible” to participate in a State's LEAP Program by dividing the amount of that State's LEAP expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the “average grant award per student” by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of LEAP expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotments and the State funds matching those allotments. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most current available data reported by each State.

#### § § 692.110

        (a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the GAP Program an amount of the funds available for the GAP Program based on the ratio used to allot the State's Federal LEAP funds under § 692.10(a).

        (2) If a State meets the requirements of § 692.113(b) for a fiscal year, the number of students under § 692.10(a) for the State is increased to 125 percent in determining the ratio in paragraph (a) of this section for that fiscal year.

        (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section—

        (i) If the Federal GAP funds available from the appropriation for a fiscal year are sufficient to allot to each State that participated in the prior year the same amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year, but are not sufficient both to allot the same amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year to these States and also to allot additional funds to additional States in accordance with the ratio used to allot the States' Federal LEAP funds under § 692.10(a), the Secretary allots—

        (A) To each State that participated in the prior year, the amount the State received in the prior year; and

        (B) To each State that did not participate in the prior year, an amount of Federal GAP funds available to States based on the ratio used to allot the State's Federal LEAP funds under § 692.10(a); and

        (ii) If the Federal GAP funds available from the appropriation for a fiscal year are not sufficient to allot to each State that participated in the prior year at least the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year, the Secretary allots to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal GAP funds available as the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted to each State in the prior fiscal year bears to the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted to all States in the prior fiscal year.

        (4) For fiscal year 2011, the prior fiscal year allotment to a State for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall include any fiscal year 2010 allotment made to that State under subpart B of this part.

        (b) The Secretary allots funds available for reallotment in a fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section used to calculate initial allotments for the fiscal year.

        (c) Any funds made available for the program under this subpart but not expended may be allotted or reallotted for the program under subpart A of this part.

        (b)  (1) The amount of a LEAP Grant under GAP by a State to an eligible student shall be not less than—

        (i) The average undergraduate in-State tuition and mandatory fees for full-time students at the public institutions of higher education in the State where the student resides that are the same type of institution that the student attends (four-year degree-granting, two-year degree-granting, or non-degree-granting); minus

        (ii) Other Federal and State aid the student receives.

        (2) The Secretary determines the average undergraduate in-State tuition and mandatory fees for full-time students at public institutions in a State weighted by enrollment using the most recent data reported by institutions in the State to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) administered by the National Center for Educational Statistics.

        (c)  (1) A State receiving an allotment under this subpart may restrict the use of LEAP Grants under GAP only to students attending institutions of higher education that are participating in the partnership.

        (2) If a State provides LEAP Grants under subpart A of this part to students attending institutions of higher education located in another State, LEAP Grants under GAP may be used at institutions of higher education located in another State.

        (d)  (1) Each State receiving an allotment under this subpart shall annually notify potentially eligible students in grades 7 through 12 in the State, and their families, of their potential eligibility for student financial assistance, including a LEAP Grant under GAP, to attend a LEAP-participating institution of higher education.

        (2) The notice shall include—

        (A) Meet the eligibility requirements under § 692.120; and

        (B) Enroll at a LEAP-participating institution of higher education in the State of the student's residence or an out-of-state institution if the State elects to make LEAP Grants under GAP for attendance at out-of-State institutions in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

        (vi) Any additional requirements that the State may require for receipt of a LEAP Grant under GAP in accordance with § 692.120(a)(4); and

        (vii) An explanation that a student is required to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid to determine his or her eligibility for Federal and State financial assistance and may include a provision that eligibility for an award is subject to change based on—

        (A) A determination of the student's financial eligibility at the time of the student's enrollment at a LEAP-participating institution of higher education or an out-of-State institution in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

        (B) Annual Federal and State spending for higher education; and

        (C) Other aid received by the student at the time of the student's enrollment at the institution of higher education.

        (e)  (1) Once a student, including a student who has received early notification under paragraph (d) of this section, applies for admission to an institution that is a partner in the partnership of the State of the student's residence, files a Free Application for Federal Student Aid and any related State form, and is determined eligible by the State, the State shall—

        (i) Issue the student a preliminary award certificate for a LEAP Grant under GAP with estimated award amounts; and

        (ii) Inform the student that the payment of the grant is subject to certification of enrollment and eligibility by the institution.

        (2) If a student enrolls in an institution that is not a partner in the partnership of the student's State of residence but the State has not restricted eligibility to students enrolling in partner institutions, including, if applicable, out-of-State institutions, the State shall, to the extent practicable, follow the procedures of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

    § 694.8   Under what conditions may the Secretary approve a request from a Partnership applying for a GEAR UP grant to waive a portion of the matching requirement?

#### § § 694.8

    (a) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request for a waiver of up to 75 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the applicant demonstrates in its application a significant economic hardship that stems from a specific, exceptional, or uncontrollable event, such as a natural disaster, that has a devastating effect on the members of the Partnership and the community in which the project would operate.

    (b)(1) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request to waive up to 50 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the applicant demonstrates in its application a pre-existing and an on-going significant economic hardship that precludes the applicant from meeting its matching requirement.

    (2) In determining whether an applicant is experiencing an on-going economic hardship that is significant enough to justify a waiver under this paragraph, the Secretary considers documentation of such factors as:

    (i) Severe distress in the local economy of the community to be served by the grant ( there are few employers in the local area, large employers have left the local area, or significant reductions in employment in the local area).

    (ii) Local unemployment rates that are higher than the national average.

    (iii) Low or decreasing revenues for State and County governments in the area to be served by the grant.

    (iv) Significant reductions in the budgets of institutions of higher education that are participating in the grant.

    (v) Other data that reflect a significant economic hardship for the geographical area served by the applicant.

    (3) At the time of application, the Secretary may provide tentative approval of an applicant's request for a waiver under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for all remaining years of the project period. Grantees that receive tentative approval of a waiver for more than two years under this paragraph must submit to the Secretary every two years by such time as the Secretary may direct documentation that demonstrates that—

    (i) The significant economic hardship upon which the waiver was granted still exists; and

    (ii) The grantee tried diligently, but unsuccessfully, to obtain contributions needed to meet the matching requirement.

    (c) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request in its application to match its contributions to its scholarship fund, established under section 404E of the HEA, on the basis of two non-Federal dollars for every one Federal dollar of GEAR UP funds.

    (d) The Secretary may approve a request by a Partnership applicant that has three or fewer institutions of higher education as members to waive up to 70 percent of the matching requirement if the Partnership applicant includes—

    (1) A fiscal agent that is eligible to receive funds under title V, or Part B of title III, or section 316 or 317 of the HEA, or a local educational agency;

    (2) Only participating schools with a 7th grade cohort in which at least 75 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act; and

    (3) Only local educational agencies in which at least 50 percent of the students enrolled are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

    § 694.9   Under what conditions may the Secretary approve a request from a Partnership that has received a GEAR UP grant to waive a portion of the matching requirement?

#### § § 694.9

    (a) After a grant is awarded, the Secretary may approve a Partnership grantee's written request for a waiver of up to—

    (1) 50 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the grantee demonstrates that—

    (i) The matching contributions described for those two years in the grantee's approved application are no longer available; and

    (ii) The grantee has exhausted all funds and sources of potential contributions for replacing the matching funds.

    (2) 75 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the grantee demonstrates that matching contributions from the original application are no longer available due to an uncontrollable event, such as a natural disaster, that has a devastating economic effect on members of the Partnership and the community in which the project would operate.

    (b) In determining whether the grantee has exhausted all funds and sources of potential contributions for replacing matching funds, the Secretary considers the grantee's documentation of key factors such as the following and their direct impact on the grantee:

    (1) A reduction of revenues from State government, County government, or the local educational agency (LEA).

    (2) An increase in local unemployment rates.

    (3) Significant reductions in the operating budgets of institutions of higher education that are participating in the grant.

    (4) A reduction of business activity in the local area ( large employers have left the local area).

    (5) Other data that reflect a significant decrease in resources available to the grantee in the local geographical area served by the grantee.

    (c) If a grantee has received one or more waivers under this section or under § 694.8, the grantee may request an additional waiver of the matching requirement under this section no earlier than 60 days before the expiration of the grantee's existing waiver.

    (d) The Secretary may grant an additional waiver request for up to 50 percent of the matching requirement for a period of up to two years beyond the expiration of any previous waiver.
