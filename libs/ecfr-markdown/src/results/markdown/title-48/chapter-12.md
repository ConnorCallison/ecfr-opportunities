        1201.101   Purpose.

#### § 1201.101

        The Department of Transportation (DOT), Transportation Acquisition Regulation (TAR), establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The TAR provides regulatory or policy instruction when coverage is needed for DOT-specific subject matter not covered in the FAR. The TAR also includes policy statements that DOT considers important to both internal and external TAR audiences. The Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM) contains internal operating procedures, providing supplementary guidance and instructions for carrying out FAR and TAR requirements.

        1201.102-70   DOT statement of guiding principles for the Department of Transportation Acquisition System.

#### § 1201.102-70

        (a)  The TAR applies to all Department acquisitions unless otherwise excluded by statute. DOT strives to make its acquisition process effective, efficient, and transparent, and to ensure that the process embodies fairness and Governmentwide best practices.

        (b)  The TAR is a key component of DOT's acquisition process and is designed to provide clear and current regulatory and policy oversight to supplement or support implementation of the FAR.

        (c)  The Office of the Senior Procurement Executive (OSPE) applies leadership and best-in-industry acquisition practices to establish acquisition policies and procedures. The OSPE supports the DOT's mission by providing timely, effective, and ethical business policies, practices, products, innovative programs, strategies, and services.

        1201.104   Applicability.

#### § 1201.104

        (a) Applicable statutes, the FAR, 48 CFR chapter 1, and the TAR, in this chapter, apply to all acquisitions within the Department unless otherwise specifically excluded by statute, the FAR, or the TAR.

        (b) The following order of precedence applies to resolve any question of applicability concerning an acquisition regulation or a procedure found within the TAR, or the TAM which comprises the Department's internal operating procedures and guidance—

        (1) U.S. Statutes;

        (2) The FAR;

        (3) The TAR;

        (4) DOT Orders; and

        (5) The TAM.

        (c) The Maritime Administration may depart from the requirements of the FAR and TAR as authorized by 40 U.S.C. 113(e)(15), but shall adhere to those regulations to the maximum extent practicable. Deviations from the FAR or TAR requirements shall be documented according to Maritime Administration procedures or in each contract file, as appropriate.

        (d) The FAR, TAR, and TAM do not apply to the Federal Aviation Administration as provided by 49 U.S.C. 40110(d).

        (e) For purposes of the FAR, TAR, and TAM, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology shall have the same authority as an Operating Administration as defined in 1202.1, and the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology shall have the same authority as a Head of the Operating Administration as defined in 1202.1.

        1201.105   Issuance.

#### § 1201.105

        1201.105-1   Publication and code arrangement.

#### § 1201.105-1

        (a) The TAR is published or available in—

        (1) The ;

        (2) Cumulative form in the CFR; and

        (3) Online via the internet at

        (b) The TAR is issued as this chapter.

        1201.105-2   Arrangement of regulations.

#### § 1201.105-2

        (a)  The TAR, which encompasses both Department and Operating Administration (OA)/Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R)-specific guidance ( subpart 1201.3), conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104. Guidance that is OA-specific contains the OA's acronym directly after the heading.

        (b) —(1)  (i) The numbering illustrations at FAR 1.105-2(b) apply to the TAR.

        (ii) Coverage within the TAR is identified by the prefix “12” followed by the complete TAR citation. For example, 1201.201-1(b).

        (iii) Coverage in the TAR that supplements the FAR will use part, subpart, section, and subsection numbers ending in “70” through “89” ( 1201.301-70). A series of numbers beginning with “70” is used for provisions and clauses.

        (iv) Coverage in the TAR, other than that identified with a “70” or higher number, that implements the FAR uses the identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being implemented, which may be to the paragraph level. Paragraph numbers and letters are not always shown sequentially, but may be shown by the specific FAR paragraph implemented. For example, TAR 1201.201-1 contains only paragraph (b) because only this paragraph, correlated with the FAR, is implemented in the TAR.

        (2)  Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR or TAR shall be identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of “90” and higher.

        (c)  The Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation may be referred to as the TAR. Cross reference to the FAR in the TAR will be cited by “FAR” followed by the FAR numbered citation, and cross reference to the TAM in the TAR will be cited by “TAM” followed by the TAM numbered citations. References to specific citations within the TAR will be referenced by the numbered citation only,  1201.105-3.

        (3) Using the TAR coverage at 1201.105-2(b) as a typical illustration, reference to the—

        (i) Part would be “TAR part 1201” outside the TAR and “part 1201” within the TAR.

        (ii) Subpart would be “TAR subpart 1201.1” outside the TAR and “subpart 1201.1” within the TAR.

        (iii) Section would be “TAR 1201.105” outside the TAR and “1201.105” within the TAR.

        (iv) Subsection would be “TAR 1201.105-2” outside the TAR and “1201.105-2” within the TAR.

        (v) Paragraph would be “TAR 1201.105-2(b)” outside the TAR and “1201.105-2(b)” within the TAR.

        1201.105-3   Copies.

The contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) are provided an opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c)  DOT shall send the notice of proposed debarment to the last known address of the individual or contractor, the individual or contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other means that allows for confirmation of delivery to include by mail, to the last known street address, to the last known facsimile numbers, or to the last known email address. In the case of a contractor, DOT may send the notice of proposed debarment to the contractor, any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture; to the contractor's identified counsel for purposes of administrative proceedings; or to the contractor's agent for the service of process.

        (i) The SDO, upon the request of the contractor proposed for debarment, shall, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the SDO to present information or argument, in person or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. This information submitted by a contractor proposed for debarment is known as a Presentation of Matters in Opposition as set forth in DOT Order 4200.5G. DOT shall conduct the proceeding in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The SDO may use flexible procedures to allow a contractor to present matters in opposition via telephone or internet. If so, the debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c) of this section to include those flexible procedures.

        (ii) If the SDO finds the contractor's or individual's submission in opposition to the proposed debarment raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment and the debarment action is not based on a conviction or civil judgment, the SDC shall submit to the SDO the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the SDO agrees there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the SDO shall conduct a fact-finding proceeding or shall refer the dispute to a designee for resolution pursuant to 1209.470. The SDC shall provide the contractor or individual the disputed material fact(s).

        (iii) If the proposed debarment action is based on a conviction or civil judgment, or if there are no disputes over material facts, or if any disputes over material facts have been resolved pursuant to 1209.470, the SDO shall make a decision on the basis of all information available including any written findings of fact submitted by the designated fact finder, and oral or written arguments presented or submitted to the SDC by the contractor.

        (e)  In actions processed under FAR 9.406 where no suspension is in place and where a fact-finding proceeding is not required, DOT shall make the final decision on the proposed debarment within 30 business days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the contractor by the means of delivery set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, unless the SDO extends this period for good cause.

However, in accordance with FAR 23.506(e), only the Secretary of Transportation may waive the suspension of contract payments, termination of a contract for default, or suspension of a contractor for actions under FAR subpart 23.5 and FAR 23.506.

        1209.407-3   Procedures.

#### § 1209.407-3

        Contracting officers and contracting activities shall comply with DOT Order 4200.5G, Suspension and Debarment, and Ineligibility Policies, and this subpart to include the following procedures—

        (a)  Any individual may submit a referral to suspend an individual or contractor to the SDC or SDO (the debarring official) ( 1209.403). The SDC shall promptly report, in writing, a proposed suspension action directly to the SDO. Upon review by the SDO, if the matter involves possible criminal or fraudulent activities, the SDO shall also refer the matter to the DOT OIG to ensure coordination of appropriate activity.

        (b)  When the SDC finds adequate evidence of a cause for suspension, as listed in FAR 9.407-2, the SDC shall prepare a recommendation and draft notice of suspension for the SDO's consideration. After receipt of the report from the SDC, the SDO may request from interested parties, including the contractor if deemed appropriate, a meeting or additional supporting information to assist in the suspension decision. The SDC creates a case in the DOT Suspension and Debarment Tracking System as set forth in DOT Order 4200.5G. The contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) are provided an opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c)  DOT shall send the notice of suspension to the last known address of the individual or contractor, the individual or contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other means that allows for confirmation of delivery to include by mail, to the last known street address, to the last known facsimile numbers, or to the last known email address. In the case of a contractor, DOT may send the notice of suspension to the contractor, any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture; to the contractor's identified counsel for purposes of administrative proceedings; or to the contractor's agent for the service of process. If sent by email, it shall be sent to the last known email addresses for all three, if known. Additionally, for each specifically named affiliate, the notice shall be sent to the affiliate itself, the affiliate's identified counsel for purposes of the administrative proceedings, or the affiliate's agency for service of process. If sent by email, it shall be sent to the last known email addresses for all three, if known. The SDO shall also ensure that the appropriate parties are listed as excluded in SAM in accordance with FAR 9.404. After reviewing the SDC's report, and any additional information received in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the SDO shall prepare and coordinate with legal counsel a written notice of suspension.

        (5) The SDO, upon the request of the contractor suspended, shall, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the SDO to present information or argument, in person or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. DOT shall conduct the proceeding in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript.

        (6)(i) If the SDC finds the contractor's or individual's submission in opposition to the suspension raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, or for the purposes of FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), in actions not based on an indictment, the SDC shall submit to the SDO the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the SDO agrees there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the SDO shall conduct a fact-finding proceeding or refer the dispute to a designee for resolution pursuant to 1209.470. The SDC shall provide the contractor or individual the information that established the dispute of material fact(s) in advance of the fact-finding proceeding, in the event the contractor would like to add to the facts prior to the decision of the SDO.

        (ii) If the suspension is based on a conviction or civil judgment, or if there are no disputes over material facts, or if any disputes over material facts have been resolved pursuant to 1209.470, the SDO shall make a decision on the basis of all information available including any written findings of fact submitted by the designated fact finder, and oral or written arguments presented or submitted by the contractor. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript.

        (d)  The SDO shall notify the contractor of the decision whether to impose a suspension. The SDO shall then forward the original signed decision to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file. The SDO reviews submittals and case documents, and acts in accordance with DOT Order 4200.5G and the General DOT Guidelines for Suspension and Debarment, paragraph 12c. The SDO may use flexible procedures to allow a contractor to present matters in opposition via telephone of internet. If so, the debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c) of this section to include those flexible procedures.

        1209.470   Fact-finding procedures.

#### § 1209.470

        The provisions of this section constitute the procedures to be used to resolve genuine disputes of material fact pursuant to 1209.406-3 and 1209.407-3. The SDC shall establish the date for the fact-finding hearing, normally to be held within 30 business days after notifying the contractor or individual that the SDO has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists.

        (a) The Government's representative and the contractor shall each have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the genuine dispute(s) of material fact identified by the SDO. The contractor or individual may appear in person or through counsel at the fact-finding hearing and should address all defenses, contested facts, admissions, remedial actions taken, and, if a proposal to debar is involved, mitigating and aggravating factors. The contractor or individual may submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the agency presents.

        (b) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceedings and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination. The fact-finding proceeding is an informal evidentiary hearing, during which the Rules of Evidence and Civil Procedure do not apply. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.

        (c) The proceedings shall be transcribed and a copy of the transcript shall be made available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the contractor and the factfinder, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.

        (d) The fact-finder shall prepare a written finding(s) of fact for the record by a preponderance of the evidence for proposed debarments, and by adequate evidence for suspensions. A copy of the findings of fact shall be provided to the SDO, the Government's representative, and the contractor or individual. The SDO will consider the written findings of fact in the decision regarding the suspension or proposed debarment.

      Subpart 1213.70—Department of Transportation Procedures for Acquiring Training Services

        1213.7000   Applicability.

#### § 1213.7000

        (a) DOT policy at 1237.7000 applies to Standard Form (SF) 182, Request, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training, which may be used to acquire training services; however, the policy does not apply to training services acquired by Governmentwide commercial purchase card. The Governmentwide commercial purchase card may only be used to acquire training services valued at the micro-purchase threshold level or less.

        (b) As reflected in 1237.7002, this policy does not apply to training attended by DOT employees that is scheduled and conducted by Government sources of supply, educational institutions, or private entities where DOT does not control or sponsor the training. Examples of when the policy does and does not apply include:

        (1) When SF 182s are issued for three DOT employees to attend a one-week course at a university or other private entity, the policy does not apply. DOT does not control the course because the university or private entity has a contract in place with the training provider and DOT is placing an order under an existing contract; and

        (2) When DOT awards a contract to a university or other private entity to provide training for DOT and/or other Government personnel, the policy applies. DOT controls this course; therefore, no soliciting or advertising of private non-Government training while conducting the contracted-for training is permitted.

        1213.7001   Solicitation provision and contract clause.

#### § 1213.7001

        (a) Contracting officers shall insert the provision as prescribed at 1252.237-71, Certification of Data, in all solicitations and requests for quotations, and the clause as prescribed at 1252.237-72, Prohibition on Advertising, in solicitations, requests for quotations, and all contracts ( purchase orders, SF 182s) for training services when the content and/or presentation of the training is controlled by DOT.

        (b) Contracting officers shall incorporate the successful offeror's certified data into any resultant contract(s). Certified data may be adopted by reference, if the contracting officer determines it contains information sufficient to reliably describe the certified data submitted. For example, this type of information includes dated material such as resumes and company or personnel qualifications.

#### § 1228.306

        1228.306-70   Contracts for lease of aircraft.

#### § 1228.306-70

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clauses at 1252.228-70, Loss of or Damage to Leased Aircraft; 1252.228-71, Fair Market Value of Aircraft; and 1252.228-72, Risk and Indemnities, unless otherwise indicated by the specific instructions for their use, in any contract for the lease of aircraft (including aircraft used in out-service flight training), except in the following circumstances—

        (1) When the hourly rental rate does not exceed $250 and the total rental cost for any single transaction is not in excess of $2,500;

        (2) When the cost of hull insurance does not exceed 10 percent of the contract rate; or

        (3) When the lessor's insurer does not grant a credit for uninsured hours, thereby preventing the lessor from granting the same to the Government.

        (b) As codified, 49 U.S.C. 44112, as amended, provides that an aircraft lessor under a lease of 30 days or more is not liable for injury or death of persons, or damage or loss of property, unless the aircraft is in the actual possession or control of the lessor and the damage occurs because of—

        (1) The aircraft, engine, or propeller; or

        (2) The flight of, or an object falling from, the aircraft, engine, or propeller.

        (c) On short-term or intermittent-use leases, however, the owner may be liable for damage caused by operation of the aircraft. It is usual for the aircraft owner to retain insurance covering this liability during the term of such lease. Such insurance can, often for little or no increase in premium, be made to cover the Government's exposure to liability as well. To take advantage of this coverage, the Risks and Indemnities clause at 1252.228-72, prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be used.

        (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1252.228-72, Risk and Indemnities, in any contract for out-service flight training or for the lease of aircraft when the Government will have exclusive use of the aircraft for a period of less than thirty days.

At no time shall Government personnel or other personnel be permitted to take command of the aircraft. The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1252.228-73, Command of Aircraft, in any solicitation and contract for out-service flight training, whether performed utilizing DOT-leased aircraft, contractor-provided aircraft, or Government-provided aircraft.

      Subpart 1232.7—Contract Funding

        1232.770   Incremental funding during a Continuing Resolution.

#### § 1232.770

        1232.770-1   Scope of section.

#### § 1232.770-1

        This section provides policy and procedures for using incremental funding for fixed-price, time-and-material and labor-hour contracts during a period in which funds are provided to the DOT and its operating administrations under a continuing resolution. Heads of the contracting activities may develop necessary supplemental internal procedures and guidance to advise offerors and contractors of these policies and procedures.

        1232.770-2   Definition.

#### § 1232.770-2

        means an appropriation, in the form of a joint resolution, that provides budget authority for Federal agencies, specific activities, or both to continue operation until the regular appropriations are enacted. Typically, a continuing resolution is used when legislative action on appropriations is not completed by the beginning of a fiscal year.

        1232.770-3   General.

#### § 1232.770-3

        The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341, and FAR 32.702, state that no officer or employee of the Government may create or authorize an obligation in excess of the funds available, or in advance of appropriations unless otherwise authorized by law. A CR provides funding for continuing projects or activities that were conducted in the prior fiscal year for which appropriations, funds, or other authority was previously made available. Each CR is governed by the specific terms in that specific CR ( duration of the CR) and under certain CRs, the funding amounts available for award of some contract actions are inadequate to fund the entire amounts needed.

        1232.770-4   Policy.

#### § 1232.770-4

        (a) A fixed-price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour contract or order for commercial or non-commercial severable services may be incrementally funded when—

        (1) Funds are provided to DOT or operating administration under a CR. This includes funds appropriated to DOT or an operating administration, funds appropriated to another entity that will be directly obligated on a DOT contract, and funds in a revolving fund or similar account that will be reimbursed by a customer agency funded by a CR;

        (2) The responsible fiscal authority has not allocated sufficient funds to fully fund the contract action that is otherwise authorized to be issued;

        (3) There is no statutory restriction that would preclude the proposed use of funds;

        (4) Funds are available and unexpired, as of the date the funds are obligated;

        (5) Assurance is provided by the responsible financial authority that full funding is anticipated once an appropriations act is enacted; and

        (6) The clause prescribed by 1232.770-7 is incorporated into the contract or order.

        (b) Incremental funding may be limited to an individual line item(s) or a particular order(s).

        1232.770-5   Limitations.

#### § 1232.770-5

        This policy does not apply to contract actions using funds that are not covered by the CR.

        1232.770-6   Procedures.

#### § 1232.770-6

        (a) An incrementally funded fixed-price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour contract shall be fully funded once funds are available.

        (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that sufficient funds are allotted to the contract to cover the total amount payable to the contractor in the event of termination for convenience by the Government.

        (c) Upon receipt of the contractor's notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1252.232-71, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly provide written notice to the contractor that the Government is—

        (1) Obligating additional funds for continued performance and increasing the Government's limitation of obligation in a specified amount;

        (2) Obligating the full amount of funds needed;

        (3) Terminating for convenience, as applicable, the affected line items or contract; or

        (4) Considering whether to allot additional funds; and

        (i) The contractor is entitled by the contract terms to stop work when the Government's limitation of obligation is reached; and

        (ii) Any costs expended beyond the Government's limitation of obligation are at the contractor's risk.

        (d) Upon learning that the contract will receive no further funds by the date provided in the notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1252.232-71, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly give the contractor written notice of the Government's decision and terminate the affected line items or contract, as applicable, for the convenience of the Government.

        1232.770-7   Clause.

#### § 1232.770-7

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1252.232-71, Limitation of Government's Obligation, in—

        (1) Solicitations and contracts for severable services when incremental funding of a fixed-price, time-and-material, or labor-hour contract due to a CR is anticipated; or

        (2) Contracts or orders for severable services when incremental funding of a fixed-price, time-and-material, or labor-hour contract is authorized and DOT or its operating administrations are operating under a CR ( 1232.770-4).

        (b) The contracting officer shall insert the information required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of clause 1252.232-71.

#### § 1232.905-70

        (a) Under fixed-price contracts, the contracting officer shall require the contractor to submit an invoice or voucher on any form or format meeting FAR 32.905(b) requirements.

If the contract allows for billing fringe benefits as a direct expense, show the actual fringe benefit costs.

        (4)  Show those items normally treated as direct costs. Expendable items need not be itemized and may be grouped into major classifications such as office supplies. However, items valued at $5,000 or more must be itemized.  FAR part 45, Government Property, for reporting of property.

        (5)  List the name and title of traveler, place of travel, and travel dates. If the travel claim is based on the actual costs expended, show the amount for the mode of travel ( airline, private auto, taxi, etc.), lodging, meals, and other incidental expenses separately, on a daily basis. These actual costs must be supported with receipts to substantiate the costs paid. Travel costs for consultants must be shown separately and also supported.

        (6)  Itemize those costs that cannot be placed in categories (1) through (5) above. Categorize these costs to the extent possible.

        (7)  Cite the sum of categories (1) through (6) above.

        1239.7202   Policy.

#### § 1239.7202

        (a)  Generally, DOT entities shall acquire cloud computing services using commercial terms and conditions that are consistent with Federal law and the agency's needs, including those requirements specified in this subpart. Some examples of commercial terms and conditions are license agreements, End User License Agreements (EULAs), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Contracting officers shall carefully review commercial terms and conditions and consult counsel to ensure these are consistent with Federal law, regulations, and the agency's needs. Contracting officers shall incorporate any applicable service provider terms and conditions into the contract by attachment or other appropriate mechanism.

        (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the contracting officer shall only award a contract to acquire cloud computing services from a cloud service provider ( contractor or subcontractor, regardless of tier) that has been granted provisional authorization by the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and meets the security requirements set out by the DOT Chief Information Officer (CIO), at the level appropriate to the requirement to provide the relevant cloud computing services.

        (1) The contracting officer may award a contract to acquire cloud computing services from a cloud service provider that has not been granted provisional authorization when—

        (i) The requirement for a provisional authorization is waived by the DOT CIO; or

        (ii) The cloud computing service requirement is for a private, on-premises version that will be provided from Government facilities. Under this circumstance, the cloud service provider must obtain a provisional authorization prior to operational use.

        (2) When contracting for cloud computing services, the contracting officer shall ensure the following information is provided by the requiring activity:

        (i) Government data and Government-related data descriptions.

        (ii) Data ownership, licensing, delivery, and disposition instructions specific to the relevant types of Government data and Government-related data ( Contract Data Requirements List; work statement task; line items). Disposition instructions shall provide for the transition of data in commercially available, or open and non-proprietary format (and for permanent records, in accordance with disposition guidance issued by National Archives and Record Administration).

        (iii) Appropriate requirements to support applicable inspection, audit, investigation, or other similar authorized activities specific to the relevant types of Government data and Government-related data, or specific to the type of cloud computing services being acquired.

        (iv) Appropriate requirements to support and cooperate with applicable system-wide search and access capabilities for inspections, audits, investigations.

        (c)  (1) Cloud computing service providers are required to maintain within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or outlying areas of the United States, all Government data that is not physically located on DOT premises, unless otherwise authorized by the DOT CIO.

        (2) The contracting officer shall provide written approval to the contractor when the contractor is permitted to maintain Government data at a location outside the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas of the United States.

        1239.7203   DOT FedRAMP specific requirements.

#### § 1239.7203

        DOT entities shall set forth DOT FedRAMP specific cloud service requirements. DOT cloud service providers shall adhere to specific requirements when providing services to DOT and its operating administrations whenever DOT or other Federal agency information, sensitive information as defined by DOT policy, personally identifiable information, or third-party provided information and data will transit through or reside on the cloud services system and infrastructure and that requires protection according to required National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). In addition to the requirements found elsewhere in the FAR, the following are required—

        (a)  The FedRAMP security control baseline requires cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures (see NIST FIPS 140-2). DOT entities must require FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography be used between DOT and the cloud service provider. The program/project manager or requiring activity shall specify which level (1-4) of FIPS 140-2 validation is required. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(c).

        (b)  Cloud service providers are required to implement FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography for digital signatures. If DOT entities require integration with specific digital signature technologies, contracting officers shall specify what level (1-4) of FIPS 140-2 encryption is required. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(d).

        (c)  DOT entities should consider the length of time Cloud Service Providers (CSP) must retain audit records. DOT implements the FedRAMP requirement for a service provider to retain system audit records on-line for at least ninety calendar days and to further preserve audit records off-line for a period that is in accordance with DOT and NARA requirements. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(e).

        (d)  Cloud Service Providers pursuing a FedRAMP authorization must provide a mechanism for DOT activities and operating administrations ( Government consuming end-users) to use multi-factor authentication. DOT follows National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication (PUB) Number 201-2, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(f).

        (e)  Contracting officers shall require that Cloud Service Providers pursuing a FedRAMP authorization provide multi-factor authentication for the provider's administrators. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(g).

        (f)  Contracting officers shall specify in solicitations and contracts the required FedRAMP parameters for Incident Reporting at the levels stipulated in NIST SP 800-61, as well as the requirement for an Incident Reporting Plan that complies with those requirements. The program office shall include specific incident reporting requirements including who and how to notify the agency. See 1239.7002(b) and the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(h).

        (g)  DOT or other Federal agency information and data require protection. Contracting officers shall set forth specific DOT media transport requirements. See the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(i).

        (h)  When DOT leverages FedRAMP Provisional Authorizations, DOT conducts the required background investigations, but may accept reciprocity from other agencies that have implemented the Cloud Service Provider's systems. DOT's screening procedures, process, and additional screening requirements are set forth at 1252.204-70 and the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(j).

        (i)  Contractors shall provide support personnel who are U.S. persons maintaining a NACI clearance or greater in accordance with OMB memoranda and contract clauses, and who shall undergo required DOT background investigations prior to providing services and performing on the contract. See clause 1252.204-70(b) and the clause prescribed at 1239.7204(j). Reinvestigations are required for cloud services provider personnel as follows—

        (1) Moderate risk law enforcement and high impact public trust level—a reinvestigation is required during the 5th year; and

        (2) There is no reinvestigation for other moderate risk positions or any low risk positions.

        1239.7204   Contract clauses.

#### § 1246.705-70

        The following restrictions are applicable to DOT contracts:

        (a) The contractor shall not be required to honor the warranty on any property furnished by the Government except for—

        (1) Defects in installation; and

        (2) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates a warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property.

        (b) Any warranty obtained shall specifically exclude coverage of damage in time of war (combat damage) or national emergency.

        (c) Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage, or injury to third parties.

        1246.706-70   Warranty terms and conditions—requirements.

#### § 1246.706-70

        (a) When appropriate and cost effective, the contracting officer shall comply with the following requirements when developing the warranty terms and conditions—

        (1) Identify the affected line item(s) and the applicable specification(s);

        (2) Require that the line item's design and manufacture will conform to—

        (i) An identified revision of a top-level drawing; and/or

        (ii) An identified specification or revision thereof;

        (3) Require that the line item conform to the specified Government performance requirements;

        (4) Require that all line items and components delivered under the contract will be free from defects in materials and workmanship;

        (5) State that if the contractor fails to comply with specification or there are defects in material and workmanship, the contractor will bear the cost of all work necessary to achieve the specified performance requirements, including repair and/or replacement of all parts;

        (6) Require the timely replacement/repair of warranted items and specify lead times for replacement/repair where possible;

        (7) Identify the specific paragraphs containing Government performance requirements that the contractor must meet;

        (8) Ensure that any performance requirements identified as goals or objectives beyond specification requirements are excluded from the warranty provision;

        (9) Specify what constitutes the start of the warranty period ( delivery, acceptance, in-service date) and the end of the warranty period ( passing a test or demonstration, or operation without failure for a specified period), and specify circumstances requiring an extension of warranty duration ( extending the warranty period as a result of mass defect correction during warranty period);

        (10) Identify what transportation costs will be paid by the contractor in relation to the warranty coverage;

        (11) In addition to combat damage, identify any conditions which will not be covered by the warranty; and

        (12) Identify any limitation on the total dollar amount of the contractor's warranty exposure, or agreement to share costs after a certain dollar threshold to avoid unnecessary warranty returns.

        (b) In addition to the terms and conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer shall consider the following when a warranty clause is being used for a major system, as defined in FAR 2.101:

        (1) For line items or components that are commercially available, obtaining a warranty as is normally provided by the manufacturer or supplier, in accordance with FAR 46.703(d) and 46.710(b)(2).

        (2) Obtaining a warranty of compliance with the stated requirements for line items or components provided in accordance with either design and manufacturing or performance requirements as specified in the contract or any modification to that contract.

        (3) A warranty provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall provide that in the event the line items or any components thereof fails to meet the terms of the warranty provided, the contracting officer may—

        (i) Require the contractor to promptly take such corrective action as the contracting officer determines to be necessary at no additional cost to the Government, including repairing or replacing all parts necessary to achieve the requirements set forth in the contract;

        (ii) Require the contractor to pay costs reasonably incurred by the United States in taking necessary corrective action; or

        (iii) Equitably reduce the contract price.

        (4) Inserting remedies, exclusions, limitations and durations, provided these are consistent with the specific requirements of this subpart and FAR 46.706.

        (5) Excluding from the terms of the warranty certain defects for specified supplies (exclusions) and limiting the contractor's liability under the terms of the warranty (limitations), as appropriate, if necessary to derive a cost-effective warranty considering the technical risk, contractor financial risk, or other program uncertainties.

        (6) Structuring of a broader and more comprehensive warranty where such is advantageous. Likewise, the contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate ( where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the system).

        (c) Any contract that contains a warranty clause must contain warranty implementation procedures, including warranty notification content and procedures, and identify the individuals responsible for implementation of warranty provisions. The contract may also permit the contractor's participation in investigation of system failures, if the contractor is reimbursed at established rates for fault isolation work, and that the Government receive credit for any payments where equipment failure is covered by warranty provisions.
