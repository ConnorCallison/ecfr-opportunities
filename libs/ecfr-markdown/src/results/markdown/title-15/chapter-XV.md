The Board shall consist of manufacturers and of not fewer than 15 and not more than 25 members appointed by the Secretary, from nominations submitted as set forth in § 1500.41. No employee of an industry trade organization exempt from tax under paragraph (3) or (6) of section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 representing the concrete masonry industry or related industries shall serve as a member of the Board and no member of the Board may serve concurrently as an officer of the board of directors of a national concrete masonry products industry trade association.

        (b) The initial Board and all subsequent Boards, unless modified by the Board as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be subject to the following:

        (1) To ensure fair and equitable representation of the concrete masonry products industry, the composition of the Board shall reflect the geographical distribution of the manufacture of concrete masonry products in the United States, the types of concrete masonry products manufactured, and the range in size of manufacturers in the United States.

        (2) No company or its affiliates shall have more than two members on the Board.

        (c) To the extent possible, dependent on the nominees submitted, the Secretary will strive to appoint at least two members from each region. Similarly, the Secretary will strive to appoint at least one member from each of the following districts:

        (d) Three years after the assessment of concrete masonry units commences pursuant to implementation of this Order, and at the end of each three-year period thereafter, the Board, subject to the review and approval of the Secretary, shall, if warranted, recommend to the Secretary the reapportionment of the Board membership to reflect changes in the geographical distribution of the manufacture of concrete masonry products and the types of concrete masonry products manufactured.

In any case in which the Board fails to submit nominations for any open position, the Secretary shall appoint a member qualifying for the position under the criteria set forth in § 1500.40.

        (c) As terms expire or vacancies occur among members and alternate members, nominations and those interested in being considered for Board membership, including self-nominations, may submit such nominations to the Board. For each expired or vacant position, the Board will evaluate the nominations received, verify the willingness of nominees to serve, and then will submit to the Secretary at least three nominees for each such position. The Secretary may also receive nominations and may forward them to the Board for their consideration. The Secretary is not bound by the recommendations of the Board; in selecting members, the Secretary will consider the recommendations of the Board, individual expertise, distribution of appointments, and more expansive input from sources available to the Secretary.

        (a) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, and during the fiscal year as may be necessary, the Board shall prepare and submit to the Secretary for approval a budget for the fiscal year covering its anticipated expenses and disbursements in administering this Order, including the probable cost of each promotion, research, and education activity proposed to be developed or carried out by the Board and a section that annotates and explains any shortcomings, overruns, and shift of funds from the previous year's budget. Such budget shall be deemed approved if the Secretary fails to approve or reject the budget within 60 days of receipt, unless the Secretary proposes to the Board and to Congress, reasonable justification for the delay and provides a reasonable date by which approval or disapproval will be made. The Department may provide such justification in any written format.

        (b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, each such budget shall include:

        (1) A statement of objectives and strategy for each program, plan, or project, with a comparative for the preceding year—annotating the success and explaining the shortcomings of the preceding year's programs, plans, and projects

If the Secretary fails to approve or reject a budget, or an amendment or addition to an approved budget, within 60 days of receipt, such budget shall be deemed approved, unless the Secretary provides to the Board and to Congress, in writing, reasonable justification for the delay and provides a reasonable date by which approval or disapproval will be made. The Department may provide such justification in any written format.

        (e) The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Board for its maintenance and functioning, and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this Order.

        (1) In each fiscal year, through fiscal year 2030, the Board may not obligate an amount greater than the sum of—

        (i) 73 percent of the amount of assessments estimated to be collected under § 1500.51 in such fiscal year);

        (ii) 73 percent of the amount of assessments actually collected under § 1500.51 in the most recent fiscal year for which an audit report has been submitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amount that may be obligated is being determined, less the estimate made pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section for such most recent fiscal year; and

        (iii) Amounts permitted in preceding fiscal years to be obligated that have not been obligated.

        (iv) For fiscal years 9 and 10 (ending September 2028 and 2029) there is a special rule for estimates. Specifically, the amounts estimated to be collected shall be 62 percent of the amount of assessments actually collected in the most recent fiscal year for which an audit report has been submitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amount be obligated is being determined.

        (2) Assessments collected in excess of the amount permitted to be obligated in a fiscal year shall be deposited in an escrow account until the end of the 11th fiscal year or September 2030.

        (3) Prior to the end of the 11th fiscal year or September 30, 2030, the Board may not obligate, expend, or borrow against amounts deposited in the escrow account. Any interest earned on such amounts shall be deposited in the escrow account and shall be unavailable for obligation until the end of the 11th fiscal year or September 30, 2030.

        (g) With approval of the Secretary, the Board may borrow money for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal, budget and audit controls as other funds of the Board. Any funds borrowed by the Board shall be expended only for startup costs and capital outlays.

Reimbursements to the Secretary required under paragraph (g) of this section are excluded from this limitation on spending.

        (j) Pending disbursement of assessments and all other revenue under a budget approved by the Secretary, the Board may invest assessments and all other revenues collected under this section in:

        (1) Obligations of the United States or any agency of the United States;

        (2) General obligations of any state or any political subdivision of a state;

        (3) Interest bearing accounts or certificates of deposit of financial institutions that are members of the Federal Reserve System; or

        (4) Obligations fully guaranteed as to principal interest by the United States.

        § 1500.51   Assessments.

#### § § 1500.51

        (a) The collection of assessments on concrete masonry units will be the responsibility of the manufacturer who sells the concrete masonry units. There shall be an assessment on the first sale of concrete masonry units only and not on subsequent sales of concrete masonry units already assessed. The manufacturer will be required to collect and remit its individual assessments no less than quarterly. Manufacturers shall identify the total amount due in assessments on all sales receipts, invoices or other commercial documents of sale as a result of the sale of concrete masonry units. Within 180 days of their initial meeting, the Board will provide for review and approval by the Secretary a proposed evaluation and compliance program and its plan to evaluate program effectiveness and to verify compliance with the Act. The evaluation and compliance program will provide the method and metrics that will help determine program effectiveness and will outline the way the Board will receive assessments, how they will verify compliance, determine the best method to track sales, and how to document all actions including the process by which the Board will use to ensure it meets or exceeds the legislatively-mandated disbursement of received assessments.

        (b) Such assessments shall be levied at a rate of $0.01 per concrete masonry unit sold by a manufacturer. The Board may make assessments effective as of the effective date of this Order. Submission of funds may be made to the Board within 60 days of the end of the first quarter after the Board is established; thereafter submission of funds will be to the board within 60 days of the end of each quarter.

        (c) At any time following the conduct of the initial referendum conducted pursuant to this Order, the assessment rate will be reviewed by the Board and, upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of voting members of the Board, may be modified; provided that the assessment rate may be raised to a maximum of $0.05 cents per unit, that only one increase may be implemented in any one-year period, and each individual increase may not exceed $0.01

        (d) Not less than 50 percent of the assessments (less administration expenses) paid by a manufacturer shall be used to support research, education, and promotion programs and projects in support of the Geographic Region of the manufacturer.

        (e) All assessment payments and reports will be submitted to the Board quarterly. All quarterly payments are to be received no later than 60 days after the conclusion of each quarter. A late payment charge shall be imposed on any manufacturer who fails to remit to the Board the total amount for which any such manufacturer is liable on or before the due date established by the Board. In addition to the late payment charge, an interest charge shall be imposed on the outstanding amount for which the manufacturer is liable. The rate of interest and late payment charges shall be specified by the Secretary.

        (f) Manufacturers failing to remit total assessments due in a timely manner may also be subject to actions under Federal debt collection procedures.

        (g) The Board may authorize other organizations to collect assessments on its behalf with the approval of the Secretary.

        (h) The Board shall provide manufacturers submitting assessments under this Order with the opportunity to apply for rebates on assessments remitted to the Board for concrete masonry units not covered by this Order and for assessments remitted to the Board for concrete masonry units sold to a purchaser that subsequently failed to remit payment due to bankruptcy, bad debt or other reasons causing the money intended to be collected from such sale to be uncollectible. Those requesting rebates in such circumstances must provide all necessary documentation as the Board shall determine.

        § 1500.60   Programs and projects.
