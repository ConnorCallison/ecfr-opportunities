          § 550.135   What will BOEM do if my operating performance is unacceptable?

#### § § 550.135

          If your operating performance is unacceptable, BOEM may disapprove or revoke your designation as operator on a single facility or multiple facilities. We will give you adequate notice and opportunity for a review by BOEM officials before imposing a disqualification.

          § 550.136   How will BOEM determine if my performance is unacceptable?

#### § § 550.136

          In determining if your operating performance is unacceptable, BOEM will consider, individually or collectively:

          (b) You must receive the Regional Supervisor's written approval before you can use alternate procedures or equipment.

          (c) To receive approval, you must either submit information or give an oral presentation to the appropriate Regional Supervisor. Your presentation must describe the site-specific application(s), performance characteristics, and safety features of the proposed procedure or equipment.

          § 550.142   How do I receive approval for departures?

#### § § 550.142

          We may approve departures to the operating requirements. You may apply for a departure by writing to the Regional Supervisor.

          § 550.143   How do I designate an operator?

#### § § 550.143

          (a) You must provide the Regional Supervisor an executed Designation of Operator form (Form BOEM-1123) unless you are the only lessee and are the only person conducting lease operations. When there is more than one lessee, each lessee must submit the Designation of Operator form and the Regional Supervisor must approve the designation before the designated operator may begin operations on the leasehold.

          (b) This designation is authority for the designated operator to act on your behalf and to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, and the regulations in this part.

          (c) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide the Regional Supervisor a written notification of any change of address.

          (d) If you change the designated operator on your lease, you must pay the service fee listed in § 550.125 of this subpart with your request for a change in designation of operator. Should there be multiple lessees, all designation of operator forms must be collected by one lessee and submitted to BOEM in a single submittal, which is subject to only one filing fee.

          § 550.144   How do I designate a new operator when a designation of operator terminates?

#### § § 550.144

          (a) When a Designation of Operator terminates, the Regional Supervisor must approve a new designated operator before you may continue operations. Each lessee must submit a new executed Designation of Operator form.

          (b) If your Designation of Operator is terminated, or a controversy develops between you and your designated operator, you and your designated operator must protect the lessor's interests.

          § 550.146   How do I designate an agent or a local agent?

#### § § 550.146

          (a) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval, or the Regional Director may require you to designate an agent empowered to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, or the regulations in this part.

          (b) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval a local agent empowered to receive notices and submit requests, applications, notices, or supplemental information.

#### § § 550.160

          (a) A RUE is required to construct, secure to the seafloor, use, modify, or maintain platforms, seafloor production equipment, artificial islands, facilities, installations, and/or other devices at an OCS site other than an OCS lease you own, that are:

#### § § 550.162

          If your right-of-use and easement is on a lease, you may continue to exercise the right-of-use and easement after the lease on which it is situated terminates. You must only use the right-of-use and easement for the purpose that the grant specifies. All future lessees of that portion of the OCS on which your right-of-use and easement is situated must continue to recognize the right-of-use and easement for the purpose that the grant specifies.

          § 550.163   If I have a State lease, will BOEM grant me a right-of-use and easement?

#### § § 550.163

          (a) BOEM may grant a lessee of a State lease located adjacent to or accessible from the OCS a right-of-use and easement on the OCS.

          (b) BOEM will only grant a right-of-use and easement under this paragraph to enable a State lessee to conduct and maintain a device that is permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed ( a platform, artificial island, or installation). The lessee must use the device to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas from the adjacent or accessible State lease and for other operations related to these activities.

#### § § 550.164

          (a) A right-of-use and easement granted under the heading of “Right-of-use and easement” in this subpart is subject to BOEM regulations, 30 CFR parts 550 through 582, BSEE regulations, 30 CFR parts 250 through 282, and any terms and conditions that the BOEM Regional Director or BSEE Regional Director prescribes.

          (b) For the whole or fraction of the first calendar year, and annually after that, you must pay to BOEM, in advance, an annual rental payment.

          § 550.165   If I have a State lease, what fees do I have to pay for a right-of-use and easement?

#### § § 550.165

          When you apply for a right-of-use and easement, you must pay:

          (a) A nonrefundable filing fee as specified in § 550.125; and

          (b) The first year's rental as specified in § 550.160(g).

          § 550.166   If BOEM grants me a RUE, what financial assurance must I provide?

#### § § 550.166

          (a) Before BOEM grants you a RUE on the OCS, you must submit or maintain financial assurance of $500,000, which will guarantee compliance with the regulations and the terms and conditions of all RUEs you hold.

          (1) You are not required to submit and maintain the financial assurance of $500,000 pursuant to this paragraph (a) if you furnish and maintain area-wide lease financial assurance in excess of $500,000 pursuant to § 556.901(a) of this subchapter, provided that the area-wide lease financial assurance also guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of all RUEs you hold in the area.

          (2) The Regional Director may reduce the amount required in this paragraph (a) upon a determination that the reduced amount is sufficient to guarantee compliance with the regulations and the terms and conditions of all RUE grant(s) you hold.

          (3) The requirements for financial assurance in §§ 556.900(d) through (g) 556.902 of this subchapter apply to the financial assurance required under paragraph (a) of this section.

          (b) If BOEM grants you a RUE that serves either an OCS lease or a State lease, the Regional Director may require supplemental financial assurance above the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section, to ensure compliance with the obligations under your RUE grant, based on an evaluation of your ability to carry out present and future obligations on the RUE using the criteria set forth in § 556.901(d)(1) through (3) of this subchapter. This supplemental financial assurance must:

          (1) Meet the requirements of §§ 556.900(d) through (g) and 556.902 of this subchapter; and

          (2) Cover costs and liabilities for compliance with the obligations of your RUE grants and with applicable BOEM and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) orders.

          (c) If you fail to replace any deficient financial assurance upon demand or fail to provide supplemental financial assurance upon demand, the Regional Director may:

          (1) Assess penalties under subpart N of this part;

          (2) Request BSEE to suspend operations on your RUE; and/or

          (3) Initiate action for cancellation of your RUE grant.

          § 550.167   How may I obtain or assign my interest in a RUE?

#### § § 550.167

          (a) To obtain a RUE or request an assignment of an interest in a RUE, the applicant or assignee must file an application and provide the information contained in § 550.161 if a change in uses is planned and must obtain BOEM's approval.

          (b) An application for approval of an assignment of an interest in a RUE, in whole or in part, must be filed in triplicate with the Regional Director. Such application must be supported by a statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the RUE grant. The assignee must satisfy the bonding requirements in § 550.166. No RUE assignment will be recognized unless and until it is first approved, in writing, by the Regional Director. The assignee of an interest in a RUE must pay the same service fee as that listed in § 550.106(a)(1) for a lease record title assignment request.

          (c) BOEM may disapprove an assignment in the following circumstances:

          (1) When the assignee has unsatisfied obligations under the regulations in this chapter or in chapters II or XII of this title, or under any applicable BOEM or BSEE order;

          (2) When an assignment is not acceptable as to form or content (e.g., containing incorrect legal description, not executed by a person authorized to bind the corporation, assignee does not meet the requirements of §§ 556.401 through 556.405 of this subchapter);

          (3) When the assignment does not comply with or would conflict with this part, or any other applicable laws or regulations (e.g., Departmental debarment rules); or

          (4) When the assignee does not meet the applicable financial assurance requirements in § 550.166 and part 556, subpart I of this subchapter, or has not complied with a BOEM or BSEE order.

Section 550.185 states conditions under which you will receive no compensation. The Secretary may cancel a lease after notice and opportunity for a hearing when:

          (a) Continued activity on the lease would probably cause harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment;

          (b) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time;

          (c) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease in force; and

#### § § 550.182

          BOEM may not approve an exploration plan (EP) under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B, if the Regional Supervisor determines that the proposed activities may cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits, the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment, and that the proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the condition(s). The Secretary may cancel the lease if:

          (a) The primary lease term has not expired (or if the lease term has been extended) and exploration has been prohibited for 5 years following the disapproval; or

          (b) You request cancellation at an earlier time.

          § 550.183   When may BOEM or the Secretary extend or cancel a lease at the development and production stage?

          (2) Any time within 5 years after the disapproval, you may reapply for approval of the same or a modified plan; and

          (3) The Regional Supervisor will approve, disapprove, or require modification of the plan under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B.

          (b) If the Regional Supervisor has not approved a DPP or required you to submit a DPP for approval or modification, the Secretary will cancel the lease:

          (1) When the 5-year period in paragraph (a)(1) of this section expires; or

          § 550.184   What is the amount of compensation for lease cancellation?

#### § § 550.184

          When the Secretary cancels a lease under §§ 550.181, 550.182 or 550.183 of this subpart, you are entitled to receive compensation under 43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)(C). You must show the Director that the amount of compensation claimed is the lesser of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section:

          (a) The fair value of the cancelled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both:

          (1) Anticipated revenues from the lease; and

          (2) Costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, including:

          (i) Costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders; and

          (c) Compensation for leases issued before September 18, 1978, will be equal to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

          § 550.185   When is there no compensation for a lease cancellation?

#### § § 550.185

          You will not receive compensation from BOEM for lease cancellation if:

          (b) You do not submit a DPP under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B or do not comply with the approved DPP;

          (c) As the lessee of a nonproducing lease, you fail to comply with the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, and the default continues for 30 days after BOEM mails you a notice by overnight mail;

#### § § 550.186

          (a) You must submit information and reports as BOEM requires.

          (1) You may obtain copies of forms from, and submit completed forms to, the Regional Supervisor.

          (2) Instead of paper copies of forms available from the Regional Supervisor, you may use your own computer-generated forms that are equal in size to BOEM's forms. You must arrange the data on your form identical to the BOEM form. If you generate your own form and it omits terms and conditions contained on the official BOEM form, we will consider it to contain the omitted terms and conditions.

          (3) You may submit digital data when the Region is equipped to accept it.

          (b) When BOEM specifies, you must include, for public information, an additional copy of such reports.

          (1) You must mark it

#### § §§ 550.187-550.193

          § 550.194   How must I conduct my approved activities to protect archaeological resources?

#### § § 550.194

          (a) To protect archaeological resources, your EP, DOCD, or DPP that proposes activities involving disturbance of the seafloor must be accompanied by or contain one of the following:

          (1) An archaeological report based on a high-resolution geophysical (HRG) survey of the APE defined, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.16(d) of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations implementing section 106 of the NHPA, as the depth and breadth of the seabed that could potentially be impacted by proposed activities;

          (2) A reference to an archaeological report based on an HRG survey of the APE that you previously submitted for your lease, provided that any previously submitted survey complies with the survey parameters identified in these regulations and the results of the survey are, in BOEM's judgment, valid. BOEM may consider a survey or the resulting report to be invalid if BOEM suspects that changes to the seafloor environment warrant acquiring additional data, considering, for example, the time elapsed since the prior survey or change in seafloor from a geological event such as a mudslide; or

          (3) Evidence demonstrating to BOEM's satisfaction that a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological resources within the APE has already been performed, provided that the past efforts are sufficient to identify possible marine archaeological resources at a degree of certainty reasonably similar to or better than an HRG survey.

          (b) The archaeological report and evidence described in paragraph (a) of this section must have been or be prepared and signed by a qualified marine archaeologist. A qualified marine archaeologist must meet the Secretary of the Interior's “Standards and Guidelines for Historic Preservation Projects: Professional Qualifications Standards” as developed per the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 306131), and any subsequent updates to those standards and guidelines, and must have experience in conducting or overseeing HRG surveys and processing and interpreting the resulting data for archaeological potential.

          (c) The geophysical survey resolution for the surveys described in paragraph (a) of this section must be sufficiently detailed to identify potential archaeological resources and must be performed using instrumentation and methodology that is state-of-the-art and that meets or exceeds scientific standards for conducting marine archaeological surveys. The surveys must, at a minimum, adhere to the following operational requirements and performance standards:

          (1) A state-of-the-art navigation system with sub-meter accuracy able to continuously determine the surface position of the survey vessel and in-water position of towed and autonomous survey sensors. Position fixes must be digitally and continuously logged along the vessel track. Geodesy information must be clearly presented and consistent across all data types. Navigation systems meeting the criteria outlined in this section do not require prior approval by BOEM.

          (2) For geophysical surveys conducted in water depths of 100 meters (328 feet) or less, the survey must employ a total field magnetometer, gradiometer, or other similar instrument having equal or superior measurement capability. The magnetometer, gradiometer, or its equivalent must be towed as close to the seafloor as possible and sufficiently far from the vessel to isolate the sensor from the magnetic field of the survey vessel and the other survey instruments. The magnetometer, gradiometer, or its equivalent must be towed at a sufficient altitude to detect ferrous metals or other magnetically susceptible materials of at least 1,000 pounds (453 kilograms) in mass with a minimum magnetic deflection of 5 gamma (γ; 5 nanotesla [nT]). An accurate method must be used to record the height of the magnetometer, gradiometer, or its equivalent in the water column. The altitude of the magnetometer, gradiometer, or its equivalent must be continuously recorded during data acquisition along the survey. The instrument's sensitivity must be 1 γ (1 nT) or less. Background noise level must not exceed a total of 3 γ peak to peak with data samples of at least 2 points per meter along the survey track. All collected data must be recorded on a digital medium that can be linked electronically to the positioning data. Survey line, time, position, altitude, and speed must be annotated on all output data. The data must be post-processed and contoured in a manner to best facilitate the interpretation of potential archaeological resources.

          (3) For geophysical surveys conducted to locate potential areas of prior human occupation, a sub-bottom profiler system must be used to identify and map buried geomorphological features of archaeological potential that may exist within the horizontal and vertical APE, taking into account the geomorphology of the operational area and the parameters of the proposed project (including the maximum depth of disturbance from the proposed activities). The use of a sub-bottom profiler is required in water depths of 140 meters or less, unless BOEM specifies a different water depth based on its determination of the furthest extent of prior human occupation on the OCS. The sub-bottom profiler system must be capable of achieving a depth of penetration and resolution of vertical bed separation that is sufficient to allow for the identification and cross-track mapping of features of archaeological potential (e.g., shell middens, paleochannels, levees, inset terraces, paleolagoon systems, and other relict landforms). The sub-bottom profiler system employed must be capable of achieving a resolution of vertical bed separation of at least 0.3 meters (1 foot) in the uppermost 10 to 15 meters (33 to 50 feet) of sediments, depending on the substrate.

          (4) In all water depths, a side-scan sonar or equivalent system must be used to provide continuous planimetric imagery of the seafloor to identify potential archaeological resources on and partly embedded in the seafloor. To provide sufficient resolution of seafloor features, BOEM requires the use of a system that operates at as high a frequency as practicable based on the factors of line spacing, instrument range, and water depth. The sonar system must detect small, discrete targets 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) in length at maximum range, along the track. The instrument range must provide at least 100 percent overlapping coverage ( 200 percent seafloor coverage) between adjacent primary survey lines. Greater than 200 percent overlapping coverage may be necessary to guarantee nadir coverage and account for survey vessel drift between lines, which may be an important consideration when surveying in deep water. The side-scan sonar sensor must be towed above the seafloor at a height that is 10 to 20 percent of the range of the instrument. Data must be digitally recorded and visually displayed to monitor data quality and identify targets of interest during acquisition. The data must be post-processed to improve data quality by, for example, adjusting for slant range effects and variable speed along line.

          (5) In all water depths, an echo sounder or equivalent system must be used to measure accurate water depths across the area. Where swath bathymetry data are acquired, it is recommended that backscatter values from the seabed returns are logged and processed for use in seabed characterization to support and complement the side scan sonar data. Single beam echo sounder data (or data from the equivalent system) must be used to verify the results of swath bathymetry data to check for gross error. The bathymetry systems must be set up to accurately record data across the range of water depths expected in the survey area. Care must be taken in selection of operating frequencies such that the individual systems do not interfere with each other. The bathymetry systems must be used in conjunction with an accurate motion sensor to compensate for vessel motion. Water column sound velocity must be determined as a minimum at the start and end of data acquisition, and at suitable intervals throughout the project, by use of a conductivity, salinity, and temperature depth probe or a direct reading sound velocity probe suitable for use in the maximum water depths expected within the survey area. Water depths must be corrected for vessel draft, tidal level, and referenced to the appropriate vertical datum (LAT, MSL, etc.). The final processed digital terrain model data cell size covering the entire survey area, without gaps, must reflect the frequency of the system being used, data density, and altitude above seabed of the transducer head.

          (6) An archaeological survey conducted prior to the effective date of these regulations may be used in lieu of conducting a new survey, subject to BOEM approval, provided the lessee or operator can demonstrate that such survey was conducted in such a manner as to meet the objectives of this paragraph (c).

          (d) The Regional Director may approve a departure from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section on a case-by-case basis if the Regional Director deems the departure necessary because the applicable requirements, as applied to a specific circumstance:

          (1) Are impractical or unduly burdensome;

          (2) Are not necessary to achieve the intended objectives of the marine archaeology program;

          (3) Fail to conserve the natural resources of the OCS;

          (4) Fail to protect life (including human and wildlife), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment; or

          (5) Fail to protect sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance.

          (e) Any departure approved under this section must:

          (1) Be consistent with requirements of the OCS Lands Act;

          (2) Protect the archaeological resources to the same degree as if there was no approved departure from the regulations;

          (3) Satisfy section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and achieve results for identifying archaeological resources as if there was no approved departure from the regulations;

          (4) Not impair the rights of third parties; and

          (5) Be documented in writing.

          (f) BOEM may reject any archaeological report if the survey was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) in this section or any BOEM-approved departure to the survey requirements. BOEM may also reject any archaeological report if the results produced from the survey do not meet the data and resolution requirements specified under paragraph (c), regardless of whether the survey was otherwise conducted appropriately.

          (g) If the archaeological report or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, you must:

          (1) Situate your operations so as not to adversely affect the area where the known or suspected archaeological resource may be located; or,

          (2) Establish, to the satisfaction of the Regional Director, that an archaeological resource does not exist by conducting further archaeological investigation, under the supervision of a qualified marine archaeologist, using equipment and techniques the Regional Director considers appropriate. You must submit a report documenting the further investigation to the Regional Director for review;

          (i) If the further investigation cannot establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an archaeological resource is not likely to be present at the operational site, you must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that your operations will not adversely affect the suspected resource; or,

          (ii) If, based on the additional archaeological investigation, the Regional Director determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the operational site and may be adversely affected by operations, you must take whatever additional steps are specified by the Regional Director to protect the archaeological resource before you conduct any further operations at the operational site; or,

          (3) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the lease area, that it is likely to be adversely affected by your operations, and that there are no feasible means to avoid this adverse effect, the Regional Director may prohibit your operations in the APE.

          (h) Any lessee or operator that has an existing lease in effect prior to October 3, 2024 may apply the regulations in effect prior to this date with respect to the provisions of this section for such lease for a period of time not to exceed September 3, 2025.

          (b)  (1) An affected State has not yet issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification (see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or

          (2) An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security.

          (3) If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security. In that event, you do not need to resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under § 550.273(b).

          (c)  Your proposed activities would threaten National security or defense.

          (d)  The Regional Supervisor determines because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances that all of the following apply:

          (1) Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the National security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;

          (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and

          (3) The advantages of disapproving your DPP or DOCD outweigh the advantages of development and production.

          § 550.272   If a State objects to the DPP's or DOCD's coastal zone consistency certification, what can I do?

#### § § 550.272

          If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your proposed or disapproved DPP or DOCD, you may do one of the following:

          (a)  Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment or resubmittal to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment or resubmittal needs to only address information related to the State's objections.

          (b)  Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:

          (1) Grant your appeal by finding under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in detail in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security; or

          (2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c)  Withdraw your DPP or DOCD if you decide not to conduct your proposed development and production activities.

          § 550.273   How do I submit a modified DPP or DOCD or resubmit a disapproved DPP or DOCD?

#### § § 550.273

          (a)  If the Regional Supervisor requires you to modify your proposed DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(2), you must submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner as for a new DPP or DOCD. You need submit only information related to the proposed modification(s).

          (b)  If the Regional Supervisor disapproves your DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(3), and except as provided in § 550.271(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved DPP or DOCD if there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its disapproval.

          (c)  The Regional Supervisor will use the performance standards in § 550.202 to either approve, require you to further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD, whichever occurs later.

        § 550.303   Facilities described in a new or revised Exploration Plan, Development and Production Plan, or Development Operations Coordination Document.

#### § § 550.303

        (a)  All Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations Coordination Documents shall include the information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section, and the lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.

        (b)  (1) The Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan, Development and Production Plan, or Development Operations Coordination Document to determine whether any facility described in the plan should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air quality status of the onshore area.

        (2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to the information required in § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and to submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.

        (c)  All revised Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations Coordination Documents shall include the information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.

        (d)  To determine whether a facility described in an initial, modified, supplemental, or revised Exploration Plan, Development and Production Plan, or Development Operations Coordination Document is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee must use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility calculated for each criteria air pollutant, VOC, and TSP listed in § 550.**2**49(a) or § 550.218(a) and compare these emissions to the emission exemption threshold (EET) calculated using the following formulas: EET = 3400*D for carbon monoxide (CO); and EET = 33.3*D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NO), utilizing NO as the indicator pollutant for NO and VOC (where EET is the emission exemption threshold expressed in short tons per year, and D is the distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore area of a State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption threshold (EET) for the corresponding criteria air pollutant, VOC, and TSP, the facility is exempt from further air quality review required under paragraphs (e) through (i) of this section.

        (e)  (1) For a facility not exempt under paragraph (d) of this section, the lessee must use a BOEM approved air quality model to determine whether projected emissions from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above any SL set forth in the following table:

        (2) In the event that the emissions of TSP exceed the EET for TSP, the lessee must use a BOEM approved air quality model to determine whether the projected emissions from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the SL for either PM or PM.

        (f)  (1) The projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant from any facility that result in an onshore ambient air concentration above a SL determined under paragraph (e) of this section for that criteria air pollutant will be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for that criteria air pollutant.

        (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not exempt under paragraph (d) of this section will be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for VOC.

        (g)  (1) The projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant from any facility, except a temporary facility, which significantly affect the quality of a nonattainment area, shall be fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.

        (2) The projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant from any facility which significantly affect the air quality of an attainment or unclassifiable area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.

        (i)(A) Except for temporary facilities, the lessee also shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether the emissions of TSP or SO that remain after the application of BACT cause the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentrations established in 40 CFR 5*2*.21 to be exceeded in the attainment or unclassifiable area:

        (B) No concentration of an criteria air pollutant shall exceed the concentration permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality standard or the concentration permitted under the national primary air quality standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the criteria air pollutant for the period of exposure. For any period other than the annual period, the applicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such period per year at any one onshore location.

        (ii) If the maximum allowable increases are exceeded, the lessee shall apply whatever additional emission controls are necessary to reduce or offset the remaining emissions of TSP or SO so that concentrations in the onshore ambient air of an attainment or unclassifiable area do not exceed the maximum allowable increases.

        (3)(i) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, which significantly affect the onshore air quality of a nonattainment area shall be fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.

        (ii) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which significantly affect the onshore air quality of an attainment area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.

        (4)(i) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the onshore air quality of both a nonattainment and an attainment or unclassifiable area, the regulatory requirements applicable to projected emissions significantly affecting a nonattainment area shall apply.

        (ii) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the onshore air quality of more than one class of attainment area, the lessee must reduce projected emissions to meet the maximum allowable increases specified for each class in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.

        (h)  The lessee must apply BACT to reduce projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant or VOC from a temporary facility that significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area of a State.

        (i)  When emission offsets are to be obtained, the lessee must demonstrate that the offsets are equivalent in nature and quantity to the projected emissions that must be reduced after the application of BACT; a binding commitment exists between the lessee and the owner or owners of the source or sources; the appropriate air quality control jurisdiction has been notified of the need to revise the State Implementation Plan to include the information regarding the offsets; and the required offsets come from sources which affect the air quality of the area significantly affected by the lessee's offshore operations.

        (j)  If, during the review of a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan, Development and Production Plan, or Development Operations Coordination Document, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether emission control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an onshore area of the State.

        (k)  The lessee shall monitor, in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from the facility. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.

        (l)  The Regional Supervisor may require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit meteorological data from a facility.

#### § § 550.304

        (a)  (1) An affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the emission inventory.

        (2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing facilities to submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may submit information from its emission inventory which indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of the State.

        (4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State.

        (5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain the reasons for this finding.

        (6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to the information requirements under § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.

        (b)  To determine whether an existing facility is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee must use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility calculated for each criteria air pollutant, VOC, and TSP listed in § 550.**2**49(a) or § 550.218(a) and compare these emissions to the emission exemption threshold (EET) calculated using the following formulas: EET = 3400*D for carbon monoxide (CO); and EET = 33.3*D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NO), utilizing NO as the indicator pollutant for NO and VOC (where EET is the emission exemption threshold expressed in short tons per year, and D is the distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore area of a State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption threshold (EET) for the corresponding criteria air pollutant, VOC, and TSP, the facility is exempt from further air quality review required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

        (c)  For a facility not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section, the lessee must use a BOEM approved air quality model to determine whether the projected emissions from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above any SL set forth in § 550.303(e). In the event that the emissions of TSP exceed the EET for TSP, the lessee must use a BOEM approved air quality model to determine whether the projected emissions from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the SL for either PM or PM

        (d)  (1) The projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant from any facility that result in an onshore ambient air concentration above an SL determined under paragraph (c) of this section for that criteria air pollutant, will be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for that criteria air pollutant.

        (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, which is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section, will be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for VOC.

        (e)  (1) The projected emissions of any criteria air pollutant or VOC that significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area must be reduced through the application of BACT.

        (2) The lessee shall submit a compliance schedule for the application of BACT. If it is necessary to cease operations to allow for the installation of emission controls, the lessee may apply for a suspension of operations under the provisions of 30 CFR 250.174.

        (f)  If, during the review of the information required under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an onshore area of the State.

        (g)  The lessee shall monitor, in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from the facility following the installation of emission controls. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.

        (h)  The Regional Supervisor may require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit meteorological data from a facility.

The requirement to furnish and maintain area-wide financial assurance for a pipeline ROW grant is separate and distinct from the requirement to provide financial assurance for a lease or right-of-use and easement (RUE).

        (b) The requirement to furnish and maintain area-wide pipeline ROW financial assurance under paragraph (a) of this section may be satisfied if your operator or a co-grant holder provides such financial assurance in the required amount that guarantees compliance with the regulations and the terms and conditions of the grant.

        (c) The requirements for lease financial assurance in §§ 556.900(d) through (g) and 556.902 of this subchapter apply to the area-wide financial assurance required in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) The Regional Director, using the criteria set forth in § 556.901(d)(1) through (3) of this subchapter, will evaluate your financial ability to carry out present and future obligations, and as a result, may require supplemental financial assurance ( above the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section) to ensure compliance with the obligations under your pipeline right-of-way grant.

        (e) The supplemental financial assurance required under paragraph (d) of this section must:

        (1) Meet the requirements of §§ 556.900(d) through (g) and 556.902 of this subchapter, and

        (2) Cover costs and liabilities for compliance with the obligations of your ROW grants and with applicable BOEM and BSEE orders.

        (f) If you fail to replace any deficient financial assurance upon demand or fail to provide supplemental financial assurance upon demand, the Regional Director may:

        (1) Assess penalties under subpart N of this part;

        (2) Request BSEE to suspend operations on your pipeline ROW; and/or

        (3) Initiate action for forfeiture of your pipeline ROW grant in accordance with § 250.1013 of this title.

#### § § 550.1496

          (a) BOEM bond-approving officer will determine your financial solvency by examining your total net worth, including, as appropriate, the net worth of your affiliated entities.

          (b) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 for all orders you have appealed is greater than $300 million, you are presumptively deemed financially solvent, and we will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument.

          (c) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 for all orders you have appealed is less than $300 million, you must submit the following to BOEM by one of the methods in § 550.1495(a):

          (1) A written request asking us to consult a business-information, or credit-reporting service or program to determine your financial solvency; and

          (2) A nonrefundable $50 processing fee:

          (d) If you request that we consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under paragraph (c) of this section:

          (1) We will use criteria similar to that which a potential creditor would use to lend an amount equal to the bond or other surety instrument we would require under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491;

          (2) For us to consider you financially solvent, the business-information or credit-reporting service or program must demonstrate your degree of risk as low to moderate:

          (i) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information demonstrates your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491;

          (ii) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information does not demonstrate your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 or pay the obligation.

          § 550.1497   When will BOEM monitor my financial solvency?

#### § § 550.1497

          (a) If you are presumptively financially solvent under § 550.1496(b), BOEM will determine your net worth as described under §§ 550.1496(b) and (c) to evaluate your financial solvency at least annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.

          (b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under § 550.1496(c), we will consult a service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.

          (c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer financially solvent, you must post a bond or other BOEM-specified surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491.

      § 551.14   Protecting and disclosing data and information submitted to BOEM under a permit.

#### § § 551.14

      (a)  (1) In making data and information available to the public, the Regional Director will follow the applicable requirements of:

      (i) The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);

      (ii) The implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2;

      (iii) The Act; and

      (iv) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550 and 552.

      (2) Except as specified in this section or in 30 CFR parts 550 and 552, if the Regional Director determines any data or information is exempt from public disclosure under this paragraph (a), BOEM will not provide the data and information to any State or to the executive of any local government or to the public, unless you and all third parties agree to the disclosure.

      (3) BOEM will keep confidential the identity of third party recipients of data and information collected under a permit. BOEM will not release the identity unless you and the third parties agree to the disclosure.

      (4) When you detect any significant hydrocarbon occurrences or environmental hazards on unleased lands during drilling operations, the Regional Director will immediately issue a public announcement. The announcement must further the National interest, but without unduly damaging your competitive position.

      (b)  Except for high-resolution data and information released under 30 CFR 550.197(b)(2), BOEM will release or disclose acquired data and information in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section.

      (1) If the data and information are not related to a deep stratigraphic test, BOEM will release them to the public in accordance with the following table:

      (2) Permittees and third parties may apply to BOEM for an extension of the 25-year proprietary term for geophysical information reprocessed 20 or more years after BOEM issued the germane permit. You must submit the application to BOEM within 90 days after completion of the reprocessing, except during the initial 1-year grace period as provided in paragraph (b)(5) below. Filing locations are listed in § 551.5(d). Your application must include:

      (i) Name and address of the permittee or third party;

      (ii) Product name;

      (3) With each new reprocessing of permitted data, you may apply for an extension of up to 5 years. However, the maximum proprietary term for geophysical information is 50 years after the permit was issued. Once the maximum term is reached, the BOEM Regional Director will release the information to the public.

      (4) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed 20 or more years after the germane permit was issued and granted the extension will be subject to submission, inspection, and selection criteria under § 551.12 and reimbursement criteria identified under § 551.13.

      (5) There was a 1-year grace period, that started September 14, 2009, that allowed permittees and third parties sufficient time to meet the above requirements and apply for all eligible extensions. During that time, BOEM did not release geophysical information which was reprocessed 20 or more years after the date that the germane permit was issued.

      (6) Since September 14, 2010, BOEM has resumed releasing eligible reprocessed information. If an application for extension was not filed, not filed on time, or not approved by BOEM, the original 25-year proprietary term applies to the release date of the reprocessed geophysical information.

      (7) If the data and information are related to a deep stratigraphic test, BOEM will release them to the public at the earlier of the following times:

      (i) Twenty-five years after you complete the test; or

      (ii) If a lease sale is held after you complete a test well, 60-calendar days after BOEM issues the first lease, any portion of which is located within 50 geographic miles (92.7 kilometers) of the test.

      (8) BOEM may allow limited inspection, but only by persons with a direct interest in related BOEM decisions and issues in specific geographic areas, and who agree in writing to its confidentiality, of G&G data and information submitted under this part that BOEM uses to:

      (i) Make unitization determinations on two or more leases;

      (ii) Make competitive reservoir determinations;

      (iii) Ensure proper plans of development for competitive reservoirs;

      (iv) Promote operational safety;

      (v) Protect the environment;

      (vi) Make field determinations; or

      (vii) Determine eligibility for royalty relief.

      (c)  (1) When practical, the Regional Director will advise the person who submitted data and information under § 551.11 or § 551.12 of the intent to disclose the data or information to an independent contractor or agent.

      (2) The person so notified will have at least 5 working days to comment on the action.

      (3) When the Regional Director advises the person who submitted the data and information, all other owners of the data or information will be considered to have been so notified.

      (4) Before disclosure, the contractor or agent must sign a written commitment not to sell, trade, license, or disclose data or information to anyone without the Regional Director's consent.

      (d)  (1) When BOEM solicits nominations for leasing lands located within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and subsections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will provide the Governor with:

      (i) All information on the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of the areas and regions BOEM proposes to offer for lease;

      (ii) An estimate of the oil and gas reserves in the areas proposed for leasing; and

      (iii) An identification of any field, geological structure, or trap on the OCS within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of the State.

      (2) After receiving nominations for leasing an area of the OCS within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, BOEM will carry out a tentative area identification according to 30 CFR part 556, subparts D and E. At that time, the Regional Director will consult with the Governor to determine whether any tracts further considered for leasing may contain any oil or gas reservoirs that underlie both the OCS and lands subject to the jurisdiction of the State.

      (3) Before a sale, if a Governor requests, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and sections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will share with the Governor information that identifies potential and/or proven common hydrocarbon bearing areas within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of that State.

      (4) Information received and knowledge gained by a State official under paragraph (d) of this section is subject to applicable confidentiality requirements of:

      (i) The Act; and

      (ii) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550, 551, and 552.

BOEM uses the information to ensure compliance of offshore lessees, owners, and operators of covered facilities with OPA; to establish eligibility of designated applicants for OSFR certification (OSFRC); and to establish a reference source of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of responsible parties for covered facilities and their designated agents, guarantors, and U.S. agents for service of process for claims associated with oil pollution from designated covered facilities. The requirement to provide the information is mandatory. No information submitted for OSFRC is confidential or proprietary.

        (c) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

        (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.

      Subpart B—Applicability and Amount of OSFR

        § 553.10   What facilities does this part cover?

#### § § 553.10

        (a) This part applies to any COF on any lease or permit issued or on any RUE granted under the OCSLA or applicable State law.

        (b) For a pipeline COF that extends onto land, this part applies to that portion of the pipeline lying seaward of the first accessible flow shut-off device on land.

        § 553.11   Who must demonstrate OSFR?

#### § § 553.11

        (a) A designated applicant must demonstrate OSFR. A designated applicant may be a responsible party or another person authorized under this section. Each COF must have a single designated applicant.

        (1) If there is more than one responsible party, those responsible parties must use Form BOEM-1017 to select a designated applicant. The designated applicant must submit Form BOEM-1016 and agree to demonstrate OSFR on behalf of all the responsible parties.

        (2) If you are a designated applicant who is not a responsible party, you must agree to be liable for claims made under OPA jointly and severally with the responsible parties.

        (b) The designated applicant for a COF on a lease must be either:

        (1) A lessee; or

        (2) The designated operator for the OCS lease under 30 CFR 550.143 or the unit operator designated under a Federally approved unit including the OCS lease. For a lease or unit not in the OCS, the operator designated under the lease or unit operating agreement for the lease may be the designated applicant only if the operator has agreed to be responsible for compliance with all the laws and regulations applicable to the lease or unit.

        (c) The designated applicant for a COF on a permit must be the permittee.

        (d) The designated applicant for a COF on a RUE must be the holder of the RUE or, if there is a pipeline on the RUE, the owner or operator of the pipeline.

        (e) BOEM may require the designated applicant for a lease, permit, or RUE to be a person other than a person identified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section if BOEM determines that a person identified in paragraphs (b) through (d) cannot adequately demonstrate OSFR.

        (f) If you are a responsible party and you fail to designate an applicant, then you must demonstrate OSFR under the requirements of this part.

        § 553.12   May I ask BOEM for a determination of whether I must demonstrate OSFR?

#### § § 553.12

        You may submit to BOEM a request for a determination of OSFR applicability. Address the request to the office identified in § 553.45. You must include in your request any information that will assist BOEM in making the determination. BOEM may require you to submit other information before making a determination of OSFR applicability.

        § 553.13   How much OSFR must I demonstrate?

#### § § 553.13

        (a) The following general parameters apply to the amount of OSFR that you must demonstrate:

        (b) You must demonstrate OSFR in the amounts specified in this section:

        (1) For a COF located wholly or partially in the OCS you must demonstrate OSFR in accordance with the following table:

        (2) For a COF not located in the OCS you must demonstrate OSFR in accordance with the following table:

        (3) The Director may determine that you must demonstrate an amount of OSFR greater than the amount in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, and other risks that your COF poses. The Director may require an amount that is one or more levels higher than the amount indicated in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for your COF. The Director will not require an OSFR demonstration that exceeds $150 million.

        (4) You must demonstrate OSFR in the lowest amount specified in the applicable table in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for a facility with a potential worst case oil-spill discharge of 1,000 bbls or less if the Director notifies you in writing that the demonstration is justified by the risks of the potential oil-spill discharge.

        § 553.14   How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge volume?

#### § § 553.14

        (a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a facility under § 553.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following regulations applies:

        (1) 30 CFR part 254—Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume that you estimate for the first 24 hours.

        (2) 40 CFR part 112—Oil Pollution Prevention; or

        (3) 49 CFR part 194—Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.

        (b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate $150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR required under this part.

        § 553.15   What are my general OSFR compliance responsibilities?

#### § § 553.15

        (a) You must maintain continuous OSFR coverage for all your leases, permits, and RUEs with COFs for which you are the designated applicant.

        (b) You must ensure that new OSFR evidence is submitted before your current evidence lapses or is canceled and that coverage for your new COF is submitted before the COF goes into operation.

        (c) If you use self-insurance to demonstrate OSFR and find that you no longer qualify to self-insure the required OSFR amount based upon your latest audited annual financial statements, then you must demonstrate OSFR using other methods acceptable to BOEM by whichever of the following dates comes first:

        (1) Sixty calendar days after you receive your latest audited annual financial statement; or

        (2) The first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your fiscal year.

        (d) You may use a surety bond to demonstrate OSFR. If you find that your bonding company has lost its state license or has had its U.S. Treasury Department certification revoked, then you must replace the surety bond within 15 calendar days using a method of OSFR that is acceptable to BOEM.

        (e) You must notify BOEM in writing within 15 calendar days after a change occurs that would prevent you from meeting your OSFR obligations (e.g., if you or your indemnitor petition for bankruptcy under chapters 7 or 11 of Title 11, U.S.C.). You must take any action BOEM directs to ensure an acceptable OSFR demonstration.

        (f) If you deny payment of a claim presented to you under § 553.60, then you must give the claimant a written explanation for your denial.

      Subpart C—Methods for Demonstrating OSFR

        § 553.20   What methods may I use to demonstrate OSFR?

        (d) The smaller of the numbers calculated under paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section is the maximum allowable amount you may use to demonstrate OSFR under this method.

        § 553.26   What information must I submit to support my unencumbered assets demonstration?

#### § § 553.26

        You must support your unencumbered assets evaluation with the information required by § 553.23(a) and a list of reserved, unencumbered, and unimpaired U.S. assets whose value will not be affected by an oil discharge from a COF.

        (4) The valuation method used in the audited annual financial statements is for long-term assets held for use.

        § 553.28   What financial test procedures must I use to evaluate the amount of self-insurance allowed as OSFR evidence based on unencumbered assets?

#### § § 553.28

        (a) Divide the total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity listed on the balance sheet by 4.

        (a) If you use insurance to satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR, you may use only insurance certificates issued by insurers that have achieved a “Secure” rating for claims paying ability in their latest review by A.M. Best's Insurance Reports, Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Services, or other equivalent rating made by a rating service acceptable to BOEM.

        (b) You must submit information about your insurers to BOEM on a completed and unaltered Form BOEM-1019. The information you submit must:

        (1) Include all the information required by § 553.41 and

        (2) Be executed on one original insurance certificate ( Form BOEM-1019) for each OSFR layer (see paragraph (c) of this section), showing all participating insurers and their proportion (quota share) of this risk. The certificate must bear the original signatures of each insurer's underwriter or of their lead underwriters, underwriting managers, or delegated brokers, depending on who is authorized to bind the underwriter.

        (3) For each insurance company on the insurance certificate, indicate the insurer's claims-paying-ability rating and the rating service that issued the rating.

        (c) The insurance evidence you provide to BOEM as OSFR evidence may be divided into layers, subject to the following restrictions:

        (1) The total amount of OSFR evidence must equal the total amount you must demonstrate under § 553.13;

        (2) No more than one insurance certificate may be used to cover each OSFR layer specified in § 553.13(b) ( four layers for an OCS COF, and five layers for a non-OCS COF);

        (3) You may use one insurance certificate to cover any number of consecutive OSFR layers;

        (4) Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain intermediate, horizontal layers;

        (5) You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are acceptable as evidence of OSFR under this part; and

        (6) You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process on each insurance certificate you submit to BOEM. The agent may be different for each insurance certificate.

        (d) You may submit to BOEM a temporary insurance confirmation (fax binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit your fax binder on Form BOEM-1019, and each form must include the signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating insurers. BOEM will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to demonstrate OSFR.

        (d) You must submit your application to renew OSFR using an indemnity by the first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your indemnitor's fiscal year. You may submit to BOEM your initial application to demonstrate OSFR using an indemnity at any time.

        (e) Your indemnitor must identify a U.S. agent for service of process.

        § 553.31   How can I use a surety bond as OSFR evidence?

#### § § 553.31

        (a) Each bonding company that issues a surety bond that you submit to BOEM as OSFR evidence must:

        (1) Be licensed to do business in the State in which the surety bond is executed;

        (2) Be certified by the U.S. Treasury Department as an acceptable surety for Federal obligations and listed in the current Treasury Circular No. 570;

        (3) Provide the surety bond on Form BOEM-1020; and

        (4) Be in compliance with applicable statutes regulating surety company participation in insurance-type risks.

        (b) A surety bond that you submit as OSFR evidence must include all the information required by § 553.41.

        § 553.32   Are there alternative methods to demonstrate OSFR?

#### § § 553.32

        The Director may accept other methods to demonstrate OSFR that provide equivalent assurance of timely satisfaction of claims. This may include pooling, letters of credit, pledges of treasury notes, or other comparable methods. Submit your proposal, together with all the supporting documents, to the Director at the address listed in § 553.45. The Director's decision whether to approve your alternative method to evidence OSFR is by this rule committed to the Director's sole discretion and is not subject to administrative appeal under 30 CFR part 590 or 43 CFR part 4.

      Subpart D—Requirements for Submitting OSFR Information

        § 553.40   What OSFR evidence must I submit to BOEM?

#### § § 553.40

        (6) Other financial instruments and information the Director requires to support your OSFR demonstration under § 553.32.

        (b) Each BOEM form you submit to BOEM as part of your OSFR demonstration must be signed. You also must attach to Form BOEM-1016 proof of your authority to sign.

        § 553.41   What terms must I include in my OSFR evidence?

#### § § 553.41

        (a) Each instrument you submit as OSFR evidence must specify:

        (1) The effective date, and except for a surety bond, the expiration date;

        (2) That termination of the instrument will not affect the liability of the instrument issuer for claims arising from an incident ( oil-spill discharge or substantial threat of the discharge of oil) that occurred on or before the effective date of termination;

        (3) That the instrument will remain in force until the termination date or until the earlier of:

        (i) Thirty calendar days after BOEM and the designated applicant receive from the instrument issuer a notification of intent to cancel; or

        (b) You may not change, omit, or add limitations or exceptions to the terms and conditions in a BOEM form that you submit as part of your OSFR demonstration. If you attempt to do this, BOEM will disregard the changes, omissions, additions, limitations, or exceptions and by operation of this rule BOEM will consider the form to contain all the terms and conditions included on the original BOEM form.

        § 553.42   How can I amend my list of COFs?

#### § § 553.42

        (a) If you want to add a COF that is not identified in your current OSFR demonstration, you must submit to BOEM a completed Form BOEM-1022. If applicable, you also must submit any additional indemnities, surety bonds, insurance certificates, or other instruments required to extend the coverage of your original OSFR demonstration to the COFs to be added. You do not need to resubmit previously accepted audited annual financial statements for the current fiscal year.

        (b) If you want to drop a COF identified in your current OSFR demonstration, you must submit to BOEM a completed Form BOEM-1022. You must continue to demonstrate OSFR for the COF until BOEM approves OSFR evidence for the COF from another designated applicant, or OSFR is no longer required (e.g., until a well that is a COF is properly plugged and abandoned).

        § 553.43   When is my OSFR demonstration or the amendment to my OSFR demonstration effective?

#### § § 553.43

        (a) BOEM will notify you in writing when we approve your OSFR demonstration. If we find that you have not submitted all the information needed to demonstrate OSFR, we may require you to provide additional information before we determine whether your OSFR evidence is acceptable.

        (b) Except in the case of self-insurance or an indemnity, BOEM acceptance of OSFR evidence is valid until the surety bond, insurance certificate, or other accepted OSFR instrument expires or is canceled. In the case of self-insurance or indemnity, acceptance is valid until the first day of the 5th month after the close of your or your indemnitor's current fiscal year.

      Subpart G—Limit of Liability for Offshore Facilities

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 73840, Dec. 12, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

        § 553.700   What is the scope of this subpart?

#### § § 553.700

        This subpart sets forth the limit of liability for damages for offshore facilities under Title I of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2701 ) (OPA), as adjusted, under section 1004(d) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)). This subpart also sets forth the method for adjusting the limit of liability for damages for offshore facilities for inflation, by regulation, under section 1004(d) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)).

        § 553.701   To which entities does this subpart apply?

#### § § 553.701

        This subpart applies to you if you are a responsible party for an offshore facility, other than a deepwater port under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501-1524), but including an offshore pipeline, or an abandoned offshore facility, including any abandoned offshore pipeline, unless your liability is unlimited under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(c)).

> [88 FR 22912, Apr. 14, 2023]

        § 553.703   What is the procedure for calculating the limit of liability adjustment for inflation?

#### § § 553.703

        The procedure for calculating limit of liability adjustments for inflation is as follows:

        (a)  BOEM calculates the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit of liability was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later ( the Previous Period), to the year in which the Annual CPI-U is most recently published ( the Current Period), using the following formula: Percent change in the Annual CPI-U = [(Annual CPI-U for Current Period − Annual CPI-U for Previous Period) ÷ Annual CPI-U for Previous Period] × 100. This cumulative percent change value is rounded to one decimal place.

        (b)  (1) A cumulative increase in the Annual CPI-U equal to three percent or more constitutes a significant increase in the Consumer Price Index within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. 2704(d)(4).

        (2) Not later than every three years from the year the limit of liability was last adjusted for inflation, BOEM will evaluate whether the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since that year has reached a significance threshold of three percent or greater.

        (3) For any three-year period evaluated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in which the cumulative percent increase in the Annual CPI-U is less than three percent, if BOEM has not issued an inflation adjustment during that period, BOEM will publish a notice of no inflation adjustment to the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in the .

        (4) Once the three-percent threshold is reached, BOEM will increase by final rule the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in § 553.702 by an amount equal to the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later. After this adjustment is made, BOEM will resume its process of conducting a review every three years.

        (5) Nothing in this section will prevent BOEM, in BOEM's sole discretion, from adjusting the offshore facility limit of liability for damages for inflation by regulation issued more frequently than every three years.

        (c)  BOEM calculates adjustments to the offshore facility limit of liability in 30 CFR 553.702 for inflation using the following formula:

        § 553.704   How will BOEM publish the offshore facility limit of liability adjustment?

#### § § 553.704

        BOEM will publish the inflation-adjusted limit of liability, and any statutory amendments to that limit of liability in the  as amendments to § 553.702. Updates to the limit of liability under this section are effective on the 90th day after publication in the  of the amendments to § 553.702, unless otherwise specified by statute (in the event of a statutory amendment to the limit of liability), or in the  rule amending § 553.702.

> [81 FR 34275, May 31, 2016]

        § 556.404   What do the non-procurement debarment rules require that I do?

#### § § 556.404

        You must comply with the Department's non-procurement debarment regulations at 2 CFR parts 180 and 1400.

        (a) You must notify BOEM if you know that you or your principals are excluded, disqualified, have been convicted or are indicted of a crime as described in 2 CFR part 180, subpart C. You must make this notification before you sign a lease, sublease, or an assignment of record title interest or operating rights interest, or become a lease or unit operator. This paragraph does not apply if you have previously provided a statement disclosing this information, and you have received an exception from the Department, as described in 2 CFR 180.135 and 2 CFR 1400.137.

        (b) If you wish to enter into a covered transaction with another person at a lower tier, as described in 2 CFR 180.200, you must first:

        (1) Verify that the person is not excluded or disqualified under 2 CFR part 180; and

      Subpart E—Issuance of a Lease

        How To Bid

          § 556.500   Once qualified, how do I submit a bid?

#### § § 556.500

          (a) You must submit a separate sealed bid for each tract or bidding unit to the address provided and by the time specified in the final notice of sale. You may not bid on less than an entire tract or bidding unit.

          (b) BOEM requires a deposit for each bid. The final notice of sale will specify the amount and method of payment.

          (c) Unless otherwise specified in the final notice of sale, the bid deposit amount will be 20 percent of the amount of the bid for any given tract or bidding unit.

          (d) You may not submit a bid on an OCS tract if, after notice and hearing under section 8(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1337(d)), the Secretary finds that you are not meeting the diligence requirements on any OCS lease.

          (e) If the authorized officer within BOEM rejects your high bid, the decision is final for the Department, subject only to reconsideration upon your written request as set out in § 556.517.

          § 556.501   What information do I need to submit with my bid?

#### § § 556.501

          In accordance with OCSLA section 18(a)(4) (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)(4)), BOEM must evaluate every bid to ensure that the federal government receives fair market value for every lease. Section 26(a)(1)(A) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1352(a)(1)(A)) provides that, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any lessee or permittee conducting any exploration for, or development or production of, oil or gas must provide the Secretary access to all data and information (including processed, analyzed, and interpreted information) obtained from that activity and must provide copies of that data and information as the Secretary may request.

          (a) As part of the lease sale process, every bidder submitting a bid on a tract, or participating as a joint bidder in such a bid, may at the time of bid be required to submit various information, including a Geophysical Data and Information Statement (GDIS) corresponding to that tract, as well as the bidder's exclusive/proprietary geophysical data in order for BOEM to properly evaluate the bid. If a GDIS required, each GDIS must include, as required by § 551.12(b) and (c) of this chapter:

          (1) A list of geophysical surveys or other information used as part of the decision to bid or participate in a bid on the block.

          (2) An accurate and complete record of each geophysical survey conducted, including digital navigational data and final location maps. The bidder and any joint bidder must include a map for each survey identified in the GDIS that illustrates the actual areal extent of the proprietary geophysical data.

          (b) If a bidder is required to submit a GDIS, the GDIS must be submitted even if the bidder did not rely on proprietary geophysical data and information in deciding to bid or participate as a joint bidder in the bid for any particular block, and must include entries for all such blocks.

          (c) The bidder must submit each GDIS in a separate and sealed envelope, or in an electronically readable spreadsheet format, with proprietary seismic data maps also available in an electronic format. Each bidder must submit the GDIS even if its joint bidder or bidders on a specific block also have submitted a GDIS.

          (d) If BOEM requires additional information related to bidding, it will describe the additional information requirements in the final notice of sale.

          (e) BOEM will reimburse bidders for the costs of complying with the requirements of this section, in accordance with § 550.196 (on lease) and/or § 551.13 (off lease) of this chapter.

          (f) Bids that are not made in compliance with this section will be considered incomplete and invalid.

        Restrictions on Joint Bidding

          § 556.511   Are there restrictions on bidding with others and do those restrictions affect my ability to bid?

#### § § 556.511

          The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 6213, prohibits joint bidding by major oil and gas producers under certain circumstances. BOEM implements 42 U.S.C. 6213 as follows:

          (a) BOEM publishes twice yearly in the  a restricted joint bidders list. A person appearing on this list is limited in its ability to submit a joint bid. The list:

          (1) Consists of the persons chargeable with an average worldwide daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil and/or its equivalent in natural gas liquids and natural gas for the prior production period; and

          (2) Is based upon the statement of production that filed as required by § 556.513.

          (b) If BOEM places you on the restricted joint bidders list, BOEM will send you a copy of the order placing you on the list. You may appeal this order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590, subpart A.

          (c) If you are listed in the  in any group of restricted bidders, you may not bid:

          (1) Jointly with another person in any other group of restricted bidders for the applicable 6-month bidding period; or

          (2) Separately during the 6-month bidding period if you have an agreement with another restricted bidder that will result in joint ownership in an OCS lease.

          (d) If you are listed in the  in any group of restricted bidders, you may not make any pre-bidding agreement for the conveyance of any potential lease interest, whether by assignment, sale, transfer, or other means, to any person on the list of restricted joint bidders.

          (e) Even if you are not listed in the  in any group of restricted bidders, you are prohibited from making any pre-bidding agreement for the assignment, sale, transfer, or other conveyance of any potential lease interest to two or more persons in different groups on the list of restricted joint bidders.

          (f) As a bidder, you are prohibited from unlawful combination with, or intimidation of, bidders under 18 U.S.C. 1860.

          § 556.512   What bids may be disqualified?

#### § § 556.512

          The following bids for any oil and gas lease will be disqualified and rejected in their entirety:

          (a) A joint bid submitted by two or more persons who are on the effective List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or

          (b) A joint bid submitted by two or more persons when:

          (1) One or more of those persons is chargeable for the prior production period with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and has not filed a Statement of Production, as required by § 556.513 of this part for the applicable 6-month bidding period, or

          (2) Any of those persons have failed or refused to file a detailed report of production when required to do so under § 556.513, or

          (c) A single or joint bid submitted pursuant to an agreement (whether written or oral, formal or informal, entered into or arranged prior to or simultaneously with the submission of such single or joint bid, or prior to or simultaneously with the award of the bid upon the tract) that provides:

          (1) For the assignment, transfer, sale, or other conveyance of less than a 100 percent interest in the entire tract on which the bid is submitted, by a person or persons on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to another person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or

          (2) For the assignment, sale, transfer or other conveyance of less than a 100 percent interest in any fractional interest in the entire tract (which fractional interest was originally acquired by the person making the assignment, sale, transfer or other conveyance, under the provisions of the act) by a person or persons on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to another person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or

          (3) For the assignment, sale, transfer, or other conveyance of any interest in a tract by a person or persons not on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to two or more persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or

          (4) For any of the types of conveyances described in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section where any party to the conveyance is chargeable for the prior production period with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and has not filed a Statement of Production pursuant to § 556.513 for the applicable six-month bidding period. Assignments expressly required by law, regulation, lease or lease stipulation will not disqualify an otherwise qualified bid; or

          (d) A bid submitted by or in conjunction with a person who has filed a false, fraudulent or otherwise intentionally false or misleading detailed Report of Production.

          § 556.513   When must I file a statement of production?

#### § § 556.513

          (a) You must file a statement of production if your average worldwide daily production exceeded 1.6 million barrels for the prior production period, as determined using the method set forth in § 556.514. Your statement of production must specify that you were chargeable with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels for the prior production period.

          (b) The prior production periods are as follows:

          (c) You must file the statement of production by the following deadlines:

          (d) If you are required to file a statement of production, BOEM may require you to submit a detailed report of production.

          (1) The detailed report of production must list crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas produced worldwide from reservoirs during the prior production period, and therefore chargeable to the prior production period.

          (i) The amount of crude oil chargeable to the prior production period will be established by measurement of volumes delivered at the point of custody transfer (e.g., from storage tanks to pipelines, trucks, tankers, or other media for transport to refineries or terminals), with adjustments for net differences between opening and closing inventories, and basic sediment and water.

          (ii) The amount of natural gas liquids chargeable to the prior production period must include gas liquefied at surface separators, field facilities, or gas processing plants.

          (iii) The amount of natural gas chargeable to the prior production period must include adjustments, where applicable, to reflect the volume of gas returned to natural reservoirs, and the reduction of volume resulting from the removal of natural gas liquids and non-hydrocarbon gases.

          (2) You must submit the detailed report of production within 30 days after receiving BOEM's request.

          (3) BOEM may inspect and copy any document, record of production, analysis, and other material to verify the accuracy of any earlier statement of production.

          (e) If you submit a statement of production that misrepresents your chargeable production, the Department may cancel any lease awarded in reliance upon the statement.

          § 556.514   How do I determine my production for purposes of the restricted joint bidders list?

#### § § 556.514

          (a) To determine the amount of production chargeable to you, add together:

          (1) Your average daily production in barrels of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas worldwide, all measured at 60 °F, using the equivalency or conversion factors for natural gas liquids and natural gas set out in 42 U.S.C. 6213(b)(2) and (3); and

          (2) Your proportionate share of the average daily production owned by any person that has an interest in you and/or in which you have an interest.

          (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, your production includes 100 percent of production owned by:

          (1) You;

          (2) Every subsidiary of yours;

          (3) Every person of which you are a subsidiary; and

          (4) Every subsidiary of any person of which you are a subsidiary.

          (c) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, interest means at least a five percent ownership or control of you or the reporting person and includes any interest:

          (1) From ownership of securities or other evidence of ownership; or,

          (2) By participation in any contract, agreement, or understanding regarding control of the person or their production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, or natural gas.

          (d) For purposes of this section, subsidiary means a person, 50 percent or more of whose stock or other interest having power to vote for the election of a controlling body, such as directors or trustees, is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another person.

          (e) For purposes of this section, production chargeable to you includes, but is not limited to, production obtained as a result of a production payment or a working, net profit, royalty, overriding royalty, or carried interest.

          (f) For purposes of this section, production must be measured with appropriate adjustments for:

          (1) Basic sediment and water;

          (2) Removal of natural gas liquids and non-hydrocarbon gases; and

          (3) Volume of gas returned to natural reservoirs.

          § 556.515   May a person be exempted from joint bidding restrictions?

#### § § 556.515

          BOEM may exempt you from some or all of the reporting requirements listed in § 556.513, and/or some or all of the joint bidding restrictions listed in §§ 556.511 and/or 556.512(a), (b), and/or (c), if, after opportunity for a hearing, BOEM determines that the extremely high costs in an area will preclude exploration and development without an exemption.

        How Does BOEM Act on Bids?

          § 556.516   What does BOEM do with my bid?

#### § § 556.516

          (a) BOEM opens the sealed bids at the place, date, and hour specified in the final notice of sale for the sole purpose of publicly announcing and recording the bids. BOEM does not accept or reject any bids at that time.

          (b) BOEM reserves the right to reject any and all bids received, regardless of the amount offered. BOEM accepts or rejects all bids within 90 days of opening. BOEM reserves the right to extend that time if necessary, and in that event, BOEM will notify bidder(s) in writing prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day period, or of any extension. Any bid not accepted within the prescribed 90-day period, or any extension thereof, will be deemed rejected. If your bid is rejected, BOEM will refund any money deposited with your bid, plus any interest accrued.

          (c) If the highest bids are a tie, BOEM will notify the bidders who submitted the tie bids. Within 15 days after notification, those bidders, if qualified, and not otherwise prohibited from bidding together, may:

          (2) Agree between/among themselves which bidder will accept the lease. The bidders must notify BOEM of their decision.

          (d) If no agreement is submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, BOEM will reject all the tie bids.

          § 556.517   What may I do if my high bid is rejected?

#### § § 556.517

          (a) The decision of the authorized officer on bids is the final action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration of the rejection of the high bid by the Director, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

          (b) Within 15 days of bid rejection, you may file a written request for reconsideration with the Director, with a copy to the authorized officer. Such request must provide evidence as to why the Director should reconsider your bid. You will receive a written response either affirming or reversing the rejection of your bid.

          (c) The Director's decision on the request for reconsideration is not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals in the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

          (c) If you do not make the required payments and execute and return all copies of the lease and any required bond within 11 business days after receipt, or if you otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, your deposit will be forfeited. However, BOEM will return any deposit with interest if the tract is withdrawn from leasing before you execute the lease.

          (d) If you use an agent to execute the lease, you must include evidence with the executed copies of the lease that a person who is on the list of persons referenced in § 556.402(c)(3) authorized the agent to act for you.

          (e) After you comply with all requirements in this section, and after BOEM has executed the lease, BOEM will send you a fully executed lease.

          (2) A sublease of operating rights from record title may be for a whole or undivided fractional interest in the entire lease or a described aliquot portion of the lease and/or a depth interval. The sublease creates an operating rights interest in the sublessee, herein referred to as the operating rights owner.

          (c) Within any given aliquot, the record title owner may sublease operating rights for up to a maximum of two depth divisions, which may result in a maximum of three different depth intervals. But, if the one, or two, depth divisions to which operating rights are subleased do not include the entire depth of the lease, whatever depth division(s) has not been subleased, remains part of the lessee/sublessor's record title interest. The depth intervals for which operating rights are subleased must be defined by a beginning and ending depth and the ending of one depth level must abut the beginning of the next depth level, with no gap in between.

          (d) Every current and prior record title owner is jointly and severally liable, along with all other record title owners and all prior and current operating rights owners, for compliance with all non-monetary terms and conditions of the lease and all regulations issued under OCSLA, as well as for fulfilling all non-monetary obligations, including decommissioning obligations, which accrue while it holds record title interest.

          (e) Record title owners that acquired their record title interests through assignment from a prior record title owner are also responsible for remedying all existing environmental or operational problems on any lease in which they own record title interests, with subrogation rights against prior lessees.

          (f) For monetary obligations, your obligation depends on the source of the monetary obligation and whether you have retained or severed your operating rights.

          (1) With respect to those operating rights that you have retained, you are primarily liable under 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) for your pro-rata share of all other monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to the operating rights you have retained, based on your share of operating rights in that portion of the lease.

          (2) With respect to all monetary obligations arising from or in connection with those operating rights that have been severed from your record title interest, your obligation is secondary to that of the sublessee(s) or later assignee(s) of the operating rights that were severed from your record title interest, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a).

          § 556.605   What are my rights and obligations as an operating rights owner?

#### § § 556.605

          (a) As an operating rights owner, you have the right to enter the leased area to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas resources, except helium gas, contained within the aliquot(s) and depths within which you own operating rights, according to the lease terms, applicable regulations, and BOEM's approval of the sublease or subsequent assignment of the operating rights.

          (b) Unless otherwise prohibited, you have the right to authorize another party to conduct operations on the part of the lease to which your operating rights appertain.

          (c) An owner of operating rights who is designating a new designated operator must file a designation of operator under § 550.143 of this chapter.

          (d) An operating rights owner is only liable for obligations arising from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain and that accrue during the period in which the operating rights owner owned the operating rights.

          (e) You are jointly and severally liable with other operating rights owners and the record title owners for all non-monetary lease obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, which accrued during the time you held your operating rights interest.

          (f) An operating rights owner that acquires its operating rights interests through assignment from a prior operating rights owner is also responsible, with subrogation rights against prior operating rights owners, for remedying existing environmental or operational problems, to the extent that such problems arise from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain, on any lease in which it owns operating rights.

          (g) You are primarily liable for monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, and the record title owners are secondarily liable. If there is more than one operating rights owner in a lease, each operating rights owner is primarily liable for its pro-rata share of the monetary obligations that pertain to the portion of the lease that is subject to its operating rights.

        Helium

          § 556.606   What must a lessee do if BOEM elects to extract helium from a lease?

#### § § 556.606

          (a) BOEM reserves the ownership of, and the right to extract, helium from all gas produced from your OCS lease. Under section 12(f) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1341(f)), upon our request, you must deliver all or a specified portion of the gas containing helium to BOEM at a point on the leased area or at an onshore processing facility that BOEM designates.

          (b) BOEM will determine reasonable compensation and pay you for any loss caused by the extraction of helium, except for the value of the helium itself. BOEM may erect, maintain, and operate on your lease any reduction work and other equipment necessary for helium extraction. Our extraction of helium will be conducted in a manner to not cause substantial delays in the delivery of gas to your purchaser.

      Subpart G—Transferring All or Part of the Record Title Interest in a Lease

        § 556.700   May I assign or sublease all or any part of the record title interest in my lease?

#### § § 556.700

        (a) With BOEM approval, you may assign your whole, or a partial record title interest in your entire lease, or in any aliquot(s) thereof.

        (b) With BOEM approval, you may sever all, or a portion of, your operating rights.

        (c) You must request approval of each assignment of a record title interest and each sublease of an operating rights interest. Each instrument that transfers a record title interest must describe, by aliquot parts, the interest you propose to transfer. Each instrument that severs an operating rights interest must describe, by officially designated aliquot parts and depth levels, the interest proposed to be transferred.

        § 556.701   How do I seek approval of an assignment of the record title interest in my lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest?

#### § § 556.701

        (a) The Regional Director will provide the form to record an assignment of record title interest in a Federal OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest. You must submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of record title within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. You must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your request and your submission must include evidence of payment via

        (b) Before BOEM approves an assignment or transfer, it must consult with, and consider the views of, the Attorney General. The Secretary may act on an assignment or transfer if the Attorney General has not responded to a request for consultation within 30 days of said request.

        (c) A new record title owner or sublessee must file a designation of operator, in accordance with § 550.143 of this chapter, along with the request for the approval of the assignment.

        § 556.702   When will my assignment result in a segregated lease?

#### § § 556.702

        (a) When there is an assignment by all record title owners of 100 percent of the record title to one or more aliquots in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such case, both the new lease and the remaining portion of the original lease are referred to as “segregated leases” and the assignee(s) becomes the record title owner(s) of the new lease, which is subject to all the terms and conditions of the original lease.

        (b) If a record title holder transfers an undivided interest,  less than 100 percent of the record title interest in any given aliquot(s), that transfer will not segregate the portions of the aliquots, or the whole aliquots, in which part of the record title was transferred, into separate leases from the portion(s) in which no interest was transferred. Instead, that transfer will create a joint ownership between the assignee(s) and assignor(s) in the portions of the lease in which part of the record title interest was transferred. Any transfer of an undivided interest is subject to approval by BOEM.

        § 556.703   What is the effect of the approval of the assignment of 100 percent of the record title in a particular aliquot(s) of my lease and of the resulting lease segregation?

#### § § 556.703

        (a) The financial assurance requirements of subpart I of this part apply separately to each segregated lease.

        (b) The royalty, minimum royalty, and rental provisions of the original lease will apply separately to each segregated lease.

        (c) BOEM will allocate among the segregated leases, on a basis that is equitable under the circumstances, any remaining unused royalty suspension volume or other form of royalty suspension or royalty relief that had been granted to the original lease, not to exceed in aggregate the total remaining amount.

        (d) Each segregated lease will continue in full force and effect for the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter as each segregated lease meets the requirements outlined in § 556.601. A segregated lease that does not meet the requirements of § 556.601 does not continue in force even if another segregated lease, which was part of the original lease, continues to meet those requirements.

        (2) When a transferor attempts a transfer that is not acceptable as to form or content ( not on standard form, containing incorrect legal description, not executed by a person authorized to bind the corporation, transferee does not meet the requirements of § 556.401); or

        (3) When the transfer does not conform to these regulations, or any other applicable laws or regulations (e.g., departmental debarment rules).

        (b) A transfer will be void if it is made pursuant to any prelease agreement that would cause a bid to be disqualified, such as those described in § 556.511(c), (d), or (e).

        You may transfer your record title interest in one lease to multiple parties using the same instrument. That instrument must be submitted in duplicate originals, accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof). In such a multiple transfer of interests using a single instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest, and evidence of payment via  must accompany the instrument.

        § 556.710   What is the effect of an assignment of a lease on an assignor's liability under the lease?

#### § § 556.710

        If you assign your record title interest, as an assignor you remain liable for all obligations, monetary and non-monetary, that accrued in connection with your lease during the period in which you owned the record title interest, up to the date BOEM approves your assignment. BOEM's approval of the assignment does not relieve you of these accrued obligations. Even after assignment, BOEM or BSEE may require you to bring the lease into compliance if your assignee or any subsequent assignee fails to perform any obligation under the lease, to the extent the obligation accrued before approval of your assignment. Until there is a BOEM-approved assignment of interest, you, as the assignor, remain liable for the performance of all lease obligations that accrued while you held record title interest, until all such obligations are fulfilled.

        § 556.711   What is the effect of a record title holder's sublease of operating rights on the record title holder's liability?

#### § § 556.711

        (a) A record title holder who subleases operating rights remains liable for all obligations of the lease, including those obligations accruing after BOEM's approval of the sublease, subject to § 556.604(e) and (f).

        (b) Neither the sublease of operating rights, nor subsequent assignment of those rights by the original sublessee, nor by any subsequent assignee of the operating rights, alters in any manner the liability of the record title holder for nonmonetary obligations.

        (c) Upon approval of the sublease of the operating rights, the sublessee and subsequent assignees of the operating rights become primarily liable for monetary obligations, but the record title holder remains secondarily liable for them, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) and § 556.604(f)(2).

        § 556.712   What is the effective date of a transfer?

#### § § 556.712

        Any transfer is effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month following the date on which BOEM approves your request, unless you request an earlier effective date and BOEM approves that earlier date, but such earlier effective date, if prior to the date of BOEM's approval, does not relieve you of obligations accrued between that earlier effective date and the date of approval.

        § 556.713   What is the effect of an assignment of a lease on an assignee's liability under the lease?

#### § § 556.713

        (b) Such description of the timing and nature of the transfer agreement must be submitted together with a certified statement that attests to the truth and accuracy of any information reported concerning that agreement, subject to the penalties of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

        (c) If you wish to transfer less than your entire interest to another restricted joint bidder, BOEM may request the opinion of the Attorney General before acting on your request.

        (d) You may request that any submission to BOEM made pursuant to this part be treated confidentially. Please note such a request on your submission. BOEM will treat this request for confidentiality in accordance with the regulations at § 556.104 and the regulations at 43 CFR part 2.

        (b) In all cases other than that in paragraph (a) of this section, you must submit new designation of operator forms in accordance with § 550.143 of this chapter. In the event that you are transferring multiple record title interests, you must comply with this requirement for each interest that does not fall within paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 556.900   Financial assurance requirements for an oil and gas or sulfur lease.

#### § § 556.900

        This section establishes financial assurance requirements for the lessee of an OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease.

        (a) Before BOEM will issue a new lease to you as the lessee, you or another lessee for the lease must comply with one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. Before BOEM will approve the assignment of a record title interest in an existing lease to you as the lessee, you or another lessee for the lease must provide any supplemental financial assurance required by the Regional Director and also comply with one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3).

        (1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or

        (2) Maintain a $300,000 area-wide bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulfur leases in the area where the lease is located; or

        (3) Maintain a lease or area-wide bond in the amount required in § 556.901(a) or (b).

        (b) For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The three areas are:

        (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and

        (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.

        (c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security instrument) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 556.901(a) and (b) may be satisfied if your operator or an operating rights owner provides a lease bond in the required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease. Your operator or an operating rights owner may use an areawide bond under this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.

        (d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.

        (e) If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is reduced because of a default or for any other reason, you must provide additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the Regional Director may direct.

        (f) You may pledge United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they replace.

        (1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the required amount.

        (2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds in the event that the Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease obligation.

        (g) You may provide alternative types of financial assurance instead of providing a surety bond if the Regional Director determines that the alternative financial assurance protects the interests of the United States to the same extent as a surety bond.

        (1) If you pledge an alternative type of security under this paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the required amount.

        (2) If you pledge an alternative type of security, you must include authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to satisfy any lease obligation.

        (h) If you fail to replace deficient financial assurance or to provide supplemental financial assurance upon demand, the Regional Director may:

        (1) Assess penalties under part 550, subpart N of this subchapter;

        (2) Request BSEE to suspend production and other operations on your lease in accordance with § 250.173 of this title; and/or

        (3) Initiate action to cancel your lease.

        (i) In the event you amend your area-wide surety bond covering lease obligations, or obtain a new area-wide lease surety bond, to cover the financial assurance requirements for any RUE(s), your area-wide lease surety bond may be called in whole or in part to cover any or all the obligations on which you default that are associated with your RUE(s) located in the area covered by such area-wide lease surety bond.

        § 556.901   Base and supplemental financial assurance.

#### § § 556.901

        (a) You must provide the following financial assurance before commencing any lease exploration activities.

        (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director $200,000 in lease exploration financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:

        (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $200,000 lease exploration bond after you submit an EP, but before approval of drilling activities under the EP.

        (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph (a) by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.

        (2) A $200,000 lease exploration bond pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section need not be submitted and maintained if the lessee either:

        (i) Furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $1 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases held by the lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is situated; or

        (ii) Furnishes and maintains a bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (b) This paragraph (b) explains what financial assurance you must provide before lease development and production activities commence.

        (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director $500,000 in lease development financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:

        (A) The date you submit a proposed development and production plan (DPP) or development operations coordination document (DOCD) for approval; or

        (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of a lease on which a DPP or DOCD has been approved.

        (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $500,000 lease development bond after you submit a DPP or DOCD, but before he/she approves the installation of a platform or the commencement of drilling activities under the DPP or DOCD.

        (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.

        (2) You need not submit and maintain a $500,000 lease development bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section if you furnish and maintain an areawide bond in the sum of $3 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases you hold on the OCS for the area in which the lease is located.

        (c) If you can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that you can satisfy your decommissioning and other lease obligations for less than the amount of financial assurance required under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Director may accept financial assurance in an amount less than the prescribed amount but not less than the amount of the cost for decommissioning.

        (d) The Regional Director may determine that supplemental financial assurance ( financial assurance above the amounts prescribed in §§ 550.166(a) and 550.1011(a) of this subchapter, § 556.900(a), or paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) is required to ensure compliance with your lease obligations, including decommissioning obligations; the regulations in this chapter; and the regulations in chapters II and XII of this title. The Regional Director may require you to provide supplemental financial assurance if you do not meet at least one of the following criteria:

        (1) You have an investment grade credit rating. If any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is defined in section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provides a credit rating for you that differs from that of any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization, BOEM will apply the highest rating for purposes of determining your financial assurance requirements.

        (2) You have a proxy credit rating determined by the Regional Director that they determine reflects creditworthiness equivalent to an investment grade credit rating, which must be based on audited financial information for the most recent fiscal year (which must include an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the auditor's certificate).

        (i) The audited financial information for your most recent fiscal year must cover a continuous twelve-month period within the twenty-four-month period prior to your receipt of the Regional Director's determination that you must provide supplemental financial assurance.

        (ii) In determining your proxy credit rating, the Regional Director may include the total value of the offshore decommissioning liabilities associated with any lease(s) or grants in which you have an ownership interest. Upon the request of the Regional Director, you must provide the information that the Regional Director determines is necessary to properly evaluate the total value of your offshore decommissioning liabilities, including joint ownership interests and liabilities associated with your OCS leases and grants.

        (3) Your co-lessee or co-grant holder has an issuer credit rating or proxy credit rating that meets the criterion set forth in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. However, the presence of such co-lessee or co-grant holder will allow the Regional Director to not require financial assurance from you only to the extent that you and that co-lessee or co-grant holder share accrued liabilities, and the Regional Director may require you to provide supplemental financial assurance for decommissioning obligations for which such co-lessee or co-grant holder is not liable.

        (4) There are proved oil and gas reserves on the lease, unit, or field, as defined by the SEC Regulation S-X at 17 CFR 210.4-10 and SEC Regulation S-K at 17 CFR 229.1200, the discounted value of which exceeds three times the estimated undiscounted cost of the decommissioning associated with the production of those reserves, and that value must be based on proved reserve reports submitted to the Regional Director and reported on a per-lease, unit, or field basis. BOEM will determine the decommissioning costs associated with the production of your reserves, and will use the following undiscounted decommissioning cost estimates:

        (i) Where BSEE-generated probabilistic estimates are available, BOEM will use the estimate at the level at which there is a 70 percent probability that the actual cost of decommissioning will be less than the estimate (P70).

        (ii) If there is no BSEE probabilistic estimate available, BOEM will use the BSEE-generated deterministic estimate.

        (e) You may satisfy the Regional Director's demand for supplemental financial assurance by increasing the amount of your existing financial assurance or providing additional surety bonds or other types of acceptable financial assurance.

        (f) The Regional Director will use the BSEE P70 decommissioning probabilistic estimate to determine the amount of supplemental financial assurance required to guarantee compliance when there is no lessee or co-lessee that meets the criterion in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. In making this determination, the Regional Director will also consider your potential underpayment of royalty and cumulative decommissioning obligations. Note that BOEM will use these P-values only in the context of determining how much financial assurance is required, and not in the context of bond forfeiture. Regardless of whether you are required to provide supplemental financial assurance at the P70 level, you remain liable for the full costs of decommissioning, and your surety remains liable for the full amount of decommissioning up to the limit of assurance provided.

        (g) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of supplemental financial assurance required.

        (1) If the Regional Director proposes an adjustment, the Regional Director will:

        (i) Notify you and your financial assurance provider of any proposed adjustment to the amount of financial assurance required; and

        (ii) Give you an opportunity to submit written or oral comment on the adjustment.

        (2) If you request a reduction of the amount of supplemental financial assurance required, or oppose the amount of a proposed adjustment, you must submit evidence to the Regional Director demonstrating that the projected amount of royalties due to the United States Government and the estimated costs of decommissioning are less than the required financial assurance amount. Upon review of your submission, the Regional Director may reduce the amount of financial assurance required.

        (h) During the first 3 years from June 24, 2024, you may, upon receipt of a demand letter for supplemental financial assurance under this section, request that the Regional Director allow you to provide, in three equal installments payable according to the schedule provided under this paragraph (h), the full amount of supplemental financial assurance required.

        (1) If the Regional Director allows you to provide the amount required on such a phased basis, you must comply with the following:

        (i) You must provide the initial one-third of the total supplemental financial assurance required within the timeframe specified in the demand letter or, if no timeframe is specified, within 60 calendar days of the date of receipt of the demand letter.

        (ii) You must provide the second one-third of the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM within 24 months of the date of receipt of the demand letter.

        (iii) You must provide the final one-third of the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM within 36 months of the date of receipt of the demand letter.

        (2) If the Regional Director allows you to meet your supplemental financial assurance requirement in a phased manner, as set forth in this section, and you fail to timely provide the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM, the Regional Director will notify you of such failure. You will no longer be eligible to meet your supplemental financial assurance requirement in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (h), and the remaining amount due will become due 10 calendar days after such notification is received.

        § 556.902   General requirements for bonds or other financial assurance.

#### § § 556.902

        (a) Any surety bond or other financial assurance that you, as record title owner, operating rights owner, grant holder, or operator, provide under this part, or under part 550 of this subchapter, must:

        (1) Be payable upon demand to the Regional Director;

        (2) Guarantee compliance with all your obligations under the lease or grant, the regulations in chapters II and XII of this title, and all BOEM and BSEE orders; and

        (3) Except as stated in § 556.905(b), guarantee compliance with the obligations of all record title owners, operating rights owners, and operators on the lease, and all grant-holders on a grant.

        (b) All bonds and pledges you furnish under this part must be on a form or in a form approved by the Director. Surety bonds must be issued by a surety that the Treasury certifies as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and that is listed in the current Treasury Circular No. 570. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular No. 570 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

        (c) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When either party is a corporation, an authorized official for the party must sign the bond and attest to it by an imprint of the corporate seal.

        (d) Bonds must be non-cancellable, except as provided in § 556.906 of this part. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event occurs that could diminish, terminate, or cancel a surety obligation under State surety law.

        (e) Lease bonds must be:

        (1) A surety bond;

        (2) A pledge of Treasury securities, as provided in § 556.900(f);

        (3) Another form of security approved by the Regional Director; or

        (4) A combination of these security methods.

        (f) You may submit a bond to the Regional Director executed on a form approved under paragraph (b) of this section that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If you do, and if the document omits terms or conditions contained on the form approved by the Director, the bond you submit will be deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.

        (g) If you believe that BOEM's supplemental financial assurance demand is unjustified, you may request an informal resolution of your dispute in accordance with the requirements of § 590.6 of this chapter. Your request for an informal resolution will not affect your right to request to meet your supplemental financial assurance requirement in a phased manner under § 556.901(h).

        (h) You may file an appeal of a supplemental financial assurance demand with the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) pursuant to the regulations in part 590 of this chapter. However, if you request that the IBLA stay the demand pending a final ruling on your appeal, you must post an appeal surety bond equal to the amount of the demand that you seek to stay before any such stay is effective.

#### § § 556.903

        (a) If your surety, guarantor, or the financial institution holding or providing your financial assurance becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has its charter or license suspended or revoked, any financial assurance coverage from such surety, guarantor, or financial institution must be replaced. You must notify the Regional Director within 72 hours of learning of such event, and, within 30 calendar days of learning of such event, you must provide other financial assurance from a different financial assurance provider in the amount required under §§ 556.900 and 556.901, or § 550.166 of this subchapter, or § 550.1011 of this subchapter.

        (b) You must notify the Regional Director within 72 hours of learning of any action filed alleging that you are insolvent or bankrupt or that your surety, guarantor, or financial institution is insolvent or bankrupt or has had its charter or license suspended or revoked. All surety bonds or other financial assurance instruments must require the surety, guarantor, or financial institution to timely provide this required notification both to you and directly to BOEM.

        § 556.904   Decommissioning accounts.

#### § § 556.904

        (a) The Regional Director may authorize you to establish a decommissioning account(s) in a federally insured financial institution to satisfy a supplemental financial assurance demand made pursuant to § 556.901(d), § 550.166(b) of this subchapter, or § 550.1011(d) of this subchapter. The decommissioning account must be set up in such a manner that funds may not be withdrawn without the written approval of the Regional Director.

        (1) Funds in the account must be used only to meet your decommissioning obligations and must be payable upon demand to BOEM.

        (2) You must fully fund the account to cover all decommissioning costs as estimated by BSEE, to the amount, and pursuant to the schedule, that the Regional Director prescribes.

        (3) If you fail to make the initial payment or any scheduled payment into the decommissioning account and you fail to correct a missed payment within 30 days, you must immediately submit, and subsequently maintain, a surety bond or other financial assurance in an amount equal to the remaining unfulfilled portion of the supplemental financial assurance demand.

        (b) Any interest paid on funds in a decommissioning account will become part of the principal funds in the account unless the Regional Director authorizes in writing the payment of the interest to the party who deposits the funds.

        (c) The Regional Director may authorize or require you to create an overriding royalty, production payment obligation, or other revenue stream for the benefit of an account established as financial assurance for the decommissioning of your lease(s) or RUE or pipeline ROW grant(s). The obligation may be associated with oil and gas or sulfur production from a lease other than a lease or grant secured through the decommissioning account.

        (d) BOEM may provide funds from the decommissioning account to the party that performs the decommissioning in response to a BOEM or BSEE order to perform such decommissioning or to cover the costs thereof. BOEM will distribute the funds from the decommissioning account upon presentation of paid invoices for reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the party performing the decommissioning.

        § 556.905   Third-party guarantees.

#### § § 556.905

        (a) The Regional Director may accept a third-party guarantee to satisfy a supplemental financial assurance demand made pursuant to § 556.901(d), § 550.166(b) of this subchapter, or § 550.1011(d) of this subchapter, if:

        (1) The guarantor meets the credit rating or proxy credit rating criterion set forth in § 556.901(d)(1) or (2), as applicable; and

        (2) The guarantor or guaranteed party submits a third-party guarantee agreement containing each of the provisions in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) Notwithstanding § 556.902(a)(3), a third-party guarantor may, as agreed to by BOEM at the time the third-party guarantee is provided, limit its cumulative obligations to a fixed dollar amount or limit its obligations so as to cover the performance of one or more specific lease obligations (with no fixed dollar amount).

        (c) If, during the life of your third-party guarantee, your guarantor no longer meets the criterion referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must, within 72 hours of so learning:

        (1) Notify the Regional Director; and

        (2) Submit, and subsequently maintain, a surety bond or other financial assurance covering those obligations previously secured by the third-party guarantee.

        (d) Your third-party guarantee must contain each of the following provisions:

        (1) If you fail to comply with the terms of any lease or grant covered by the guarantee, or any applicable regulation, your guarantor must either:

        (i) Take corrective action to bring the lease or grant into compliance with its terms or any applicable regulation, to the extent covered by the guarantee; or

        (ii) Be liable under the third-party guarantee agreement to provide, within 7 calendar days, sufficient funds for the Regional Director to complete such corrective action to the extent covered by the guarantee. Such payment does not result in the cancellation of the guarantee, but instead reduces the remaining value of the guarantee in an amount equal to the payment.

        (2) If your guarantor wishes to terminate the period of liability under its guarantee, it must:

        (i) Notify you and the Regional Director at least 90 calendar days before the proposed termination date;

        (ii) Obtain the Regional Director's approval for the termination of the period of liability for all or a specified portion of the guarantee; and

        (iii) Remain liable for all liabilities that accrued or began accruing prior to the termination and responsible for all work and workmanship performed during the period of liability.

        (3) Before the termination of the period of liability of the third-party guarantee, you must provide acceptable replacement financial assurance.

        (e) If you or your guarantor request BOEM to cancel your third-party guarantee, BOEM will cancel the guarantee under the same terms and conditions provided for cancellation of supplemental financial assurance and return of pledged financial assurance in § 556.906(b) and/or (d)(3).

        (f) The guarantor or guaranteed party must submit a third-party guarantee agreement that meets the following criteria:

        (1) The third-party guarantee agreement must be executed by your guarantor and all persons and parties bound by the agreement.

        (2) The third-party guarantee agreement must bind, jointly and severally, each person and party executing the agreement.

        (3) When your guarantor is a corporate entity, two corporate officers who are authorized to bind the corporation must sign the third-party guarantee agreement.

        (g) Your corporate guarantor and any other corporate entities bound by the third-party guarantee agreement must provide the Regional Director copies of:

        (1) The authorization of the signatory corporate officials to bind their respective corporations;

        (2) An affidavit certifying that the agreement is valid under all applicable laws; and

        (3) Each corporation's corporate authorization to enter into the third-party guarantee agreement.

        (h) If your third-party guarantor or another party bound by the third-party guarantee agreement is a partnership, joint venture, or syndicate, the third-party guarantee agreement must:

        (1) Bind each partner or party who has a beneficial interest in your guarantor; and

        (2) Provide that each member of the partnership, joint venture, or syndicate is jointly and severally liable for the obligations secured by the guarantee.

        (i) The third-party guarantee agreement must provide that, in the event forfeiture is called for under § 556.907, your guarantor will either:

        (1) Take corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance with its terms, and the regulations, to the extent covered by the guarantee; or

        (2) Provide sufficient funds within 7 calendar days to permit the Regional Director to complete such corrective action to the extent covered by the guarantee.

        (j) The third-party guarantee agreement must contain a confession of judgment. It must provide that, if the Regional Director determines that you are in default of the lease or grant covered by the guarantee or not in compliance with any regulation applicable to such lease or grant, the guarantor:

        (1) Will not challenge the determination; and

        (2) Will remedy the default to the extent covered by the guarantee.

        (k) Each third-party guarantee agreement is deemed to contain all terms and conditions contained in paragraphs (d), (i), and (j) of this section, even if the guarantor has omitted these terms from the third-party guarantee agreement.

        § 556.906   Termination of the period of liability and cancellation of financial assurance.

#### § § 556.906

        This section defines the terms and conditions under which BOEM will terminate the period of liability of, or cancel, financial assurance. Terminating the period of liability ends the period during which obligations continue to accrue, but does not relieve the financial assurance provider of the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of liability. Canceling a financial assurance instrument relieves the financial assurance provider of all liability. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include obligations that started to accrue prior to the beginning of the period of liability and had not been met, and obligations that begin accruing during the period of liability.

        (a) When you or your financial assurance provider request termination:

        (1) The Regional Director will terminate the period of liability under your financial assurance within 90 calendar days after BOEM receives the request; and

        (2) If you intend to continue operations, or have not met all decommissioning obligations, within 90 calendar days after BOEM receives your termination request, you must provide replacement financial assurance of an equivalent amount.

        (b) If you provide replacement financial assurance, the Regional Director will cancel your previous financial assurance and the previous financial assurance provider will not retain any liability, provided that:

        (1) The amount of the new financial assurance is equal to or greater than that of the financial assurance that was cancelled, or you provide an alternative form of financial assurance, and the Regional Director determines that the alternative form of financial assurance provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided by the financial assurance that is proposed to be cancelled;

        (2) For financial assurance submitted under § 556.900(a), § 556.901(a) or (b), § 550.166(a) of this subchapter, or § 550.1011(a) of this subchapter, the new financial assurance provider agrees to assume all outstanding obligations that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and

        (3) For supplemental financial assurance submitted under § 556.901(d), § 550.166(b) of this subchapter, or § 550.1011(d) of this subchapter, the new financial assurance provider agrees to assume that portion of the outstanding obligations that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated and that the Regional Director determines may exceed the coverage of the financial assurance submitted under § 556.900(a), § 556.901(a) or (b), § 550.166(a) of this subchapter, or § 550.1011(a) of this subchapter. The Regional Director will notify the provider of the new financial assurance of the amount required.

        (c) This paragraph (c) applies if the period of liability is terminated, but the financial assurance is not replaced with financial assurance of an equivalent amount pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The financial assurance provider will continue to be responsible for obligations that accrued prior to the termination of the period of liability:

        (1) Until the obligations are satisfied; and

        (2) For additional periods of time in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d) BOEM will cancel the financial assurance for your lease or grant, and the Regional Director will return any pledged financial assurance, as shown in the following table:

        (e) For all financial assurance, the Regional Director may reinstate your financial assurance as if no cancellation had occurred if:

        (1) A person makes a payment under the lease, RUE grant, or pipeline ROW grant, and the payment is rescinded or must be returned by the recipient because the person making the payment is insolvent, bankrupt, subject to reorganization, or placed in receivership; or

        (2) The responsible party represents to BOEM that it has discharged its obligations under the lease, RUE grant, or pipeline ROW grant and the representation was materially false when the financial assurance was cancelled.

        § 556.907   Forfeiture of bonds or other financial assurance.

#### § § 556.907

        This section explains how a bond or other financial assurance may be forfeited.

        (a) The Regional Director will call for forfeiture of all or part of the bond, or other form of financial assurance, including a guarantee you provide under this part, if:

        (1) You, or any party with the obligation to comply, refuse to comply with any term or condition of your lease, RUE grant, pipeline ROW grant, or any BOEM or BSEE order, or any applicable regulation, or the Regional Director determines that you are unable to so comply; or

        (2) You default on one of the conditions under which the Regional Director accepts your bond, third-party guarantee, and/or other form of financial assurance.

        (b) The Regional Director may pursue forfeiture of your surety bond or other financial assurance without first making demands for performance against any other record title owner, operating rights owner, grant holder, or other person authorized to perform lease or grant obligations.

        (c) The Regional Director will:

        (1) Notify you, your surety, guarantor, or the financial institution holding or providing your financial assurance, of a determination to call for forfeiture of your financial assurance, whether it takes the form of a surety bond, guarantee, funds, or other type of financial assurance.

        (i) This notice will be in writing and will provide the reason for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited.

        (ii) The Regional Director will determine the amount to be forfeited based upon an estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance, subject, in the case of a guarantee, to any limitation in the guarantee authorized by § 556.905(b).

        (2) Advise you and your financial assurance provider that forfeiture may be avoided if, within five business days:

        (i) You agree to and demonstrate that you will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes; or

        (ii) The provider of your financial assurance agrees to and demonstrates that it will complete the corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the amount of that financial assurance.

        (b) The deadline for applying for such a bonus or royalty credit was October 14, 2010; therefore, lessees may no longer apply for such credits.

      Subpart K—Ending a Lease

        § 556.1100   How does a lease expire?

#### § § 556.1100

        (a) Your oil and gas lease will automatically expire at the end of its primary term unless you have taken action, as set forth in § 556.601, to maintain the lease beyond the primary term.

        (b) Your sulfur lease will automatically expire at the end of its primary term unless you have taken action, as set forth in § 556.603, to maintain the lease beyond the primary term.

        § 556.1101   May I relinquish my lease or an aliquot part thereof?

#### § § 556.1101

        (a) A record title owner may relinquish a lease or an aliquot part of a lease if all record title owners of a lease or any aliquot part(s) of the lease file three original copies of a request to relinquish with BOEM on Form BOEM-0152, entitled, “Relinquishment of Federal Oil and Gas Lease.” No filing fee is required.

        (b) A relinquishment will be subject to the continued obligation of the record title owner and the surety to make all payments due, including any accrued rentals, royalties and deferred bonuses, and to abandon all wells and condition or remove all platforms and other facilities on the land to be relinquished to the satisfaction of the Director.

        (c) The effective date of the relinquishment is the date on which the relinquishment is filed with the proper BOEM regional office.

        § 556.1102   Under what circumstances will BOEM cancel my lease?

#### § § 556.1102

        (a) BOEM may cancel your non-producing lease if you fail to comply with any provision of OCSLA, the lease, or applicable regulations if the failure continues for 30 days after mailing of notice to your post office address of record by registered mail and you have not requested and been granted any additional time within which to correct the failure. Such cancellation is subject to judicial review under section 23 of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1349).

        (b) Your producing lease may be cancelled if you fail to comply with any provision of OCSLA, the lease, or applicable regulations. The Secretary will cancel a producing lease after the judicial proceedings required under section 5(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(d)).

        (c) BOEM may cancel your lease if it determines that the lease was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. You will have notice and an opportunity to be heard before BOEM cancels your lease.

        (d) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time if it determines, after a hearing, that continued activity will probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral, national security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment; that the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of time; and the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease.

        (e) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time after operations under the lease have been suspended or temporarily prohibited by the Department continuously for a period of five years pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, absent your request for a shorter period.

        (f) If, upon demand, you fail to provide a bond, or alternative type of security instrument acceptable to BOEM, the Regional Director may assess penalties or cancel your lease in accordance with part 550, subpart N of this chapter;

        (g) Title 30, part 550, subpart A of the CFR provides the procedures for lease cancellation and compensation, if applicable.

      Subpart L—Leases Maintained Under Section 6 of OCSLA

        § 556.1200   Effect of regulations on lease.

#### § § 556.1200

        (a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, will supersede the provisions of any lease that is maintained under section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a)(8) and (9) of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) will continue in effect, and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, will take precedence over these regulations.

        (b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act is also subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological exploratory operations and to pipeline ROW(s) are applicable, to the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent with the lease provisions relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties and term. The lessee must comply with any provision of the lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the regulations in this part.

        § 556.1201   Section 6(a) leases and leases other than those for oil, gas, or sulfur.

#### § § 556.1201

        The existence of an oil and gas lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act precludes only the issuance in the same area of an oil and gas lease under OCSLA, but does not preclude the issuance of other types of leases under OCSLA. However, no other lease may authorize or permit the lessee thereunder unreasonably to interfere with or endanger operations under the existing lease. The United States will not grant any sulfur leases on any area that is included in a lease covering sulfur under section 6(b) of the Act.

      Subpart M—Environmental Studies

        § 556.1300   Environmental studies.

#### § § 556.1300

        (a) The Director will conduct a study or studies of any area or region included in any oil and gas lease sale or other lease in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas or other mineral activities in such area or region. The purposes of such studies will include, to the extent practicable, analyses of the impacts of pollutants introduced into the environments and impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and affected coastal areas.

        (b) Studies will be planned and carried out in cooperation with the affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, will not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, the Director will, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in executing its environmental studies responsibilities. The Director may also make agreements for the coordination with, or the use of the services or resources of, any other Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such studies.

        (c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this section for a lease sale will be commenced not later than six months prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may use information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate studies for an area or region not identified in the leasing program.

        (d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the Director will conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish additional information and will monitor the human, marine and coastal environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide information, which can be compared with the results of studies conducted prior to OCS oil and gas development. This will be done to identify any significant changes in the quality and productivity of such environments, to establish trends in the area studies, and to design experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings from such studies will be used to recommend modifications in practices that are employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to enhance the data/information base for predicting impacts which might result from a single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.

        (e) Information available or collected by the studies program will, to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management responsibilities.

          § 560.222   How long will a royalty suspension volume be effective for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?

#### § § 560.222

          (a) The royalty suspension volume for your RS lease will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production from your lease reaches the applicable royalty suspension volume or the lease period ends.

          (b)(1) Notwithstanding any royalty suspension volume under this subpart, you must pay royalty at the lease stipulated rate on:

          (i) Any oil produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for light sweet crude oil exceeds the applicable threshold price of $36.39 per barrel, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.

          (ii) Any natural gas produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the NYMEX for natural gas exceeds the applicable threshold price of $4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.

          (iii) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.

          (2) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54, no later than 90 days after the end of the period for which royalty is owed.

          (3) Any production on which you must pay royalty under this paragraph will count toward the production volume determined under §§ 560.120 through 560.124.

          (c) If you must pay royalty on any product (either oil or natural gas) for any period under paragraph (b) of this section, you must continue to pay royalty on that product during the next succeeding period of the same length until the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX prices for that product for that period can be determined. If the arithmetic average of the daily closing prices for that product for that period is less than the threshold price stipulated in the lease, you are entitled to a credit or refund of royalties paid for that period with interest under applicable law.

          § 560.223   How do I measure natural gas production for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?

#### § § 560.223

          You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty suspension volume for your lease as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured according to 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.

          § 560.224   How will royalty suspension apply if BOEM assigns a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 to a field that has a pre-Act lease?

#### § § 560.224

          (a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A) to an existing field or designate a new field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating rights holders in the field of that assignment.

          (1) Within 15 days of the final notification, you or any of the other affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written request with the Director for reconsideration, accompanied by a Statement of Reasons.

          (2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590 and 43 CFR part 4.

          (b) If we establish a royalty suspension volume for a field as a result of an approved application for royalty relief submitted for a pre-Act lease under 30 CFR part 203, then:

          (1) Royalty-free production from your RS lease shares from and counts as part of any royalty suspension volume under § 560.114(d) for the field to which we assign your lease; and

          (2) Your RS lease may continue to produce royalty-free up to the royalty suspension we specified for your lease, even if the field to which we assign your RS lease has produced all of its royalty suspension volume.

          (c) Your lease may share in a suspension volume larger than the royalty suspension with which we issued it and to the extent we grant a larger volume in response to an application by a pre-Act lease submitted under 30 CFR part 203. To share in any larger royalty suspension volume, you must file an application described in 30 CFR part 203 (§§ 203.71 and 203.83). In no case will royalty-free production for your RS lease be less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.

Requests for information and interest shall be published in the  and may be published elsewhere.

        (b) States and local governments, industry, other Federal Agencies, and all interested parties (including the public) may respond to a request for information and interest. All information provided to the Secretary will be considered in the decision whether to proceed with additional steps leading to the offering of OCS minerals for lease.

        (c) The Secretary may request specific information concerning the offering of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS minerals in a broad area for lease or the offering of one or more discrete tracts which represent a minable orebody. The Secretary's request may ask for comments on OCS areas which have been determined to warrant special consideration and analysis. Requests may be for comments concerning geological conditions or archaeological resources on the seabed; multiple uses of the area proposed for leasing, including navigation, recreation and fisheries; and other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information relating to the area proposed for leasing.

        § 581.13   Joint State/Federal coordination.

#### § § 581.13

        (a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may identify as contributing to the leasing process.

        (b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements are to be constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent State Governor(s) may agree.

        (c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for lease.

        (d) With respect to the activities authorized under these regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:

        (1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be offered for lease;

        (2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;

        (3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in the area proposed for leasing;

        (4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be taken to mitigate these problems;

        (5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and

        (6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s).

        (e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., Environmental Impact Statements).

        § 581.14   OCS mining area identification.

#### § § 581.14

        The Secretary, after considering the available OCS mineral resources and environmental data and information, the recommendation of any joint State/Federal task force established pursuant to § 581.13 of this part, and the comments received from interested parties, shall select the tracts to be considered for offering for lease. The selected tracts will be considered in the environmental analysis conducted for the proposed lease offering.

        § 581.15   Tract size.

#### § § 581.15

        The size of the tracts to be offered for lease shall be as determined by the Secretary and specified in the leasing notice. It is intended that tracts offered for lease be sufficiently large to include potentially minable OCS mineral orebodies. When the presence of any minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is needed to discover and delineate OCS minerals, the size of tracts specified in the leasing notice may be relatively large.

        § 581.16   Proposed leasing notice.

#### § § 581.16

        (a) Prior to offering OCS minerals in an area for lease, the Director shall assess the available information including recommendations of any joint State/Federal task force established pursuant to § 581.13 of this part to determine lease sale procedures to be prescribed and to develop a proposed leasing notice which sets out the proposed primary term of the OCS mineral leases to be offered; lease stipulations including measures to mitigate potentially adverse impacts on the environment; and such rental, royalty, and other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice.

        (b) The proposed leasing notice shall be sent to the Governor(s) of any adjacent State(s), and a Notice of its availability shall be published in the  at least 60 days prior to the publication of the leasing notice.

        (c) Written comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) submitted within 60 days after publication of the Notice of Availability of the proposed leasing notice shall be considered by the Secretary.

        (d) Prior to publication of the leasing notice, the Secretary shall respond in writing to the comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) stating the reasons for accepting or rejecting the Governor's recommendations, or for implementing any alternative mutually acceptable approach identified in consultation with the Governor(s) as a means to provide a reasonable balance between the National interest and the well being of the citizens of the adjacent State.

        § 581.17   Leasing notice.

#### § § 581.17

        (a) The Director shall publish the leasing notice in the  at least 30 days prior to the date that OCS minerals will be offered for lease.

#### § § 581.18

        (a) The OCS minerals shall be offered by competitive, cash bonus bidding under terms and conditions specified in the leasing notice and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

        (b)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of sealed bids, such bids received in response to the leasing notice shall be opened at the place, date, and time specified in the leasing notice. The sole purpose of opening bids is to publicly announce and record the bids received, and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at that time.

        (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all sealed bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.

        (3) In the event the highest bids are tie bids when using sealed bidding procedures, the tied bidders may be permitted to submit oral bids to determine the highest cash bonus bidder.

        (c)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of oral bids, oral bids shall be received at the place, time, and date and in accordance with the procedures specified in the leasing notice.

        (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject all oral bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.

        (d) When the leasing notice specifies the use of deferred cash bonus bidding, bids shall be received in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate. The high bid will be determined based upon the net present value of each total bid. The appropriate discount rate will be specified in the leasing notice. High bidders using the deferred bonus option shall pay a minimum of 20 percent of the cash bonus bid prior to lease issuance. At least a total of 60 percent of the cash bonus bid shall be due on or before the 5th anniversary of the lease, and payment of the remainder of the cash bonus bid shall be due on the 10th anniversary of the lease. The lessee shall submit a bond guaranteeing payment of the deferred portion of the bonus, in accordance with § 581.33.

        § 581.19   Lease term.

#### § § 581.19

        An OCS mineral lease for OCS minerals other than sand and gravel shall be for a primary term of not less than 20 years as stipulated in the leasing notice. The primary lease term for each OCS mineral shall be determined based on exploration and development requirements for the OCS minerals being offered by the Secretary. An OCS mineral lease for sand and gravel shall be for a primary term of 10 years unless otherwise stipulated in the leasing notice. A lease will continue beyond the specified primary term for so long thereafter as leased OCS minerals are being produced in accordance with an approved mining operation or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease and the regulations in this chapter under which a lessee can earn continuance of the OCS mineral lease in effect.

        § 581.26   Payments.

#### § § 581.26

        (a) For sealed bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of the total amount bid is required to be submitted with the bid. The percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in the leasing notice. The remittance may be made in cash or by Federal Reserve check, commercial check, bank draft, money order, certified check, or cashier's check made payable to “Department of the Interior—BOEM.” Payment of this portion of the bonus bid may not be made by Electronic Funds Transfer.

        (b) For oral bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of the total amount bid must be submitted to the official designated in the leasing notice following the completion of the oral bidding. The percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in the leasing notice. Payment of this portion of the bonus bid must be made by Electronic Fund Transfer within the timeframe specified in the leasing notice.

        (c) The deposit received from high bidders will be placed in a Treasury account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. Other bids submitted under paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the bidders. If the high bid is subsequently rejected, an amount equal to that deposited with the high bid will be returned according to applicable regulations.

        (d) The balance of the winning bonus bid and all rentals and royalties must be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of this part, the Leasing Notice, and subchapter A of this chapter.

        (e) For each lease issued pursuant to this subpart, there shall be one person identified who shall be solely responsible for all payments due and payable under the provisions of the lease. The single responsible person shall be designated as the payor for the lease and shall be so identified on the Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report (P&R) (Form ONRR-4430) in accordance with 30 CFR 1210.201 of this title. The designated person shall be responsible for all bonus, rental, and royalty payments.

        (f) Royalty shall be computed at the rate specified in the leasing notice, and paid in value unless the Secretary elects to have the royalty delivered in kind.

        (g) For leases which provide for minimum royalty payments, each lessee shall pay the minimum royalty specified in the lease at the end of each lease year beginning with the lease year in which production royalty is paid (whether the full amount specified in the lease or   the amount specified in the lease pursuant to § 581.28(b) on this part) of OCS minerals produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from the leasehold.

        (h)(1) Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The value, for royalty purposes, shall be the gross proceeds received by the lessee for produced substances at the point the product is produced and placed in its first marketable condition, consistent with prevailing practices in the industry. In establishing the value, the Director shall consider, in this order:

        (i) The price received by the lessee;

        (ii) Commodity and spot market transactions;

        (iii) Any other valuation method proposed by the lessee and approved by the Director; and

        (iv) Value or cost netback.

        (2) For non-arm's length transactions, the first benchmark will only be accepted if it is not less than the second benchmark.

        (i) All payors must submit payments and payment forms and maintain auditable records in accordance with 30 CFR chapter XII, Subchapter A—Natural Resources Revenue.

No rental shall be due or payable under a lease commencing with the first lease anniversary date following the commencement of royalty payments on leasehold production computed on the basis of the royalty rate specified in the lease except that annual rental shall be due for any year in which production from the leasehold is not subject to royalty pursuant to § 581.28.

        (b) Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, no annual rental payment shall be due during the first 5 years in the life of a lease.

        (c) The leasee shall pay an annual rental in the amount specified in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease not later than the last day prior to the commencement of the rental year.

        (d) A rental adjustment schedule and amount may be specified in a leasing notice and subsequently issued lease when a variance is warranted by geologic, geographic, technical, or economic conditions.

        § 581.28   Royalty.

#### § § 581.28

        (a) The royalty due the lessor on OCS minerals produced ( sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from a lease shall be set out in a separate schedule attached to and made a part of each lease and shall be as specified in the leasing notice. The royalty due on production shall be based on a percentage of the value or amount of the OCS mineral(s) produced, a sum assessed per unit of product, or other such method as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice. When the royalty specified is a sum assessed per unit of product, the amount of the royalty shall be subject to an annual adjustment based on changes in the appropriate price index, when specified in the leasing notice. When the royalty is specified as a percentage of the value or amount of the OCS minerals produced, the Secretary will notify the lessee when and where royalty is to be delivered in kind. Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.

        (b) When prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, royalty due on OCS minerals produced from a leasehold will be reduced for up to any 5 consecutive years, as specified by the lessee prior to the commencement of production, during the 1st through 15th year in the life of the lease. No royalty shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year period that occurs during the 1st through 10th years in the life of the lease, and a royalty of one-half the amount specified in the lease shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year period that occurs in the 11th through 15th year in the life of the lease. The lessee shall pay the amount specified in the lease rental for any royalty free year. The minimum royalty specified in the lease shall apply during any year of reduced royalty.

        § 581.29   Royalty valuation.

#### § § 581.29

        Unless stated otherwise in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.

        § 581.30   Minimum royalty.

#### § § 581.30

        Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice, each lease issued pursuant to the regulations in this part shall require the payment of a specified minimum annual royalty beginning with the year in which OCS minerals are produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from the leasehold except that the annual rentals shall apply during any year that royalty free production is in effect pursuant to § 581.28(b). Minimum royalty payments shall be offset by royalty paid on production during the lease year. Minimum royalty payments are due at the beginning of the lease year and payable by the end of the month following the end of the lease year for which they are due.

        § 581.31   Overriding royalties.

#### § § 581.31

        (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.

        (b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in § 581.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and § 581.32 of this part.

        § 581.32   Waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty.

#### § § 581.32

        (a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the National interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully operated under existing conditions.

        (b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application shall either:

        (1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for each of the last 12 months immediately prior to filing the application:

        (ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the amount of all overriding royalties and payments out of production paid to others than the United States; and

        (iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or

        (2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and other conditions specified in the lease.

        (c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.

        § 581.33   Bonds and bonding requirements.

#### § § 581.33

        (a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, the lessee's bond will be released.

        (b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a form approved by the Deputy Director. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety.

        (1) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or replacement circulars).

        (2) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.

        (c) Prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease(s), the lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond as described in § 582.40 of this title. Prior to the approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.

        (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, or

        (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease in question.

        (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:

        (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to section (5)(d) of the Act;

        (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of applicable Federal Law; or

#### § § 585.112

        (a) BOEM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis under the procedures in this section with regard to any application or request under this part if we decide at any time that the preparation of a particular document or study is necessary for the application or request and it will have a unique processing cost, such as the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

        (1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through BOEM.

        (2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing costs.

        (b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual application or request according to the following procedures:

        (1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing costs.

        (2) You may comment on the proposed fee.

        (3) You may:

        (i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for processing your application or request; or

        (ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any document, study, or other activity.

        (4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your comments and any BOEM-approved work you will do.

        (i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount of money that we did not spend on processing costs.

        (5) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the date payment is due. If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without our prior written approval.

        (6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final document or take final action on your application or request.

        (7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in § 585.118 and 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision changing the proposed fee, we will adjust the fee in accordance with this section. If we adjust the fee downward, we will not pay interest.

          (5)  BOEM will hold an auction under the regulations in this part and the FSN.

          (6)  BOEM will award leases subsequent to the completion of the aforementioned steps under the regulations in this part and the FSN.

          § 585.211   What is the Call?

#### § § 585.211

          (a) The Call is a notice that BOEM will publish in the  requesting responses from stakeholders interested in bidding on designated OCS areas and comments from interested and potentially affected parties. The responses may inform the area identification process and will enable BOEM to determine whether there exists competitive interest in the proposed lease area.

          § 585.212   What is area identification?

#### § § 585.212

          (a) Area identification is the process by which BOEM delineates one or more OCS areas for leasing consideration and environmental analysis if the areas appear appropriate for renewable energy development. This process is based on an area's relevant attributes, such as other uses of the area, environmental factors or characteristics, stakeholder comments, industry nominations, feasibility for development, and other relevant information. BOEM consults with interested parties during this process as specified in § 585.210(b)(2).

          (b) BOEM may consider areas nominated by respondents to a Call and other areas determined appropriate for leasing.

          (c) For the identified areas, BOEM will evaluate:

          (1) The potential effects of leasing the identified areas on the human, marine, and coastal environments;

          (2) The feasibility of development; and

          (3) Potential measures, including lease stipulations, to mitigate potential adverse impacts. Such measures are identified and refined through the area identification process, as well as through environmental review and consultations and published for comment in the Proposed Sale Notice.

          (d) BOEM may hold public hearings on the environmental analyses associated with leasing the identified areas, after appropriate notice.

          (e) At the end of the area identification, BOEM may offer selected areas for leasing.

          § 585.215   What may BOEM do to assess whether competitive interest for a lease area still exists before the auction?

#### § § 585.215

          (a) At any time BOEM has reason to believe that competitive interest in any lease area no longer exists before the area's auction, BOEM may issue a notice in the  as described in § 585.116, requesting information regarding competitive interest in that area. BOEM will consider respondents' comments to determine whether competitive interest in that area remains. BOEM may decide to end the competitive process for any area if it determines that competitive interest no longer exists.

          (b) If BOEM determines after considering respondents' comments to such a notice that competitive interest remains, BOEM will continue with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226.

          (c) If BOEM determines at any time before the auction that only a single party remains interested in a lease area, BOEM may proceed either with the auction or with the noncompetitive process set forth in § 585.231(d) through (j) following payment by that party of the acquisition fee specified in § 585.502(a).

          § 585.216   How are bidding credits awarded and used?

#### § § 585.216

          (a) BOEM will determine the highest bid, taking into account the combined value of the monetary (cash) component and the non-monetary component(s), represented by bidding credits. The PSN and FSN will explain the following details, if bidding credit(s) are available for that auction:

          (1) Eligibility and application requirements;

          (2) The value of each available bidding credit, which will be either a sum certain or a percentage of the bid; and

          (3) Procedures for applying each available bidding credit to bids submitted during the auction.

          (b) Eligibility for bidding credits must be established in advance of any lease auction, in accordance with the specifications of the FSN. Such eligibility may be based on actions that the bidder has already undertaken or actions that it has committed to undertake in the future, provided that BOEM has agreed to the terms by which such a commitment will be made. BOEM may offer bidding credits for any of the following:

          (1) Power purchase agreements;

          (2) Eligibility for, or applicability of, renewable energy credits or subsidies;

          (3) Development agreements by a potential lessee that facilitate shared transmission solutions and grid interconnection;

          (4) Technical merit, timeliness, or financing and economic considerations;

          (5) Environmental considerations, public benefits, or compatibility with State and local needs;

          (6) Agreements or commitments by the developer that would facilitate OCS renewable energy development or other OCSLA goals; or

          (7) Any other factor or criteria to further development of offshore renewable energy, as identified by BOEM in the PSN and FSN.

          (c) Before the auction, bidders seeking to use bidding credits must establish that they meet the eligibility criteria for each bidding credit according to the FSN provisions.

          (d) Before the auction, BOEM will determine each bidder's eligibility for bidding credits, and the value of those bidding credits, and will inform each eligible bidder of the value of the bidding credits to which it may be entitled.

          (e) A provisional winner who is awarded bidding credits must pay an amount equal to the cash component of its winning bid less any bid deposit retained by BOEM under § 585.501.

          (d) Any time before a provisional winner is determined, BOEM may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction due to a natural or man-made disaster, technical malfunction, security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or any other reason that BOEM determines may adversely affect the fair and efficient conduct of the auction. In its discretion, BOEM may restart the auction at whatever point it deems appropriate, reasonable, fair, and efficient for all participants; or, alternatively, BOEM may cancel the auction in its entirety.

          (e) BOEM will determine the provisional winner for each lease area under the auction rules and bidding procedures prescribed in the FSN.

          (1) Declare the bidding closed.

          (2) Assess whether the bids meet the requirements of BOEM's regulations and the FSN. BOEM may disqualify bids based on this review.

          (3) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(c), provide the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, the opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of the lease sale results. BOEM may disqualify bids based on the results of this review.

          (4) BOEM will declare the provisional winner of each lease area.

          (b) BOEM may reject any and all bids received, regardless of the amount offered.

          (c) BOEM will accept or reject bids within 90 calendar days of auction closure; BOEM may extend that time by notice to bidders within 15 calendar days before the 90 calendar day period ends.

          (d) BOEM will deem rejected any bid not accepted within the 90 calendar-day period, or any extension. BOEM will provide each rejected bidder a written explanation for the rejection and will refund, without interest, any monies deposited by the rejected bidder.

          (e) BOEM may withdraw all or part of a lease area from the lease sale between auction closure and lease execution. In the event that a portion of the lease area is withdrawn, the provisional winner has the option to refuse the lease without penalty, to propose new lease terms for BOEM's concurrence, or to accept the lease with the reduced area.

          (f) BOEM may re-auction any lease area or portions thereof that remain unsold at the conclusion of an auction.

          § 585.225   What happens if BOEM accepts a bid?

#### § § 585.225

          (a) BOEM will identify and notify the lease area's provisional winner of the amount due on each winning bid, which equals the cash component of the provisional winner's bid less its bid deposit retained by BOEM under § 585.501. BOEM will provide an unsigned copy of the lease to the provisional winner.

          (b) Within 10 business days after receipt of the unsigned copy, or as otherwise specified by BOEM under paragraph (d) of this section, the provisional winner must:

          (1) Execute the lease and return it to BOEM;

          § 585.226   What happens if the provisional winner fails to meet its obligations?

#### § § 585.226

          (a) If BOEM determines that a provisional winner has failed to timely complete the steps outlined in § 585.225(b) or § 585.316, or has otherwise failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or FSN provisions, BOEM may take one or more of the following actions:

          (1) Decline to execute the applicable lease.

          (2) Decline to execute the lease for any other lease areas that the provisional winner won during the auction.

          (3) Require forfeiture of the bid deposit. In the event the bid deposit exceeds the amount of the winning bid, BOEM would limit the required forfeiture to the lesser amount.

          (4) Refer the matter to the Department of the Interior's Administrative Remedies Division for suspension or debarment review pursuant to 2 CFR part 180 as implemented at 2 CFR part 1400.

          (5) Pursue any other remedy available.

          (b) If BOEM declines to execute a lease with the provisional winner under paragraph (a) of this section, BOEM may decide to select a new provisional winner by either repeating the auction under § 585.224(f), or pursuant to the procedures in § 585.223(a)(8), by selecting the next highest bid submitted during the auction, or by using other procedures specified in the FSN.

          (f) Documentation showing that you meet the qualifications to become a lessee, as specified in §§ 585.107 and 585.108.

          (g) An acquisition fee, as specified in § 585.502(a).

          § 585.231   Will BOEM issue leases noncompetitively?

#### § § 585.231

          (a) BOEM will consider unsolicited requests for a lease on a case-by-case basis and may issue a lease noncompetitively in accordance with this part. BOEM will issue a lease noncompetitively only if it has determined after public notice that no competitive interest exists. BOEM will not consider an unsolicited request for a lease under this part that is proposed in a lease area that is scheduled for a lease auction under this part.

          (b) At BOEM's discretion, BOEM may issue an RFI under § 585.116 relating to your unsolicited lease request and will consider comments received to determine if competitive interest exists. If BOEM decides not to issue an RFI and, therefore, not to continue processing your unsolicited lease request, it will refund your acquisition fee.

          (c) If BOEM determines that competitive interest exists in the lease area:

          (1) BOEM will proceed with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226;

          (2) If you submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, your acquisition fee will be applied to the deposit for your bonus bid; and

          (3) If you do not submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, BOEM will not refund your acquisition fee.

          (d) If BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in a lease and that further investigation of the area is in the public interest, it will:

          (1) Publish in the  a determination of no competitive interest.

          (2) Prepare and provide you with a written estimate of the proposed fee to pay for the processing costs under § 585.112, including any environmental review that BOEM may require before lease issuance.

          (3) Conduct environmental reviews required by Federal law and consult with affected Federal agencies, federally recognized Indian Tribes, and State and local governments.

          (e) The following deadlines apply after issuance of a determination of no competitive interest:

          (1) Within 90 calendar days of receiving the written estimate of the fee, or longer (as determined at BOEM's discretion), you must pay the fee for any environmental review under § 585.112. Failure to pay the required fee may result in withdrawal of the determination of no competitive interest.

          (2) A determination of no competitive interest expires two years after its publication, unless BOEM determines that it should be extended for good cause. BOEM reserves the right to withdraw a determination of no competitive interest before it expires if BOEM determines that you have failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining a lease.

          (g) After completing its review of your lease request, BOEM may offer you a noncompetitive lease.

          (h) If you accept the terms and conditions of the lease, BOEM will issue the lease. You must comply with the terms and conditions of your lease and the applicable provisions of this part. If BOEM issues you a lease, BOEM will send you an electronic copy of the lease form.

          (1) Within 10 business days after you receive the lease you must:

          (i) Execute and return the lease; and

          (i) BOEM will publish in the  a notice announcing the issuance of your lease.

          (j) If you do not accept the terms and conditions in a timely manner, BOEM will not issue a lease. Additionally, if you do not comply with the requirements for financial assurance, BOEM may decide not to issue a lease. If BOEM does not issue a lease due to your noncompliance or non-acceptance, BOEM will not refund your acquisition fee, or any fees paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

          § 585.232   May I acquire a lease noncompetitively after responding to a request for information or a Call for Information and Nominations?

#### § § 585.232

        Commercial and Limited Lease Periods

          § 585.235   What are the lease periods for a commercial lease?

#### § § 585.235

          (a) The lease periods within the term of your commercial lease are defined as follows:

          (1)  Each commercial lease has a preliminary period of up to five years. During the preliminary period, the lessee must submit a COP. The preliminary period begins on the effective date of the lease and ends either when a COP is received by BOEM for review or at the expiration of five years, whichever occurs first.

          (2)  A commercial lease has a _COP review period._ The COP review period begins when BOEM receives a COP from the lessee and ends upon COP approval, disapproval, or approval with conditions pursuant to § 585.628. During the COP review period, BOEM conducts the necessary reviews and consultations associated with the COP.

          (3)  The design and construction period begins at COP approval and ends when the operations period begins. During the design and construction period BSEE completes the FDR and FIR review(s), and the lessee undertakes project construction.

          (4)  A commercial lease has an operations period of 35 years; or the duration specified in the lease; or the duration included and approved as part of your COP. The operations period begins when the requirements of 30 CFR 285.637(a) are met through the submission of final reports and records for your project. Additional time may be added to the operations period through a lease suspension under § 585.415 issued during this period; a lease extension requested pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section; or a lease renewal under § 585.425.

          (b) You may request an extension of any of the lease periods outlined in paragraph (a) of this section for good cause, including if the project is designed and verified for a longer duration. In its discretion, BOEM may approve your request.

          (c) If you intend to develop your lease in phases under § 585.238, you must propose lease period schedules for each phase in your COP.

          (d) If you intend to segregate or consolidate your lease under §§ 585.408 through 585.413, you and your assignees may propose lease period schedules in your segregation or consolidation application.

          § 585.236   If I have a limited lease, how long will my lease remain in effect?

#### § § 585.236

          (a) For limited leases, the lease periods are as shown in the following table:

          (b) You may request an extension of any of the lease periods outlined in paragraph (a) of this section for good cause. In its discretion, BOEM may approve your request.

          § 585.237   What is the effective date of a lease?

#### § § 585.237

          (a) A lease issued under this part must be dated and becomes effective as of the first day of the month following the date a lease is signed by the lessor.

          (b) If the lessee submits a written request and BOEM approves, a lease may be dated and become effective the first day of the month in which it is signed by the lessor.

          § 585.238   May I develop my commercial lease in phases?

#### § § 585.238

          In your COP, you may request development of your commercial lease in phases. In support of your request, you must provide details as to what portions of the lease will be initially developed for commercial operations and what portions of the lease will be reserved for subsequent phased development. You must also propose a lease period schedule for each phase described in your COP in accordance with § 585.235(c). BOEM may condition its approval of subsequent phases described in a phased development COP.

          § 585.239   Are there any other renewable energy research activities that will be allowed on the OCS?

#### § § 585.239

          (a) The Director may issue OCS leases, ROW grants, and RUE grants to a Federal agency or a State for renewable energy research activities that support the future production, transportation, or transmission of renewable energy.

          (b) In issuing leases, ROW grants, and RUE grants to a Federal agency or a State on the OCS for renewable energy research activities under this section, BOEM will coordinate and consult with other relevant Federal agencies, affected federally recognized Indian Tribes, any other affected State(s), and affected local government executives.

          (c) BOEM may issue leases, RUEs, and ROWs for research activities managed by a Federal agency or a State only in areas for which the Director has determined, after public notice and opportunity to comment, that no competitive interest exists.

          (d) The Director and the head of the Federal agency or the Governor of a requesting State, or their authorized representatives, will negotiate the terms and conditions of such renewable energy leases, RUEs, or ROWs under this section on a case-by-case basis. The framework for such negotiations, and standard terms and conditions of such leases, RUEs, or ROWs may be set forth in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) or other agreement between BOEM and a Federal agency or a State. The MOA must include the agreement of the head of the Federal agency or the Governor to assure that all subcontractors comply with this part and 30 CFR part 285, other applicable laws, and terms and conditions of such leases or grants.

          (e) Any lease, RUE, or ROW that BOEM issues to a Federal agency or to a State that authorizes access to an area of the OCS for research activities managed by a Federal agency or a State must include:

          (1) Requirements to comply with all applicable Federal laws; and

          (2) Requirements to comply with this part and 30 CFR part 285, except as otherwise provided in the lease or grant.

          (f) BOEM will issue a public notice of any lease, RUE, or ROW issued to a Federal agency or to a State, or an approved MOA for such research activities.

          (g) BOEM will not charge any fees for the purpose of ensuring a fair return for the use of such research areas on the OCS.

        ROW Grants and RUE Grants

          § 585.300   What types of activities are authorized by ROW grants and RUE grants issued under this part?

#### § § 585.300

          (a) A ROW grant authorizes the holder to install on the OCS cables, pipelines, and associated facilities that involve the transportation or transmission of electricity or other energy product from renewable energy projects.

          (b) A RUE grant authorizes the holder to construct and maintain facilities or other installations on the OCS that support the production, transportation, or transmission of electricity or other energy product from any renewable energy resource.

          (c) You do not need a ROW grant or RUE grant for a project easement authorized under § 585.200(b) to serve your lease.

          § 585.301   What do ROW grants and RUE grants include?

#### § § 585.301

          (a) A ROW grant:

          (1) Includes the full length of the corridor on which a cable, pipeline, or associated facility is located;

          (2) Is of a width sufficient to accommodate potential changes at the design and installation phases of the project, with an option for the grant holder to relinquish unused portions of the ROW after construction is complete; and

          (3) For the associated facilities, is limited to the area reasonably necessary for a power or pumping station or other facilities requested.

          (b) A RUE grant includes the site on which a facility or other structure is located and the areal extent of anchors, chains, and other equipment associated with a facility or other structure. The specific boundaries of a RUE will be determined by BOEM on a case-by-case basis and set forth in each RUE grant.

          § 585.302   What are the general requirements for ROW grant and RUE grant holders?

#### § § 585.302

          (a) To acquire a ROW grant or RUE grant, you must provide evidence that you meet the qualifications set forth in §§ 585.107 and 585.108.

          (b) A ROW grant or RUE grant is subject to the following conditions:

          (1) The rights granted will not prevent the granting of other rights by the United States, either before or after the granting of the ROW or RUE, provided that any subsequent authorization issued by BOEM in the area of a previously issued ROW grant or RUE grant may not unreasonably interfere with activities approved or impede existing operations under such a grant; and

          (2) The holder agrees that the United States, its lessees, or other ROW grant or RUE grant holders may use or occupy any part of the ROW grant or RUE grant not actually occupied or necessarily incident to its use for any necessary activities.

          § 585.303   How long will my ROW grant or RUE grant remain in effect?

#### § § 585.303

          The periods within the term of your grant are defined as follows:

          (a) Each ROW or RUE grant has a preliminary period of 12 months from the effective date of the ROW or RUE grant within which to submit a GAP. The preliminary period begins on the effective date of the grant. You must submit a GAP no later than the end of the preliminary period for your grant to remain in effect. However, you may submit a GAP before the issuance of your ROW or RUE grant.

          (b) Each ROW or RUE grant has an operations period as set by BOEM (if the grant is issued competitively) or negotiated with the applicant (if the grant is issued noncompetitively). In either case, the duration of the operations period will depend on the intended use of the grant. The operations period begins on the date that we approve your GAP.

          (c) You may request an extension of any of the grant periods outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for good cause. In its discretion, BOEM may approve your request.

          § 585.304   [Reserved]

#### § § 585.304

        Obtaining ROW Grants and RUE Grants

          § 585.305   How do I request a ROW grant or a RUE grant?

#### § § 585.305

          You must submit a request for a new or modified ROW grant or RUE grant to BOEM pursuant to § 585.111. You must submit a separate request for each ROW grant or RUE grant you are requesting. The request must contain the following information:

          (a) The area you are requesting for a ROW grant or RUE grant.

          (b) A general description of your objectives and the facilities that you would use to achieve those objectives.

          (c) A general schedule of proposed activities.

          (d) Pertinent information concerning environmental conditions in the area of interest.

          § 585.306   What action will BOEM take on my request?

#### § § 585.306

          BOEM will consider requests for ROW grants and RUE grants on a case-by-case basis and may issue a grant competitively, as provided in § 585.308, or noncompetitively if we determine after public notice that there is no competitive interest. BOEM will coordinate and consult with relevant Federal agencies, the Governor of any affected State, and the executive of any affected local government.

          (a) In response to an unsolicited request for a ROW grant or RUE grant, BOEM will first determine if there is competitive interest, as provided in § 585.307.

          (b) If BOEM determines there is no competitive interest in a ROW or RUE grant, BOEM will publish a notice in the  of such determination. After BOEM publishes this notice, you are responsible for submitting any required consistency certification and necessary data and information in a timely manner to BOEM and the applicable State CZMA agency pursuant to 15 CFR part 930, subpart D. BOEM may establish terms and conditions for a noncompetitive grant and offer the grant to you:

          (1) If you accept the terms and conditions of the grant, BOEM will issue the grant.

          (2) If you do not accept the terms and conditions of the grant, BOEM may agree to modify the terms and conditions or may decide not to issue the grant.

          § 585.307   How will BOEM determine whether competitive interest exists for ROW grants and RUE grants?

#### § § 585.307

          To determine whether or not there is competitive interest:

          (a) We will publish a public notice, generally describing the parameters of the project, to give affected and interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed ROW grant or RUE grant area.

          (b) We will evaluate any comments received on the notice and make a determination of the level of competitive interest.

          (c) BOEM may consider a State's or Regional Transmission Operator/Independent System Operator's process that identifies a transmission project that needs a ROW and/or a RUE grant to achieve its intended purpose. BOEM may determine that there is no competitive interest that would be consistent with OCSLA's goal of allowing the expeditious and orderly development of OCS energy projects, if offering the ROW and/or RUE competitively could challenge the viability of the transmission project intended to be located on State submerged lands and the OCS (e.g., technical and economic feasibility or practicality concerns, including significant delays, by having different entities holding the right to develop the transmission project in State submerged lands and the OCS).

          § 585.308   How will BOEM conduct an auction for ROW grants and RUE grants?

#### § § 585.308

          (a) If BOEM determines that there is competitive interest, we will:

          (1) Publish a notice of each grant auction in the  describing auction procedures, allowing interested persons 30 days to comment; and

          (2) Conduct a competitive auction for issuing the ROW grant or RUE grant. The auction process for ROW grants and RUE grants will be conducted following the same process for leases set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226.

          (b) If you are the successful bidder in an auction, you must pay the first year's rent, as provided in § 585.316.

          § 585.309   What is the effective date of a ROW grant or a RUE grant?

#### § § 585.309

          Your ROW grant or RUE grant becomes effective on the date established by BOEM on the ROW grant or RUE grant instrument.

#### § § 585.315

          (a) You must make a deposit, as required in § 585.501(a), regardless of whether the auction is a sealed-bid, oral, electronic, or other auction format. BOEM will specify in the sale notice the official to whom you must submit the payment, the time by which the official must receive the payment, and the forms of acceptable payment.

          (b) If your high bid is rejected, we will provide a written statement of reasons.

          (c) For all rejected bids, we will refund, without interest, any money deposited with your bid.

          § 585.316   What payments are required for ROW grants or RUE grants?

#### § § 585.316

          Before we issue the ROW grant or RUE grant, you must pay:

          (a) Any balance on accepted high bids to Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), as provided in the sale notice.

          (b) An annual rent for the first year of the grant, as specified in § 585.508.

        Designation of Operator

          § 585.405   How do I designate an operator?

#### § § 585.405

          (a) If you intend to designate an operator who is not the lessee or grant holder, you must identify the proposed operator in your SAP (under § 585.610(a)(3)), COP (under § 585.626(a)(2)), or GAP (under § 585.645(a)(2)), as applicable. If no operator is designated in a SAP, COP, or GAP, BOEM will deem the lessee or grant holder to be the operator.

          (b) An operator must be designated in any SAP, COP, or GAP if there is more than one lessee or grant holder for any individual lease or grant.

          (c) Once approved in your plan, the designated operator is authorized to act on your behalf and required to perform activities necessary to comply with the OCS Lands Act, the lease or grant, and the regulations in this part.

          (d) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide BOEM with a written notification of change of address of the lessee or operator.

          (e) If there is a change in the designated operator, you must provide written notice to BOEM and identify the new designated operator within 72 hours on a form approved by BOEM. The lessee(s) or grantee(s) is the operator and responsible for compliance until BOEM approves designation of the new operator.

          (f) Designation of an operator under any lease or grant issued under this part does not relieve the lessee or grant holder of its obligations under this part or its lease or grant.

          (g) A designated operator performing activities on the lease must comply with all regulations governing those activities and may be held liable or penalized for any noncompliance during the time it was the operator, notwithstanding its subsequent resignation.

          § 585.406   Who is responsible for fulfilling lease and grant obligations?

#### § § 585.406

          (a) When you are not the sole lessee or grantee, you and your co-lessee(s) or co-grantee(s) are jointly and severally responsible for fulfilling your obligations under the lease or grant and the provisions of this part and 30 CFR part 285, unless otherwise provided in this part.

          (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your obligations under the lease or grant and this part, BOEM may require you or any or all of your co-lessees or co-grantees to fulfill those obligations or other operational obligations under the OCS Lands Act, the lease, grant, or this part.

          (c) Whenever the regulations in this part require the lessee or grantee to conduct an activity in a prescribed manner, the lessee or grantee and operator (if one has been designated) are jointly and severally responsible for complying with this part.

#### § § 585.407

        Lease or Grant Assignment, Segregation, and Consolidation

          § 585.408   May I assign my lease or grant interest?

#### § § 585.408

          (a) You may assign all or part of your lease or grant interest, including record title, to one or more parties, subject to BOEM approval under this subpart. Each instrument that creates or transfers an interest must describe the entire tract or describe by officially designated subdivisions the interest you propose to create or transfer. Your application to assign a lease or grant may include a request to modify the existing lease or grant period schedule consistent with § 585.235(d).

          (b) If you submit an application to assign a lease or grant, you will continue to be responsible for payments that are or become due on the lease or grant until the date BOEM approves the assignment.

          (c) The assignment takes effect on the first day of the month following the date on which BOEM approves your request, unless you request an earlier effective date and BOEM approves that earlier date, but such earlier effective date, if prior to the date of BOEM's approval, does not relieve you of your obligations accrued between that earlier effective date and the date of approval.

          (d) You do not need to request an assignment for business mergers, name changes, or changes of business form. You must notify BOEM of these events under § 585.110.

          § 585.409   How do I request approval of a lease or grant assignment?

#### § § 585.409

          (a) You must request approval of each assignment on a form approved by BOEM and submit originals of each instrument that creates or transfers ownership of record title or certified copies thereof within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer agreement.

          (b) Any assignee will be subject to all the terms and conditions of your original lease or grant, including the requirement to furnish financial assurance in the amount required in §§ 585.516 through 585.537.

          (c) The assignee must submit proof of eligibility and other qualifications specified in §§ 585.107 and 585.108.

          (d) Persons executing on behalf of the assignor and assignee must furnish evidence of authority to execute the assignment.

          § 585.410   When will my assignment result in a segregated lease?

#### § § 585.410

          (a) When there is an assignment by all record title owners of 100 percent of the record title to one or more aliquots in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such a case, both the new lease and the remaining portion of the original lease are referred to as “segregated leases” and the assignee becomes the record title owner of the new lease, which is subject to all the terms and conditions of the original lease. The financial assurance requirements of subpart F of this part apply separately to each segregated lease.

          (b) If a record title owner transfers an undivided interest of less than 100 percent of the record title interest in any given aliquot, that transfer will not segregate the portions of that aliquot, or the whole aliquot, in which part of the record title was transferred, into a separate lease from the portions in which no interest was transferred. Instead, that transfer will create a joint ownership between the assignee and assignor in the portions of the lease in which part of the record title interest was transferred.

          (c) When a lease becomes segregated, BOEM may issue separate Plan approvals for a segregated lease or take other actions within its discretion.

          § 585.411   How does an assignment affect the assignor's liability?

#### § § 585.411

          As assignor, you are liable for all obligations, monetary and nonmonetary, that accrued under your lease or grant before BOEM approves your assignment. Our approval of the assignment does not relieve you of these accrued obligations. BOEM may require you to bring the lease or grant into compliance to the extent the obligation accrued before the effective date of your assignment if your assignee or subsequent assignees fail to perform any obligation under the lease or grant.

          § 585.412   How does an assignment affect the assignee's liability?

#### § § 585.412

          (a) As assignee, you are liable for all lease or grant obligations that accrue after BOEM approves the assignment. As assignee, you must comply with all the terms and conditions of the lease or grant and all applicable regulations, remedy all existing environmental and operational problems on the lease or grant, and comply with all decommissioning requirements under 30 CFR part 285, subpart I.

          (b) Assignees are bound to comply with each term or condition of the lease or grant and the regulations in this part and 30 CFR part 285. You are jointly and severally liable for the performance of all obligations under the lease or grant and under the regulations in this part and 30 CFR part 285 with each prior and subsequent lessee who held an interest from the time the obligation accrued until it is satisfied, unless this part provides otherwise.

          § 585.413   How do I consolidate leases or grants?

#### § § 585.413

          (a) You may apply to consolidate all or part of two or more adjacent leases or grants held by the same lessee or grant holder into one new lease or grant, subject to BOEM's approval. The application must include a description of the leases or grants, or portions thereof, to be consolidated, including the relevant lease number, lease blocks, and aliquots.

          (b) An approved consolidation will create a new lease or grant that will be subject to the terms and conditions of the consolidated leases or grants.

          (c) To the extent the leases or grants to be consolidated have different times remaining in the relevant lease or grant periods, BOEM will default to using the shorter remaining periods in the new lease or grant but will consider requests for a revised lease or grant period schedule included in the consolidation application.

          (d) To the extent the leases or grants to be consolidated have other different terms and conditions, BOEM will default to using the terms and conditions in the most recently issued lease or grant to be consolidated for the new lease. BOEM will consider requests for modifications on a case-by-case basis and, in its discretion, approve such requests for good cause.

          (e) Before BOEM will approve your consolidation request, BOEM will assess appropriate financial assurance obligations for the new lease or grant per §§ 585.516 and 585.517 or §§ 585.520 and 585.521.

          (f) Any consolidated leases and grants that have been absorbed into the new lease or grant in their entirety will be considered terminated at the time of consolidation approval.

#### § § 585.415

          (a) A suspension is an interruption of the period of your lease or grant that may occur:

          § 585.420   What effect does a suspension order have on my payments?

#### § § 585.420

          (a) While BOEM evaluates your request for a suspension under § 585.416, you must continue to fulfill your payment obligation until the end of the original term of your lease or grant. If our evaluation goes beyond the end of the original term of your lease or grant, the term of your lease or grant will be extended for the period of time necessary for BOEM to complete its evaluation of your request, but you will not be required to make payments during the time of the extension.

          (b) If BOEM approves your request for a suspension under § 585.416, or orders a suspension under § 585.417, BOEM may waive or defer your payment obligations during the suspension.

          Once you commence commercial operations, you must pay ONRR as provided in 30 CFR 1218.51 operating fees on your commercial lease as described in § 585.503.

          (a) BOEM will determine the annual operating fee for activities relating to the generation of electricity on your lease based on the formula F = M * H * c * P * r, where:

          (1) F is the dollar amount of the annual operating fee;

          (2) M is the nameplate capacity expressed in megawatts;

          (3) H is the number of hours in a year, equal to 8,760, used to calculate an annual payment;

          (4) c is the “capacity factor” representing the anticipated efficiency of the facility's operation expressed as a decimal between zero and one;

          (5) P is a measure of the annual average wholesale electric power price expressed in dollars per megawatt hour, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

          (6) r is the operating fee rate expressed as a decimal between zero and one.

          (b) The annual operating fee formula relating to the value of annual electricity generation is restated as:

          (c) BOEM will specify operating fee parameters in the Final Sale Notice for commercial leases issued competitively and in the lease for those issued noncompetitively.

          (1) Unless BOEM specifies otherwise, the operating fee rate “r” is 0.02 for each year the operating fee applies when you begin commercial operations. We may apply a different fee rate for new projects ( a new generation based on new technology) after considering factors such as program objectives, state of the industry, project type, and project potential. Also, we may agree to reduce or waive the fee rate under § 585.510.

          (2) The power price “P,” for each year when the operating fee applies, will be determined annually. The process by which the power price will be determined will be specified in the Final Sale Notice and/or in the lease. BOEM:

          (i) Will use the most recent annual average wholesale power price in the State in which a project's transmission cables make landfall, as published by the Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), or other publicly available wholesale power price indices; and

          (ii) May adjust the published average wholesale power price to reflect documented variations by State or within a region and recent market conditions.

          (3) BOEM will select the capacity factor “c” based upon applicable analogs drawn from present and future domestic and foreign projects that operate in comparable conditions and on comparable scales.

          (i) Upon the completion of the first year of the operations period on a lease, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor as necessary (to accurately represent a comparison of actual production over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have produced if it had run at full capacity) in a subsequent year.

          (ii) After the first adjustment, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor (to accurately represent a comparison of actual generation over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have generated if it had run at full capacity) no earlier than in 5-year intervals from the most recent year that BOEM adjusts the capacity factor.

          (iii) The process by which BOEM will adjust the capacity factor, including any calculations (incorporating an average capacity factor reflecting actual operating experience), will be specified in the lease. The operator or lessee may request review and adjustment of the capacity factor under § 585.510.

          (4) For the nameplate capacity “M,” BOEM will use the total installed capacity of the equipment you install, as specified in your approved COP.

          (d) You must submit all operating fee payments to ONRR in accordance with the provisions under 30 CFR 1218.51.

          (e) BOEM will establish the operating fee in the Final Sale Notice or in the lease on a case-by-case basis for:

          (1) Activities that do not relate to the generation of electricity ( hydrogen production); and

          (2) Leases issued for hydrokinetic activities requiring a FERC license.

          § 585.507   What rent payments must I pay on a project easement?

#### § § 585.507

          (a) You must pay rent to ONRR as provided in 30 CFR 1218.51 for your project easement in the amount of $5 per acre, subject to a minimum of $450 per year, unless specified otherwise in the lease.

          (1) The size of the project easement will be determined according to § 585.628(g)(1).

          (2) The size of a project easement area for an accessory platform is limited to the areal extent of anchor chains and other facilities and devices associated with the accessory.

          (b) You must commence rent payments for your project easement upon our approval of your COP or GAP:

          (1) You must make the first rent payment as provided in § 585.500;

          (2) You must submit all subsequent rent payments in accordance with the regulations at 30 CFR 1218.51; and

          (3) You must continue to pay annual rent for your project easement until your lease is terminated.

        Financial Assurance Requirements for Commercial Leases

          § 585.516   What are the financial assurance requirements for each stage of my commercial lease?

#### § § 585.516

          (a) The financial assurance requirements for each stage of your commercial lease are:

          (b) Each bond or other authorized financial assurance must guarantee compliance with this part, the applicable plan approvals, and the terms and conditions of the lease.

          § 585.517   How will BOEM determine the supplemental financial assurance associated with commercial leases?

#### § § 585.517

          (a) BOEM determines the amount of your supplemental financial assurance based on the estimated costs to meet all accrued lease obligations, including:

          (1) The projected amount of annual rent and other payments due to the United States over the next 12 months, to the extent that amount is not covered in the initial financial assurance provided in § 585.516(a)(1);

          (2) Any past due rent and other payments;

          (3) Other monetary obligations; and

        Financial Assurance for Limited Leases, ROW Grants, and RUE Grants

          § 585.520   What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant?

#### § § 585.520

          Before BOEM will execute your limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant, or approve an assignment of an interest therein, you or a proposed assignee must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant by providing a bond or other authorized financial assurance in the amount of 12 months' rent.

          § 585.521   Do my financial assurance requirements change as activities progress on my limited lease or grant?

#### § § 585.521

          (a) BOEM may require you to increase or allow you to decrease the amount of your financial assurance as activities progress on your limited lease or grant based on the estimated costs to meet all accrued lease or grant obligations.

          (b) The total amount of the financial assurance must be no less than the amount required to meet your limited lease and grant obligations, including:

          (1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due to the United States over the next 12 months;

          (2) Any past due rent and other payments;

          (3) Other monetary obligations; and

          (c) If BOEM proposes adjusting the amount of your financial assurance to ensure your limited lease and grant obligations are met, BOEM will notify you of the proposed adjustment and will provide you an opportunity to object.

          (d) You may submit a written request to BOEM to reduce the amount of your financial assurance if your proposed amount is not less than the sum of your obligations listed in paragraph (b) of this section. BOEM may approve your request in its discretion.

          (e) You may satisfy the requirement for increased financial assurance on your limited lease or grant by increasing the amount of your existing bond or by providing a supplemental bond or other financial assurance.

          (1) The supplemental bond or other financial assurance must meet the requirements specified in §§ 585.525 through 585.529.

          (2) If you propose to incrementally fund your financial assurance, BOEM must approve the schedule for providing the appropriate financial assurance.

        Requirements for Financial Assurance Instruments

          § 585.525   What general requirements must a financial assurance instrument meet?

#### § § 585.525

          (a) Any bond or other acceptable financial assurance instrument that you provide must:

          (1) Be payable to BOEM upon demand; and

          (2) Guarantee compliance of all lessees, grant holders, operators, and payors with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant, any subsequent approvals and authorizations, and all applicable regulations.

          (b) All bonds and other forms of financial assurance must be on or in a form approved by BOEM. You may submit this on an approved form that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If the document you submit omits any terms and conditions that are included on the BOEM-approved form, your bond is deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.

          (c) Surety bonds must be issued by an approved surety listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, as required by 31 CFR 223.16. You may obtain a copy of Circular 570 from the Treasury website at .

          (d) Your surety bond cannot exceed the underwriting limit listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, except as permitted therein.

          (e) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When the surety is a corporation, an authorized corporate officer must sign the bond and attest to it over the corporate seal.

          (f) You may not terminate the period of liability of your bond or cancel your bond, except as provided in this subpart. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event has occurred that could diminish or terminate a surety's obligation under State law.

          (g) Your surety must notify you and BOEM within 5 business days after:

          (1) It initiates any judicial or administrative proceeding alleging its insolvency or bankruptcy; or

          (2) The Treasury decertifies the surety.

          § 585.526   What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to meet the financial assurance requirement?

#### § § 585.526

          (a) You may use other types of security instruments, if BOEM determines that such security protects BOEM to the same extent as the surety bond. BOEM will consider pledges of the following:

          (1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 225;

          (2) A pledge of cash, in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal depository account of the U.S. Treasury;

          (3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the United States with:

          (i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and

          (ii) Minimum  Safe & Sound rating of 3 Stars, and Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;

          (4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM;

          (5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized securities rating service having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM;

          (6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating service;

          (7) Letters of credit, subject to the following conditions:

          (i) The letter of credit provider must have an issuer credit rating from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) greater than or equal to investment grade from either Standard & Poor's Ratings Service or Moody's Investor Service, or a proxy credit rating determined by BOEM based on audited financial information (including an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the auditor's certificate) greater than or equal to investment grade from either Standard & Poor's Ratings Service or Moody's Investor Service;

          (ii) The letter of credit must grant BOEM full authority to demand immediate payment in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of a lease or regulatory obligations;

          (iii) The letter of credit must be irrevocable during its term and will be subject to collection by BOEM if not replaced by another letter of credit or other form of financial assurance at least 30 calendar days before its expiration date;

          (iv) The expiration date of the letter of credit must not be less than 90 days following the date it becomes effective;

          (v) The letter of credit must contain a provision for automatic renewal for periods of not less than 1 year in the absence of notice of cancellation to BOEM at least 90 calendar days before the expiration date; and

          (vi) The letter of credit must contain a venue provision, which requires any disputes to be adjudicated in a U.S. Federal court that is mutually agreed upon by BOEM and the issuers of the letter of credit;

          (8) Another form of security approved by BOEM in its discretion; or

          (9) A combination of security instruments described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.

          (b) If you use a Treasury security:

          (1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;

          (2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with 31 CFR part 203, Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at ), falls below the required level of coverage, you must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required amount; and

          (3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.

          (c) If you use the instruments described in paragraph (a)(4) or (5) of this section, you must provide BOEM by the end of each calendar year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee concerning the asset value of the account.

          § 585.527   May I demonstrate financial strength and reliability to meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?

#### § § 585.527

          BOEM may allow you to use your financial strength and reliability to meet financial assurance requirements if:

          (a) You have an investment grade issuer credit rating. If any Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-recognized NRSRO provides a credit rating that differs from any other SEC-recognized NRSRO credit rating, BOEM will apply the highest rating for the purposes of determining your financial assurance requirements.

          (b) You have a proxy credit rating determined by BOEM, which must be based on audited financial information for the most recent fiscal year (which must include an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the auditor's certificate).

          (1) The audited financial information for your most recent fiscal year must cover a continuous twelve-month period within the twenty-four-month period prior to the lessee's receipt of the determination that you must provide supplemental financial assurance.

          (2) In determining your proxy credit rating, BOEM may include the value of the offshore decommissioning liabilities associated with any lease(s) or grants in which you have an ownership interest. Upon BOEM's request, you must provide the information that BOEM determines is necessary to properly evaluate your offshore decommissioning liabilities, including joint ownership interests and liabilities associated with your OCS leases and grants.

          (c) Your co-lessee or co-grant-holder has an issuer credit rating or a proxy credit rating that meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; however, BOEM may require you to provide financial assurance for decommissioning obligations for which such co-lessee or co-grant-holder is not liable.

          (d) You have a contract with a counterparty that projects net income will exceed three times the estimated decommissioning expenses associated with the facilities that will generate that income.

          (e) If we approve your request to use your financial strength and reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements, you must submit annual updates.

          (f) If the annual updates do not continue to demonstrate financial strength and reliability or BOEM has reason to believe that you are unable to meet the requirements of this section, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, BOEM will terminate your ability to use financial strength and reliability for financial assurance and require you to provide another type of financial assurance. You must provide this new financial assurance instrument within 90 days after we terminate your use of financial strength and reliability.

          § 585.528   May I use a third-party guaranty to meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?

#### § § 585.528

          (a) You may use a third-party guaranty to secure all or part of the obligations for which financial assurance was demanded by BOEM if the guarantor:

          (1) Meets the credit rating or proxy credit rating criterion set forth in §  585.527(a); and

          (2) Submits an agreement containing each of the provisions in paragraph (d) of this section.

          (b) A third-party guarantor may limit its cumulative obligations to a fixed dollar amount as agreed to by BOEM at the time the third-party guaranty is provided.

          (c) If, during the life of your third-party guaranty, your guarantor no longer meets the criterion referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must:

          (1) Notify BOEM within 72 hours of so learning; and

          (2) Submit a surety bond or other financial assurance covering the obligations previously secured by the third-party guaranty.

          (d) Your guarantor must submit an agreement executed by the guarantor and all parties bound by the agreement. All parties are bound jointly and severally, and the guarantor must meet the legal and financial qualifications set forth in §§ 585.107 and 585.108.

          (1) When any party is a corporation, two corporate officers authorized to execute the guaranty agreement on behalf of the corporation must sign the agreement.

          (2) When any party is a partnership, joint venture, or syndicate, the guaranty agreement must bind each party who has a beneficial interest in your guarantor and provide that, upon BOEM demand under your guaranty, each party is jointly and severally liable for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease(s) or grant(s) covered by the agreement.

          (3) When forfeiture of the guaranty is called for, the agreement must provide that your guarantor will either bring your lease(s) or grant(s) into compliance or provide, within 7 days, sufficient funds to permit BOEM to complete corrective action.

          (4) The guaranty agreement must contain a confession of judgment, providing that, if BOEM determines that you or your operator is in default, the guarantor must not challenge the determination and must remedy the default.

          (5) If your guarantor wants to terminate the period of liability, your guarantor must notify you and BOEM at least 90 days before the proposed termination date, obtain BOEM's approval for termination of all or a specified portion of the guarantee for liabilities arising after that date, and remain liable for all your work performed during the period the agreement is in effect.

          (6) Each guaranty submitted pursuant to this section is deemed to contain all the terms described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, even if they are not actually in the agreement.

          (e) Before the termination of your guaranty, you must provide an acceptable replacement in the form of a bond or other security.

          § 585.529   Can I use a lease- or grant-specific decommissioning account to meet the financial assurance requirements related to decommissioning?

#### § § 585.529

          (a) In lieu of a surety bond, BOEM may authorize you to establish a lease-, ROW grant-, or RUE grant-specific decommissioning account in a federally insured institution. The funds may not be withdrawn from the account without our written approval.

          (1) The funds must be payable to BOEM and pledged to meet your lease or grant decommissioning and site clearance obligations;

          (2) You must fund the account in the amount determined by and according to the payment schedule approved by BOEM. BOEM will estimate the cost of decommissioning, including site clearance; and

          (3) Subject to BOEM's approval, a decommissioning account may be funded in whole or in part during the operations period of a lease or grant.

          (b) Any interest paid on the account will be treated as account funds unless we authorize in writing that any interest be paid to the depositor.

          (c) We may allow you to pledge Treasury securities, payable to BOEM on demand, to satisfy your obligation to make payments into the account. Acceptable Treasury securities and their collateral value are determined in accordance with 31 CFR part 203, Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at ).

          (d) We may require you to commit a specified stream of revenues as payment into the account so that the account will be fully funded, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The commitment may include revenue from other operations.

        Changes in Financial Assurance

          § 585.530   What must I do if my financial assurance lapses?

#### § § 585.530

          (a) If your surety is decertified by the Treasury, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or if your surety's charter or license is suspended or revoked, or if any other approved financial assurance expires for any reason, you must:

          (1) Inform BOEM within 3 business days about the financial assurance lapse; and

          (2) Provide new financial assurance in the amount set by BOEM, as provided in this subpart.

          (b) You must notify BOEM within 3 business days after you learn of any action filed alleging that you, your surety, or your third-party guarantor is insolvent or bankrupt.

          § 585.531   What happens if the value of my financial assurance is reduced?

#### § § 585.531

          If the value of your financial assurance is reduced below the required financial assurance amount because of a default or any other reason, you must provide additional financial assurance sufficient to meet the requirements of this subpart within 45 days or within a different period as specified by BOEM.

          § 585.532   What happens if my surety wants to terminate the period of liability of my financial assurance?

#### § § 585.532

          (a) Terminating the period of liability of your financial assurance ends the period during which surety liability continues to accrue. The surety continues to be responsible for obligations and liabilities that accrued during the period of liability and before the date on which BOEM terminates the period of liability under paragraph (b) of this section. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include:

          (1) Obligations that started to accrue before the beginning of the period of liability and have not been met; and

          (2) Obligations that began accruing during the period of liability.

          (b) Your surety must submit to BOEM its request to terminate the period of liability under its financial assurance and notify you of that request no less than 90 days before the proposed termination date. If you intend to continue activities on your lease or grant, you must provide replacement financial assurance of equivalent or greater value. BOEM will terminate that period of liability within 90 days after BOEM receives the request.

          § 585.533   How does my surety obtain cancellation of my financial assurance?

#### § § 585.533

          BOEM will allow a surety to cancel financial assurance and will relieve the surety from liability for accrued obligations on the earliest to occur of the following:

          (a) BOEM determines that there are no outstanding obligations covered by the financial assurance;

          (b) The following occurs:

          (1) BOEM accepts replacement financial assurance in an amount equal to or greater than the financial assurance to be cancelled to cover the period of liability prior to termination; or

          (2) The surety issuing the new financial assurance has expressly agreed to assume all outstanding liabilities under the original financial assurance that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and

          (c) Seven years have elapsed since the termination of the period of liability if the new surety did not assume the accrued obligations for the terminated period of liability, unless there are any appeals or judicial litigation related to your liabilities covered by the financial assurance.

          § 585.534   When may BOEM cancel my financial assurance?

#### § § 585.534

          (a) When your lease or grant ends, your sureties remain responsible, and BOEM will cancel your financial assurance as shown in the following table:

          (b) BOEM may require reinstatement of your financial assurance as if no cancellation had occurred if:

          (1) A person makes a payment under the lease or grant, and the payment is rescinded or must be repaid by the recipient because the person making the payment is insolvent, bankrupt, subject to reorganization, or placed in receivership; or

          (2) The responsible party represents to BOEM that it has discharged its obligations under the lease or grant, and the representation was materially false when the financial assurance was cancelled.

          § 585.535   Why might BOEM call for forfeiture of my financial assurance?

#### § § 585.535

          (a) BOEM may call for forfeiture of all or part of your financial assurance if:

          (1) After notice and demand for performance by BOEM, you refuse or fail, within the timeframe we prescribe, to comply with any term or condition of your lease or grant, other authorization or approval, or applicable regulations; or

          (2) You default on one of the conditions under which we accepted your financial assurance.

          (b) We may pursue forfeiture without first making demands for performance against any co-lessee or holder of an interest in your ROW or RUE, or other person approved to perform obligations under your lease or grant.

          § 585.536   How will I be notified of a call for forfeiture?

#### § § 585.536

          (a) BOEM will notify you and your surety, including any provider of financial assurance, in writing of the call for forfeiture and provide the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. We will base the amount upon an estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance.

          (b) We will advise you and your surety that you may avoid forfeiture if, within 10 business days:

          (1) You agree to and demonstrate in writing to BOEM that you will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, and you do so; or

          (2) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond.

          § 585.537   How will BOEM proceed once my bond or other security is forfeited?

#### § § 585.537

          (a) If BOEM determines that your bond or other security is forfeited, we will collect the forfeited amount and use the funds to bring your lease or grant(s) into compliance and correct any default.

          (b) If the amount collected under your bond or other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective action, BOEM may take or direct action to obtain full compliance and recover all costs in excess of the forfeited bond from you or any co-lessee or co-grantee.

          (c) If the amount collected under your bond or other security exceeds the full cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant(s) into compliance, we will return the excess funds to the party from whom the excess was collected.

#### § § 585.540

          (a) BOEM will distribute among the eligible coastal States 27 percent of the following revenues derived from qualified projects, where a qualified project and qualified project area is determined in § 585.541 and an eligible State is determined in § 585.542, where a qualified project and qualified project area are determined in 585.541 and an eligible State is defined in § 585.113. Revenues subject to distribution to eligible States include all bonuses, acquisition fees, rentals, and operating fees derived from the entire qualified project area and associated project easements and are not limited to revenues attributable to the portion of the project area within 3 miles of the seaward boundary of a coastal State. The revenues to be shared do not include administrative fees such as service fees and those assessed for civil penalties and forfeiture of bond or other surety obligations.

          (b) The project area is the area included within a single lease or grant. For each qualified project, BOEM will determine and announce the project area and its geographic center at the time it grants or issues a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the OCS. If a qualified project lease or grant's boundaries change significantly due to actions pursuant to § 585.435 or § 585.436, BOEM will re-evaluate the project area to determine whether the geographic center has changed. If it has, BOEM will re-determine State eligibility and shares accordingly.

          (c) To determ**i**ne each eligible State's share of the 27 percent of the revenues for a qualified project, BOEM will use the inverse distance formula, which apportions shares according to the relative proximity of the nearest point on the coastline of each eligible State to the geographic center of the qualified project area. If S is equal to the nearest distance from the geographic center of the project area to the i = 1, 2, * * * nth eligible State's coastline, then eligible State i would be entitled to the fraction F of the 27-percent aggregate revenue share due to all the eligible States according to the following formula:

          Formula 1 to paragraph (c)

          § 585.541   What is a qualified project for revenue sharing purposes?

#### § § 585.541

          A qualified project for the purpose of revenue sharing with eligible coastal States is one authorized under subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act, which includes acreage within the area extending 3 miles seaward of State submerged lands. A qualified project is subject to revenue sharing with those States that are eligible for revenue sharing under § 585.542. The entire area within a lease or grant for the qualified project, excluding project easements, is considered the qualified project area.

          § 585.542   What makes a State eligible for payment of revenues?

#### § § 585.542

          A State is eligible for payment of revenues if any part of the State's coastline is located within 15 miles of the announced geographic center of the project area of a qualified project. A State is not eligible for revenue sharing if all parts of that State's coastline are more than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area. This is the case even if the qualified project area is located wholly or partially within an area extending 3 miles seaward of the submerged lands of that State or if there are no States with a coastline less than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area.

          § 585.543   Example of how the inverse distance formula works.

#### § § 585.543

          (a) Assume that the geographic center of the project area lies 12 miles from the closest coastline point of State A and 4 miles from the closest coastline point of State B. BOEM will round dollar shares to the nearest whole dollar. The proportional share due each State would be calculated as follows:

          (1) State A's share = [(1/12) ÷ (1/12 + 1/4)] = 1/4.

          (2) State B's share = [(1/4) ÷ (1/12 + 1/4)] = 3/4.

          (b) Therefore, State B would receive a share of revenues that is three times as large as that awarded to State A, based on the finding that State B's nearest coastline is one-third the distance to the geographic center of the qualified project area as compared to State A's nearest coastline. Eligible States share the 27 percent of the total revenues from the qualified project as mandated under the OCS Lands Act. Hence, if the qualified project generates $1,000,000 of Federal revenues in a given year, the Federal Government would distribute the States' 27-percent share as follows:

          (1) State A's share = $270,000 × 1/4 = $67,500.

          (2) State B's share = $270,000 × 3/4 = $202,500.

        (a) BOEM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis under the procedures in this section with regard to any application or request under this part if we decide at any time that the preparation of a particular document or study is necessary for the application or request and it will have a unique processing cost, such as the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS).

        (1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through BOEM.

        (2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing costs.

        (b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual application or request according to the following procedures:

        (1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing costs.

        (2) You may comment on the proposed fee.

        (3) You may:

        (i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for processing your application or request; or

        (ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any document, study, or other activity.

        (4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your comments and any BOEM-approved work you will do.

        (i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount of money that we did not spend on processing costs.

        (5)(i) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the date payment is due.

        (ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without our prior written approval.

        (6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final document or take final action on your application or request.

        (7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under protest while the appeal is pending.

          (a) We will establish on a case-by-case basis, and set forth in the Alternate Use RUE, the length of time for which you are authorized to conduct activities approved in your Alternate Use RUE instrument.

          (b) In establishing this term, BOEM will consider the size and scale of the proposed alternate use activities, the type of alternate use activities, and any other relevant considerations.

          (c) BOEM may authorize renewal of Alternate Use RUEs at its discretion.

          § 586.211   What payments are required for an Alternate Use RUE?

#### § § 586.211

          We will establish rental or other payments for an Alternate Use RUE on a case-by-case basis, as set forth in the Alternate Use RUE grant, depending on our assessment of the following factors:

          (a) The effect on the original OCS Lands Act approved activity;

          (b) The size and scale of the proposed alternate use activities;

          (c) The income, if any, expected to be generated from the proposed alternate use activities; and

          (d) The type of alternate use activities.

          § 586.212   What financial assurance is required for an Alternate Use RUE?

#### § § 586.212

          (a) The holder of an Alternate Use RUE will be required to secure financial assurances in an amount determined by BOEM that is sufficient to cover all obligations under the Alternate Use RUE, including decommissioning obligations, and must retain such financial assurance amounts until all obligations have been fulfilled, as determined by BOEM.

          (b) We may revise financial assurance amounts, as necessary, to ensure that there is sufficient financial assurance to secure all obligations under the Alternate Use RUE.

          (c) We may reduce the amount of the financial assurance that you must retain if it is not necessary to cover existing obligations under the Alternate Use RUE.

          § 586.213   Is an Alternate Use RUE assignable?

#### § § 586.213

          (a) BOEM may authorize assignment of an Alternate Use RUE.

          (b) To request assignment of an Alternate Use RUE, you must submit a written request for assignment that includes the following information:

          (1) BOEM-assigned Alternate Use RUE number;

          (2) The names of both the assignor and the assignee, if applicable;

          (3) The names and telephone numbers of the contacts for both the assignor and the assignee;

          (4) The names, titles, and signatures of the authorizing officials for both the assignor and the assignee;

          (5) A statement affirming that the owner of the existing OCS facility and lessee of the lease in which the facility is located approve of the proposed assignment and assignee;

          (6) A statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Alternate Use RUE;

          (7) Evidence required by § 586.108 that the assignee satisfies the requirements of § 586.107; and

          (8) A statement on how the assignee will comply with the financial assurance requirements set forth in the Alternate Use RUE.

          (c) The assignment takes effect on the date we approve your request.

          (d) The assignor is liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE before the date we approve your assignment request. An assignment approval by BOEM does not relieve the assignor of liability for accrued obligations that the assignee, or a subsequent assignee, fails to perform.

          (e) The assignee and each subsequent assignee are liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE after the date we approve the assignment request.

          § 586.214   When will BOEM suspend an Alternate Use RUE?

          (b) We will not approve your relinquishment request until you have paid all outstanding rentals (or other payments) and fines.

          (c) The relinquishment takes effect on the date we approve your request.

          § 586.216   When will an Alternate Use RUE be cancelled?

#### § § 590.2

        If you are adversely affected by a BOEM official's final decision or order issued under chapter V of this title, you may appeal that decision or order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). Your appeal must conform with the procedures found in this subpart and 43 CFR part 4, subpart E. A request for reconsideration of a BOEM decision concerning a lease bid, authorized in § 556.517(b), § 581.21(a)(2), or § 585.118(c)(1) of this chapter, is not subject to the procedures found in this part.

        (a) A written Notice of Appeal, together with a copy of the decision or order you are appealing, in the office of the BOEM officer that issued the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and

        (b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of Appeal.

        (1) You must pay electronically through the  page on the BOEM Web site at  and you must include a copy of the  confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.

        (2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the processing fee.

        (c) You may file an appeal of a BOEM supplemental financial assurance demand with the IBLA. However, if you request that the IBLA stay the demand pending a final ruling on your appeal, you must post an appeal surety bond equal to the amount of the demand that you seek to stay before any such stay is effective.

        § 590.7   Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my appeal is pending?

#### § § 590.7

        (a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under § 590.3 unless:

        (1) BOEM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or

        (2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 550.1409 pending the appeal challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.

        (c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or order under appeal.

> [76 FR 64623, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended by 89 FR 31598, Apr. 24, 2024]
