  PART 300 [RESERVED]

### Part 300

  PART 301—PUBLIC ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

### Part 301

**Authority:** Authority: E.O. 12356, 43 FR 14874 dated April 2, 1982.

**Source:** Source: 49 FR 13692, Apr. 6, 1984, unless otherwise noted.

    § 301.1   Introduction.

#### § § 301.1

    The following regulations implement Executive Order 12356 and provide guidance for members of the public desiring a review for declassification of a document of the Peace Corps.

    § 301.2   Requests for mandatory declassification review.

#### § § 301.2

    (a) All information originally classified by the Peace Corps shall be subject to review for declassification.

    (b) Requests for review of such information for declassification shall be in writing, addressed to the Peace Corps Director of Security, Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526, and reasonably describe the information sought with sufficient specificity to enable its location with a reasonable amount of effort. Only requests made by a United States citizen or a permanent resident alien, a Federal agency or a State or local government will be considered.

    (c) Requests relating to information, either derivatively classified by the Peace Corps or originally classified by another agency but in the possession of the Peace Corps, shall be forwarded, together with a copy of the record, to the originating agency. The transmittal may contain in Peace Corps recommendation for action.

    § 301.3   Action on requests for declassification review.

#### § § 301.3

    (a) The Director of Security shall present each request for declassification to the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee, which shall consist of the Associate Director for International Operations, the Associate Director for Management and the General Counsel, or their designees, together with his or her recommendation for action.

    (b) Every effort will be made to complete action on each request within 60 days of receipt thereof.

    (c) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. If the Classification Review Committee determines that the material for which review is requested no longer requires this protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the requester unless withholding is otherwise authorized by law.

    (d) If the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee determines that requested information must remain classified, the requester shall be given prompt notice of the decision and, if possible, a brief explanation of why the information cannot be declassified.

    (e) The Peace Corps may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classified under E.O. 12356.

    (f) A requester may appeal a refusal to declassify information to the Director of the Peace Corps, or the Director's designee. Appeals shall be in writing, addressed to the Director of the Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526, and shall briefly state the reasons why the requester believes that the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee decision is in error. Appeals must be submitted within 30 days after receipt of notice of the Classification Review Committee decision. The decision of the Peace Corps Director, or designee, will be based on the entire record, and will be rendered in writing within 60 days after receipt of an appeal. The decision of the Director or Director's designee is the final Peace Corps action on a request.

  PART 303—PROCEDURES FOR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT

### Part 303

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301, 552, 552a, 553; 22 U.S.C. 2501  31 U.S.C. 3717.

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66008, Nov. 25, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    § 303.1   Purpose.

#### § § 303.1

    This part sets out the rules and procedures the Peace Corps follows in making records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

    § 303.2   Definitions.

#### § § 303.2

    means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester has made a commercial use request, the Peace Corps will look to the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. When the Peace Corps has reasonable cause to doubt the requester's stated use of the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, it will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a category.

    means:

    (1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

    (2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Peace Corps or Federal Government activity and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; or

    (3) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Peace Corps' or the Federal Government's integrity which affect public confidence.

    means commercial or financial information obtained by the Peace Corps from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

    are those expenses that the Peace Corps incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work ( the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. _Direct costs_ do not include overhead expenses, such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

    means the process of making a copy of a record requested pursuant to this part. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable electronic documents, among others.

    means any school or undergraduate, graduate, professional, or vocational institute that operates a program or programs of scholarly research, or any member of the same (including faculty or students) who seeks records in pursuit of their role at the educational institution.

    means the process set forth in the FOIA that allows requesters to ask for expedited processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a compelling need.

    means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.

    means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.

    means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.

    mean those records as defined generally in this section which originated with or are in the possession and control of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Peace Corps which have been compiled for law enforcement, audit, and investigative functions and/or any other purpose authorized under the IG Act of 1978, as amended.

    as set forth in the Federal _Records_ Act of 1950, as amended, at 44 U.S.C. 3301, and in any other applicable federal statute ( the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended).

    is any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.

    means one of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, including commercial requesters, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.

    means the process of examining a document located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of such document is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any such document for disclosure. _Review_ does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    means the process of looking for and retrieving records that are responsive to a request for records. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. _Search_es may be conducted manually or by automated means and will be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner. If the agency cannot identify the requested records after a 2 hour search, it can determine that the records were not adequately described and ask the requester to provide a more specific request.

    means any person or entity, including a corporation, state, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

    as used in this part, mean circumstances attending a request for information and are limited to the following, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for the proper processing of the particular request:

    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from offices or locations that are separate from the office processing the request;

    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency or organization having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more offices of the Peace Corps having a substantial subject matter interest therein.

    is an official who has been granted authority as the FOIA Officer who may deny FOIA requests of the Peace Corps based on one or more of the nine categories of exemptions from mandatory disclosure. An IDA also: denies a fee category claim by a requester; denies a request for expedited processing due to demonstrated compelling need; denies a request for a waiver or reduction of fees; reviews a fee estimate; and confirms that no records were located in response to a request.

    § 303.3   Policy.

#### § § 303.3

    (a) The Peace Corps will administer the FOIA with a presumption of openness. The Peace Corps will make its records concerning its operations, activities, and business available to the public, consistent with the requirements of the FOIA. The agency will also consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever it determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible. This includes taking reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information.

    (b) Records that the FOIA requires agencies to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Peace Corps' website. The Peace Corps FOIA Office is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available (including frequently requested records), identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Peace Corps will ensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. The Peace Corps has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records.

    (c) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(8), the Peace Corps may make discretionary disclosures of records or information, without a formal FOIA request and that may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption and disclosure is not prohibited by law. However, this policy does not create any enforceable right in a court of law or any other tribunal.

    (d) Requests for records of the Office of Inspector General (OIG records), as defined in § 303.2, and appeals from denials of requests for OIG records are subject to this policy and will be granted or denied consistent with § 303.10(b) through (c) through their own FOIA adjudication process.

> [89 FR 25523, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.4   Records published in the Federal Register.

#### § § 303.4

    The Peace Corps publishes its notices and substantive regulations in the  It also publishes information on its basic structure and operations necessary to inform the public how to deal effectively with the Peace Corps in the  a special publication of the  The Peace Corps will make reasonable efforts to currently update such information, which includes information on Peace Corps' location and functions, and how the public may obtain information or forms, or make submittals or requests. The Peace Corps' published regulations are at 22 CFR Chapter III.

    § 303.5   FOIA Library.

#### § § 303.5

    (a) The public reading room is no longer physically available. The Peace Corps makes information available to the public electronically through the Peace Corps' FOIA Library on its public website at

    (b) Subject to the limitation stated in paragraph (c) of this section, the following records will be made available in the FOIA Library:

    (1) All final public opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders issued in the adjudication of cases that involve the Peace Corps;

    (2) Statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the Peace Corps that are not published in the ;

    (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to the staff that affect the public;

    (4) Copies of frequently requested records, regardless of form or format, with a general index of such records:

    (i) Released to any person in response to a public request for records which the Peace Corps determines are likely to become subject to subsequent requests for substantially the same records or

    (ii) For which there have been 3 or more requests;

    (5) The index required by § 303.6; and

    (6) Other records the Peace Corps has determined are of general interest to members of the public in understanding activities of the Peace Corps or in dealing with the Peace Corps in connection with those activities.

    (c) Records required by the FOIA to be available in the FOIA Library may be exempt from mandatory disclosure pursuant to section 552(b) of the FOIA. Such records will not be made available in the FOIA Library. Other records maintained in the FOIA Library may be edited by the redaction of information protected under section 552(b) of the FOIA. The extent of the redaction shall be indicated, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the redaction is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the redaction shall be indicated at the place in the record where the redaction was made.

    (d) Records required by the FOIA to be maintained shall be made available in the Peace Corps' electronic FOIA Library.

    (e) Most public electronic records will also be made available to the public on the Peace Corps website at

> [89 FR 25523, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.6   Index of records.

#### § § 303.6

    The Peace Corps will maintain a current index identifying any matter within the scope of § 303.4 or § 303.5(b)(1) through (5). The index will be maintained and made available for public inspection and copying at the Peace Corps' headquarters in Washington, DC. The cost of a copy of the index will not exceed the standard charge for duplication set out in § 303.13(e). The Peace Corps will also make the index available on its public Web site.

    § 303.7   Requests for records.

#### § § 303.7

    (a) Except for records required by the FOIA to be published in the  or to be made available in the FOIA Library, Peace Corps records will be made promptly available, upon request, to any person in accordance with this section, unless it is determined that such records should be withheld and are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.

    (b) Requests for records under this section shall be:

    (1) Made in writing, shall include the name of the requester, and the envelope, email, and/or the letter shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Request.” All such requests shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer. Requests by letter shall be directed to Peace Corps FOIA Officer, 1275 First Street NE, Washington DC 20526. Requests by email shall be directed to  Any request not marked and addressed as specified in this paragraph will be so marked by Peace Corps personnel as soon as it is properly identified and will be forwarded immediately to the FOIA Officer. A request improperly addressed will not be deemed to have been received for purposes of the time period set out in paragraph (h) of this section until it has been received by the FOIA Officer. Upon receipt of an improperly addressed request, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the date on which the time period began. All paper requests shall be stamped “received” on the date it is received by the FOIA Officer. Electronic requests are deemed to be “received” on the date in which the FOIA Officer acknowledges receipt.

    (2) A request must reasonably describe the records requested so that employees of the Peace Corps who are familiar with the subject area of the request are able, with a reasonable amount of effort, to determine which particular records are within the scope of the request. If it is determined that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the requester shall be so informed and provided an opportunity to confer with Peace Corps personnel in order to attempt to reformulate the request in a manner that will meet the needs of the requester and the requirements of this paragraph (b).

    (c) The Peace Corps requires that first-party requesters provide the following information so that the Peace Corps can protect the personal information found in its files and ensure that records are disclosed only to the proper persons: the requester's full name, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien status, date and place of birth (city, state, and country), and a copy of a photo ID. A first-party request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 as a substitute for notarization. A requester may request this penalty of perjury statement from the FOIA office to complete for submission.

    (d) To facilitate the location of records by the Peace Corps, a requester should try to provide the following kinds of information, if known:

    (1) The specific event or action to which the record refers;

    (2) The unit or program of the Peace Corps which may be responsible for or may have produced the record;

    (3) The date of the record or the date or period to which it refers or relates;

    (4) The type of record, such as an application, a particular form, a contract, or a report;

    (5) Personnel of the Peace Corps who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record; or

    (6) Citations to newspapers or publications which have referred to the record.

    (e) The Peace Corps is not required to create a record or to perform research to satisfy a request.

    (f) Any request for a waiver or reduction of fees should be included in the FOIA request, and any such request should indicate the grounds for a waiver or reduction of fees, as set out in § 303.16(k).

    (g) The Peace Corps will provide records in the form or format indicated by the requester to the extent such records are readily reproducible in the requested form or format.

    (h)(1) The FOIA Officer or OIG FOIA Officer, upon request for any records made in accordance with this section, shall make an initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and dispatch such determination to the requester within 20 business days after receipt of such request, except for unusual circumstances, as defined in § 303.2, in which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10 business days by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.

    (2) If the FOIA Officer determines that a request or portion thereof is for OIG records, the FOIA Officer shall promptly refer the request or portion thereof to the OIG FOIA Officer and send notice of such action to the requester. In such case, the OIG FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and dispatch such determination to the requester within 20 business days after receipt of such request, except for unusual circumstances, in which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10 business days by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.

    (i) If a request is particularly broad or complex so that it cannot be completed within the time periods stated in paragraph (h) of this section, the Peace Corps may ask the requester to narrow the request or agree to an additional delay.

    (j) When no determination can be dispatched within the applicable time limit, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and the requester's right to treat the delay as a denial and to appeal to the Associate Director for the Office of Management or the Inspector General, in accordance with § 303.13. If no determination has been dispatched by the end of the 20-day period, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem the request denied, and exercise a right of appeal in accordance with § 303.13. The FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer may ask the requester to forego an appeal until a determination is made.

    (k) After it has been determined that a request will be granted, the responsible official will act with due diligence in providing a prompt response.

    (l)(1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever the requester demonstrates a compelling need as defined in § 303.2.

    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt determination, a request for expedited processing must be properly addressed and marked and received by the Peace Corps pursuant to § 303.7(b).

    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement demonstrating a compelling need, as defined in § 303.2, that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.

    (4) Within 10 business days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall decide whether to grant the request and shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.

    (5) Appeals regarding expedited processing denials shall be made to the Associate Director for the Office of Management, or in the case of a denial by the OIG FOIA Officer of a request for expedited processing, the Inspector General, who shall respond within 10 business days of receipt of the appeal.

    § 303.8   Timing of responses to requests.

#### § § 303.8

    (a)  The Peace Corps ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. The response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the Peace Corps' FOIA Officer or by the OIG FOIA Officer.

    (b)  The Peace Corps designates a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The Peace Corps may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Peace Corps may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Peace Corps will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

    (c)  Whenever the Peace Corps cannot meet the time limit for processing a request because of unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2 and the Peace Corps extends the time limit on that basis, the Peace Corps will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Peace Corps estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Peace Corps will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Peace Corps will make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Peace Corps FOIA Public Liaison is identified on the agency's FOIA Open Government web page  and is available at  The Peace Corps will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.

    (d)  To address unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2, the Peace Corps may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Peace Corps will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

    (e)  (1) The Peace Corps will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve a compelling need as defined in § 303.2.

    (2) A request for expedited processing of a request for information may be made at any time and submitted to the Peace Corps FOIA Officer or to the OIG FOIA Officer in the case of a request concerning OIG records. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the Associate Director for the Office of Management, or in the case of an appeal concerning OIG records, the Inspector General.

    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing will submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, in § 303.2, paragraph (2) of the definition for compelling need, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject may be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Peace Corps may waive the formal certification requirement.

    (4) The Peace Corps will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Peace Corps will act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.

    § 303.9   Exemptions for withholding records.

#### § § 303.9

    (a) The Peace Corps may withhold information in part or in its entirety using FOIA exemptions listed in 5 U.S.C. 552 (b), when the Initial Denial Authority (IDA) reasonably foresees that the disclosure of such information would cause harm to an interest protected by the exemption or exemptions, or if disclosure is prohibited by law. The Peace Corps will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. The Peace Corps may withhold a requested record from public disclosure only if the record fits within one or more of the following FOIA exemptions:

    (1) Matter specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and is in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;

    (2) Matter which is related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Peace Corps;

    (3) Matter which is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than exemptions under FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or establishes particular criteria for withholding, or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Peace Corps, except that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes including enforcing the Peace Corps Act or any other law, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:

    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;

    (ii) Would deprive a person or a recipient of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis; and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;

    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or

    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.

    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

    (b) In the event that one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (a) of this section apply, any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to the requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt. The Peace Corps shall indicate, if technically feasible, the precise amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made at the place in the record where the deletion is made, and indicate the exemption under which a deletion is made on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption. At the discretion of the Peace Corps officials authorized to grant or deny a request for records, it may be possible to provide a requester with:

    (1) A summary of information in the exempt portion of a record; or

    (2) An oral description of the exempt portion of a record.

    (c) No requester shall have a right to insist that any or all of the techniques in paragraph (b) of this section should be employed in order to satisfy a request.

    (d) Records that may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be made available at the discretion of the Peace Corps.

    (e) (1) It is the policy of the Peace Corps to withhold proprietary information that falls within the protection of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Proprietary information includes trade secrets, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

    (2) It is also the policy of the Peace Corps to give submitters of arguably proprietary information an adequate opportunity to provide information to the Peace Corps to establish that the information constitutes protected proprietary information.

    (3) A person submitting arguably proprietary information to the Peace Corps will be notified in writing by the Peace Corps if there is a FOIA request for the information, unless:

    (i) The Peace Corps has already decided that the information should be withheld;

    (ii) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public; or

    (iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law.

    (4) The notice shall afford the submitter at least ten business days in which to object to the disclosure of any requested information. Whenever the Peace Corps provides such notice to the submitter, it shall also notify the requester that notice and an opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter.

    (5) A submitter's request for protection for information under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall:

    (i) Specifically identify the exact material claimed to be confidential proprietary information;

    (ii) State whether the information identified has ever been released to a person who is not in a confidential relationship with the submitter;

    (iii) State the basis for the submitter's belief that the information is not commonly known or readily ascertainable by outside persons; and

    (iv) State how release of the information would cause harm to the submitter's competitive position.

    (6) The Peace Corps shall consider the submitter's objections and specific grounds for non-disclosure when deciding whether to disclose the information. If the Peace Corps decides to disclose the information, it shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the submitter at least ten business days notice of its decision before the information is disclosed and a statement of its reasons for not sustaining the objection to disclosure. Whenever the Peace Corps notifies the submitter of its final decision, it shall also notify the requester.

    (7) Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of proprietary information, the Peace Corps shall promptly notify the submitter.

    (f) The IDA may also withhold information applicable under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k) when the records are managed within a system of records; see 22 CFR part 308.

    § 303.10   Responsibilities and authorities.

#### § § 303.10

    (a)  The General Counsel (GC) shall furnish legal advice to Peace Corps officials and staff as to their obligations under this part and shall take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to assure a consistent and equitable application of the provisions of this part by and within the Peace Corps. The OIG Legal Counsel will coordinate with GC, as appropriate and necessary, when furnishing legal advice to the OIG FOIA Officer and Inspector General.

    (b)  The FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny requests for records, except for OIG records, under this part. The OIG FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny requests for OIG records under this part. The FOIA Officer and the OIG FOIA Officer shall consult with each other when a request includes both Peace Corps and OIG records in order to ensure consistency and lack of duplication in processing the request.

    (c)  The Associate Director for the Office of Management is authorized to grant or deny appeals under § 303.13(a) through (c) except in the case of appeals from denials of requests for OIG records. The Inspector General is authorized to grant or deny appeals under § 303.13(a) through (c) from denials of requests for OIG records. Both the Associate Director for the Office of Management and the Inspector General shall follow this part in processing appeals.

    (d)(1)  When the Peace Corps receives a request for a record in its possession that it has received from another agency, it shall determine whether the other agency is better qualified to decide whether the record is exempt from disclosure and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of discretion. If the Peace Corps determines it is better qualified to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the Peace Corps determines it is not better qualified to process the request, it shall either:

    (i) Consult with the other agency before responding to the request; or

    (ii) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request for the record to the other agency (but only if the agency is subject to FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.

    (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

    (i) Whenever the Peace Corps receives a request for a record containing information that relates to an investigation of a possible violation of law that was originated by another agency, the Peace Corps will either consult with the other agency before responding or refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the other agency; and

    (ii) Whenever a request is made for a record containing information that has been classified by another agency or may be appropriate for classification under Executive Order 13525 or any other executive order concerning the classification of records, the Peace Corps shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, should consider the information for classification, or has the primary interest in the information, as appropriate.

    (3)  Whenever the Peace Corps refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred and the part of the request that has been referred and provide the requester with a point of contact within the receiving agency to whom the requester can speak regarding the referral.

    (4)  All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date the FOIA request was initially received by the Peace Corps.

    (5)  The Peace Corps may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.

> [68 FR 66008, Nov. 25, 2003, as amended at 79 FR 19819, Apr. 10, 2014; 89 FR 25525, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.11   Responses to requests.

#### § § 303.11

    (a)  The Peace Corps, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the internet electronically, such as email or web portal.

    (b)  The Peace Corps will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Peace Corps will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

    (c)  Upon request, the Peace Corps will provide an estimated date by which the Peace Corps expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the Peace Corps may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.

    (d)  Once the Peace Corps determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The Peace Corps will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 303.16 and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Peace Corps will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

    (e)  If the Peace Corps makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.

    (f)  The Peace Corps will release any reasonably segregable portion of a record after redaction of the exempt portions. The amount of information redacted and the exemption under which the redaction is made shall be indicated on the released portion of the record unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information redacted will also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.

    (g)  (1) In the event that the Peace Corps identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Peace Corps will confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), prior to application of the exclusion.

    (2) The Peace Corps, when invoking an exclusion, should document its consultation with OIP.

> [89 FR 25525, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.12   Denials.

#### § § 303.12

    (a) A denial of a written request for a record or information that complies with the requirements of § 303.7 shall be in writing and shall include, as applicable:

    (1) The name and title or position of the responsible IDA;

    (2) The signature of the agency's FOIA Officer, or in the case of denials of requests concerning OIG records, the signature of the Inspector General or designee;

    (3) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied in denying the request;

    (4) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by redactions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

    (5) For any information denied under Exemption 3, the specific statute relied upon to deny the information along with a short description of the statute;

    (6) A statement that the requester must appeal no later than 90 days after the date of the denial and along with instructions on how to appeal to the appellate authority. The instructions will include the appellate authority's duty title, the mailing address for the appeal, and instructions on how the requester can appeal electronically; as defined under § 303.13; and

    (7) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Peace Corps' FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.

    (b) [Reserved]

> [89 FR 25525, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.13   Appeals.

#### § § 303.13

    (a)  A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the Associate Director of the Office of Management or, in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 303.11(e). Requesters can submit appeals by mail or online in accordance with the following requirements or with those on the Peace Corps' website. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the Peace Corps' determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

    (b)  (1) The Associate Director of the Office of Management or designee, or in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General or designee, will consider all appeals under this section.

    (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

    (3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Associate Director of the Office of Management, or in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General, will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.

    (c)  The Associate Director of the Office of Management or designee, or in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General or designee, will provide the decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds a determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the OGIS of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the Associate Director of the Office of Management or designee, or in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General or designee, will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The Associate Director of the Office of Management or designee, or in the case of a denial of a request for OIG records, the Inspector General or designee, will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.

    (d)  Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Peace Corps agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

    (e)  Before seeking review by a court of a Peace Corps' adverse determination, a requester generally will first submit a timely administrative appeal.

    § 303.14   Confidential commercial information.

#### § § 303.14

    (a)  A submitter of confidential commercial information as defined in § 303.2 will use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

    (b)  (1) The Peace Corps will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if the Peace Corps determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

    (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

    (ii) The Peace Corps has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but it has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

    (2) The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the Peace Corps may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.

    (c)  The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

    (1) The Peace Corps determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, the Peace Corps will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

    (d)  (1) The Peace Corps will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter may respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Peace Corps a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter will explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is commercially confidential.

    (3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The Peace Corps is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this part may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

    (e)  The Peace Corps will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

    (f)  Whenever the Peace Corps decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Peace Corps will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

    (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

    (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the Peace Corps intends to release them; and

    (3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time after the notice.

    (g)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Peace Corps will promptly notify the submitter.

    (h)  The Peace Corps will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

> [89 FR 25526, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.15   Preservation of records.

#### § § 303.15

    The Peace Corps will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Peace Corps will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.

> [89 FR 25527, Apr. 11, 2024]

    § 303.16   Fees.

#### § § 303.16

    (a)  The Peace Corps will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the Guidelines of OMB. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

    (1) Commercial use requesters;

    (2) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

    (3) All other requesters.

    (b)  Different fees are assessed depending on the requester category and approved by the FOIA Officer. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The Peace Corps will consider individual requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (l) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, Peace Corps may contact a requester for additional information. The Peace Corps will ensure that searches, reviews, and duplications are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Peace Corps ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters will pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by the Peace Corps.

    (c)  (1) Whether the request is a commercial use request as defined in § 303.2. The Peace Corps' decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Peace Corps will notify requesters of their placement in this category.

    (2) The sum of direct costs as defined in § 303.2.

    (3) The cost of duplication as defined in § 303.2.

    (4) Whether the requester is an educational institution as defined in § 303.2. A requester in this fee category will show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. The Peace Corps may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research, and the Peace Corps will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

    A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.

    A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.

    A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.

    (5) Whether the requester is a noncommercial scientific institution as defined in § 303.2. A requester in this category will show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. The Peace Corps will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

    (6) Whether the requester is a representative of the news media as defined in § 303.2. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Peace Corps may also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The Peace Corps will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

    (7) The cost of the review as defined in § 303.2. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 303.14, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    (8) The cost of the time involved in the search as defined in § 303.2. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

    (d)  In responding to FOIA requests, the Peace Corps will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (l) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided under paragraph (m) of this section already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Peace Corps will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

    (1)  (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. The Peace Corps will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. The Peace Corps may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged.

    (iii) The Peace Corps will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. The Peace Corps will notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester will agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

    (iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by the Peace Corps at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), agencies will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

    (2)  The Peace Corps will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. The Peace Corps will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the Peace Corps can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the Peace Corps will provide one copy per request at no charge up to 100 pages. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Peace Corps will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents will be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester will also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the Peace Corps will charge the direct costs.

    (3)  The Peace Corps will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by the Peace Corps to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Peace Corps' re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (e)  (1) When the Peace Corps determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.

    (2)(i) If the Peace Corps fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in (e)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

    (ii) If the Peace Corps has determined that unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2 apply and the Peace Corps provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

    (iii) If the Peace Corps has determined that unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2 apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Peace Corps may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken: the Peace Corps will have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and the Peace Corps will have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Peace Corps may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

    (iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

    (3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

    (4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Peace Corps will provide without charge:

    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

    (ii) The first 2 hours of search.

    (5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first 2 hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.

    (f)  (1) When the Peace Corps determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Peace Corps will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Peace Corps will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, 2 hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

    (2) If the Peace Corps notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester will provide the commitment or designation in writing, and will, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Peace Corps will not accept payments in installments.

    (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Peace Corps estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Peace Corps will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Peace Corps will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

    (4) The Peace Corps will make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

    (g)  Although not required to provide special services, if the Peace Corps chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

    (h)  The Peace Corps may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

    (i)  When the Peace Corps reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Peace Corps may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Peace Corps may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Peace Corps will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

    (j)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section, the Peace Corps may not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

    (2) When the Peace Corps determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Peace Corps may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the Peace Corps within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Peace Corps may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Peace Corps may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Peace Corps begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Peace Corps has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

    (4) In cases in which the Peace Corps requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Peace Corps' fee determination, the request will be closed.

    (k)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Peace Corps to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Peace Corps will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

    (l)  (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

    (2) The Peace Corps will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:

    (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request will concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated; and

    (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

    (A) Disclosure of the requested records will be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding; and

    (B) The disclosure will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. The Peace Corps will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

    (iii) The disclosure will not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Peace Corps will consider the following criteria:

    (A) The Peace Corps will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration; and

    (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Peace Corps will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Peace Corps ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors of paragraphs (l)(2)(i) and (ii), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

    (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.

    (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Peace Corps and should address the criteria referenced under paragraph (1) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

    (5) These fee waiver/reduction provisions are subject to appeal in the same manner as appeals from denial under § 303.13.

    (m)  No fee will be charged under this section unless the cost of routine collection and processing of the fee payment is likely to exceed the average cost of processing a payment.

    (n)  Requesters must agree to pay all fees charged for services associated with their requests.

    (o)  Interest may be charged to those requesters who fail to pay the fees charged. Interest will be assessed on the amount billed, starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The rate charged will be as prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

    (p)  The Peace Corps is not required to process a request for a requester who has not paid FOIA fees owed to another Federal agency.

    (q)  The Peace Corps reserves the right to charge for multiple copies of any document that will be provided to any one requester or to require that special arrangements for duplication be made in the case of bound volumes or other records representing unusual problems of handling or reproduction.

    § 303.17   Procedures for responding to a subpoena.

#### § § 303.17

    (a)  (1) This section sets forth the procedures to be followed in proceedings in which the Peace Corps is not a party, whenever a subpoena, order, or other demand (collectively referred to as a “demand”) of a court or other authority is issued for:

    (i) The production or disclosure of any material contained in the files of the Peace Corps;

    (ii) The production or disclosure of any information relating to material contained in the files of the Peace Corps;

    (iv) The production of an employee of the Peace Corps for the deposition or an appearance as a witness in a legal action or proceeding.

    (2) For purposes of this section, the term “employee of the Peace Corps” includes all officers, employees, volunteers, and trainees of the Peace Corps appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction or, control of, the Director of the Peace Corps, including personal services contractors. Also, for purposes of this section, records of the Peace Corps do not include records of the Office of Inspector General.

    (3) This section is intended to provide instructions regarding the internal operations of the Peace Corps, and is not intended, and does not and may not be relied upon, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the Peace Corps.

    (4) This section applies to:

    (i) State and local court, administrative and legislative proceedings; and

    (ii) Federal court and administrative proceedings.

    (5) This section does not apply to:

    (i) Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony or documents; and

    (ii) Employees or former employees making appearances solely in their private capacity in legal or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Peace Corps (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents or domestic relations). Any questions regarding whether the appearance relates solely to the employee's or former employee's private capacity should be referred to the Office of the General Counsel.

    (6) Nothing in this section otherwise permits disclosure of information by the Peace Corps except as is provided by statute or other applicable law.

    (b)  (1) No employee or former employee of the Peace Corps shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority set forth in paragraph (a) of this section produce any material, disclose any information, or appear in any proceeding, described in paragraph (a) of this section without the approval of the General Counsel or designee.

    (2) Whenever an employee or former employee of the Peace Corps receives a demand for the production of material or the disclosure of information described in paragraph (a) of this section they shall immediately notify and provide a copy of the demand to the General Counsel or designee. The General Counsel, or designee, shall be furnished by the party causing the demand to be issued or served a written summary of the information sought, its relevance to the proceeding in connection with which it was served, and why the information sought is unavailable by any other means or from any other sources.

    (3) The General Counsel, or designee, in consultation with appropriate Peace Corps officials, including the Peace Corps' FOIA Officer, or designee, and in light of the considerations listed in paragraph (d) of this section, will determine whether the person on whom the demand was served should respond to the demand.

    (4) To the extent deemed necessary or appropriate, the General Counsel or designee may also require from the party causing such demand to be issued or served a plan of all reasonably foreseeable demands, including but not limited to names of all employees and former employees from whom discovery will be sought, areas of inquiry, length of time of proceedings requiring oral testimony and identification of documents to be used or whose production is sought.

    (c)  (1) In deciding whether to make disclosures pursuant to a demand, the General Counsel or designee, may consider, among things:

    (i) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose; and

    (ii) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege.

    (2) Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be made are those demands with respect to which any of the following factors exist:

    (i) Disclosure would violate a statute or a rule of procedure;

    (ii) Disclosure would violate the privacy rights of an individual;

    (iii) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation;

    (iv) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified by the originating agency;

    (v) Disclosure would reveal trade secrets or proprietary information without the owner's consent;

    (vi) Disclosure would otherwise adversely affect the interests of the United States or the Peace Corps; or

    (vii) Disclosure would impair an ongoing Inspector General or Department of Justice investigation.

  PART 305—ELIGIBILITY AND STANDARDS FOR PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER SERVICE

### Part 305

**Authority:** Authority: 22 U.S.C. 2503, 2504 2521; 29 U.S.C. 794; E.O. 12137, 44 FR 29023, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 389; E.O. 13160, 65 FR 39775, 3 CFR, 2000 Comp., p. 1461.

**Source:** Source: 82 FR 1188, Jan. 5, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

    § 305.1   Purpose and general guidelines.

#### § § 305.1

    This part states the requirements for eligibility for Peace Corps Volunteer service and the factors considered in the assessment and selection of eligible applicants for Peace Corps Volunteer service.

    (a)  For purposes of this part:

    (1)  means an individual for enrollment as a Volunteer, who has completed and submitted the Peace Corps Volunteer application form.

    (2)  means an individual for enrollment as a Volunteer during any period of training occurring prior to such enrollment.

    (3)  means an individual who has taken the prescribed oath and enrolled for service in the Peace Corps.

    (4)  means the act by which an individual becomes a Volunteer upon successful completion of training and taking the prescribed oath of office pursuant to Section 5 of the Peace Corps Act, 22 U.S.C. 2504.

    (5)  means an individual for whom an applicant or Volunteer has a legal or familial obligation to provide financial support.

    (6)  means any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the applicant or Volunteer is the equivalent of a family relationship.

    (b)  Invitations to serve in the Peace Corps are the result of a highly competitive application process. Many more individuals apply for Peace Corps Volunteer service than can be accepted. Because the Peace Corps cannot accept all eligible and qualified applicants who wish to serve, it evaluates applicants to select the best qualified among eligible applicants. The Peace Corps determines Applicants' eligibility, and assesses their relative skills, qualifications, and personal attributes, such as motivation, aptitude, fitness for service, emotional maturity, adaptability, productive competence, and ability to serve effectively as a Volunteer in a foreign country and culture.

    (c)  Under section 5(a) of the Peace Corps Act, 22 U.S.C. 2504(a), the President may enroll in the Peace Corps for service abroad qualified citizens and nationals of the United States. The terms and conditions of the enrollment of Volunteers are exclusively those set forth in the Peace Corps Act and those consistent therewith which the President may prescribe. The President has delegated his authority under section 5(a) of the Peace Corps Act to the Director of the Peace Corps pursuant to Executive Order 12137 (May 16, 1979), as amended.

    (d)  The Peace Corps does not discriminate against any person on account of race, color, religion, sex (including but not limited to gender identity and gender expression), national origin, age (40 and over), disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, parental status, political affiliation, union membership, genetic information, or history of participation in the EEO process, any grievance procedure or any authorized complaint procedure. Anyone who feels he or she has been discriminated against should contact the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, 202.692.2139,  Peace Corps, 1111 20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20526.

    (e)  In order for the Peace Corps to be able to make appropriate selection and placement decisions, it is critical that Applicants provide complete and accurate information throughout the application process, including information provided for a mandatory background investigation. The Peace Corps may disqualify an Applicant or separate a Volunteer or Trainee from Peace Corps service at any time if the Peace Corps determines that the Applicant, Volunteer, or Trainee provided materially false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information during the Peace Corps application process.

    § 305.2   Eligibility.

#### § § 305.2

    In order to be eligible for enrollment as a Volunteer, Applicants must meet mandatory citizenship and age requirements.

    (a)  The Applicant must be a citizen or national of the United States prior to entering on duty as a Trainee.

    (b)  The Applicant must be at least 18 years old at the time of entry on duty as a Trainee.

    § 305.3   Selection standards.

#### § § 305.3

    (a)  To qualify for selection for overseas service as a Volunteer, an Applicant must demonstrate that he or she is suitable, possessing the requisite personal and professional attributes required for Peace Corps service generally, and for the particular Volunteer assignment for which he or she is considered. The Peace Corps assesses each Applicant's personal, professional, educational, and legal qualifications in order to select those Applicants most likely to be successful in a Peace Corps assignment, serving under conditions of hardship if necessary to achieve the goals of the Peace Corps. Meeting these qualifications does not in and of itself entitle any individual to serve in the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps endeavors to select the best qualified individuals from among all eligible Applicants.

    (b)  Applicants must adequately demonstrate the following personal attributes to Peace Corps:

    (1)  A sincere desire to carry out the goals of Peace Corps service, and a commitment to serve a full term as a Volunteer.

    (2)  The intelligence and professional experience or educational background to meet the needs of the individual's assignment.

    (3)  The maturity, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, and self-sufficiency to adapt successfully to life in another culture, and to interact and communicate with other people regardless of cultural, social, and economic differences.

    (4)  In addition to any educational, professional or other qualifications and prerequisites that an individual must possess in order to be selected for a given assignment, a Trainee must demonstrate competence in the following areas by the end of pre-service training:

    (i)  The ability to communicate effectively in the appropriate language or languages of the country of service with the fluency required to meet the needs of the overseas assignment.

    (ii)  Proficiency in the technical skills needed to carry out the Trainee's assignment as a Volunteer.

    (iii)  Adequate knowledge of the culture and history of the country of assignment to ensure a successful adjustment to, and acceptance by, the host country society, as well as an appropriate understanding of the history and government of the United States which qualifies the individual to represent the United States abroad.

    (c)  Failure to meet initial selection standards, failure to attain any of the selection standards by the completion of training, or failure to maintain these standards during service, may be grounds for de-selection and disqualification from Peace Corps service.

    § 305.4   Medical status eligibility standard.

#### § § 305.4

    (a)  Under the Peace Corps Act (22 U.S.C. 2504(e)), the Peace Corps is responsible for ensuring that Peace Corps Volunteers receive all necessary or appropriate health care during their service. To ensure that the Peace Corps will be capable of doing so, Applicants must be medically qualified for Peace Corps Volunteer service. An Applicant who is otherwise qualified must meet the following requirements:

    (1) The Applicant, with or without reasonable accommodation, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services, must have the physical and mental capacity required to meet the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer. In this context, the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer include, without limitation, the capability to:

    (i) Live and work independently in an isolated location overseas at the same socio-economic level and in similar conditions as members of the community to which the Applicant is assigned;

    (ii) Perform the job to which the Applicant is assigned; and

    (iii) Complete a specified tour of service without undue disruption.

    (2) The Peace Corps must be capable of providing the Applicant with such health care as the Peace Corps deems to be necessary or appropriate.

    (3) The Applicant must not pose a direct threat (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).

    (b)  In determining whether an Applicant is medically qualified, an individualized assessment is required regarding each of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c)  (1) A “direct threat” is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation to policies, practices or procedures, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services.

    (2) In determining whether an applicant poses a direct threat, the Peace Corps will make an individualized assessment based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain:

    (i) The nature, duration and severity of the risk;

    (ii) The probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and

    (iii) Whether reasonable accommodations, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.

    (d)  (1) The term “accommodation” means modifications to the Peace Corps' policies, practices or procedures.

    (2) An accommodation is not reasonable if:

    (i) It would modify the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer;

    (ii) It would modify, among other things, the Applicant's Volunteer assignment or the Peace Corps' medical program in a way that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service, program, or activity; or

    (iii) It would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, including its medical program.

    (3) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, the Peace Corps may take into account, among other things:

    (i) The size and composition of the Peace Corps staff at the post of assignment;

    (ii) The adequacy of local medical facilities and the availability of other medical facilities;

    (iii) The nature and cost of the accommodation compared to the overall number of Volunteers and the overall size of the Peace Corps budget; and

    (iv) The capacities of the host country agency and of the host community to which the Applicant would be assigned.

    (e)  (1) An Applicant who is determined by medical screening staff not to be medically qualified for Peace Corps Volunteer service may request review of that decision by submitting any relevant information to the Office of Medical Services (OMS). The information submitted by the Applicant will be reviewed by a physician, and, unless the physician determines that the Applicant is medically qualified, by a Pre-Service Review Board (PSRB) composed of medical personnel in OMS and advised by the General Counsel. Procedures for such review are subject to approval by the General Counsel.

    (2) The PSRB will include as voting members at least one physician as well as other medical professionals in OMS. In any case involving review of issues involving mental health, at least one mental health professional from the Counseling and Outreach Unit will also participate as a voting member.

    (3) The decision of the PSRB will be reviewed by the General Counsel for legal sufficiency. Subject to that review, it will constitute the final agency action.

    § 305.5   Legal status eligibility standard.

#### § § 305.5

    (a)  The existence of an arrest or conviction record may, but will not automatically, exclude an Applicant from consideration for Peace Corps service. The Peace Corps will consider the nature of the offense, how long ago the offense occurred, whether the Applicant was acquitted of the offense, the terms of any applicable parole or probation, and other relevant facts or indications of rehabilitation.

    (b)  (1) An Applicant with any drug-related conviction, with a conviction for public intoxication, driving under the influence (DUI), or driving while intoxicated (DWI), with a conviction for reckless driving after having been initially charged with DUI or DWI, or with a similar alcohol-related conviction, is not eligible to have his or her application for Peace Corps service considered until 12 months has passed from the date of the incident.

    (2) An Applicant who, at any time on or prior to the day of departure for Peace Corps service, is arrested for any drug offense or for public intoxication, DUI, DWI or any similar alcohol-related offense will have any pending application or invitation for Peace Corps service withdrawn. If the charges are dismissed, an Applicant whose application or invitation for Peace Corps service was terminated may immediately reapply. If the applicant is convicted of the offense, he or she may reapply after 12 months from the date of the incident.

    (c)  An Applicant who is rejected for a Volunteer position because of an arrest or conviction may request a review of that decision by submitting any relevant information to the Associate Director of the Office of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection (VRS). The Associate Director will review the information submitted and consult with the General Counsel. The decision of the Associate Director will be the final agency decision. The Associate Director may delegate authority to conduct such a review to another senior member of VRS, but not to the supervisor of the office making the original eligibility determination.

    (d)  An Applicant rejected for service due to failure to meet the legal status eligibility standard may reapply at a later date, but not sooner than 12 months after the final agency decision.

    § 305.6   Applicants with an intelligence background.

#### § § 305.6

    (a)  It has been the longstanding policy of the Peace Corps to exclude from Volunteer service any individuals who have engaged in intelligence activity or related work or who have been employed by or connected with an intelligence agency, either for a specific period of time or permanently (depending on the agency). This policy is founded on the premise that it is crucial to the Peace Corps in carrying out its mission that there be a complete and total separation of Peace Corps from the intelligence activities of the United States Government or any foreign government, both in reality and appearance. Any semblance of a connection between the Peace Corps and the intelligence community would seriously compromise the ability of the Peace Corps to develop and maintain the trust and confidence of the people of the host countries. To ensure that there is not the slightest basis for the appearance of any connection between the Peace Corps and the intelligence community, this policy contains certain temporary and permanent bars to Peace Corps service. Serious doubts about an Applicant's connection with intelligence activities are to be resolved in favor of exclusion.

    (b)  For purposes of this section:

    (1)  includes any activities or specialized training involving or related to the clandestine collection of information, or the analysis or dissemination of such information, intended for use by the United States Government or any foreign government in formulating or implementing political or military policy in regard to other countries. The term “intelligence activity” includes any involvement in covert actions designed to influence events in foreign countries. The fact that the name of an employer or the description of a person's work uses or does not use the term “intelligence” does not, in and of itself, mean that the person has or has not engaged in intelligence activity or related work.

    (2)  includes:

    (i) Any agency, division of an agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government that is a member of the United States Intelligence Community; and

    (ii) Any other agency, division of an agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government or any foreign government, a substantial part of whose mission has been determined by the General Counsel to include intelligence activities.

    (3)  refer to the existence of a relationship of employer and employee, whether full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, whether or not the individual is engaged in intelligence activity for an employer, without regard to the length of time the relationship existed or is proposed to exist, and includes individuals performing duties as volunteers, fellows, interns, consultants, personal services contractors, contractors (non-personal services contractors), and employees of contractors who were assigned to work for an intelligence agency or to engage in intelligence activities. Employees of contractors who were or are not themselves assigned to work for an Intelligence Agency or to engage in intelligence activities are not considered to have been or to be employed by an intelligence agency.

    (c)  (1) An Applicant currently or formerly employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is permanently ineligible for Peace Corps Volunteer service.

    (2) An Applicant who has been employed by an intelligence agency other than the CIA is ineligible for a minimum of 10 years from the last day of employment by such intelligence agency. This bar on an Applicant who is or was employed by an intelligence agency applies whether or not the Applicant was engaged in intelligence activity for the intelligence agency.

    (3) An Applicant who has been engaged in intelligence activities is ineligible for service as a Volunteer for a period of 10 years from the last date on which the Applicant engaged in intelligence activities.

    (4) An Applicant may be ineligible for service for a period in excess of 10 years if the General Counsel determines that the Applicant's background or work history with regard to intelligence activities warrants such action.

    (d)  (1) An Applicant whose background discloses a relationship to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity may be ineligible to serve as a Peace Corps Volunteer. The term “relationship” means any association with an intelligence agency or with an intelligence activity, if such association could be the basis for an inference or the appearance that an Applicant was engaged in an intelligence activity. The association could include, but not be limited to, one based upon a familial, personal or financial connection to an intelligence agency or with an intelligence activity.

    (2) Determinations of the eligibility or periods of ineligibility of such Applicants will be made by the General Counsel on a case by case basis using the criteria set forth below. Examples of the type of relationships among others that could lead to ineligibility are Applicants whose spouses, domestic partners, or parents are or were involved in actual intelligence activities, or members of the immediate family of prominent highly placed officials in an intelligence agency who might be the target of harassment or violence overseas as the result of family connections. Employment by an organization that has been funded by an intelligence agency may also lead to ineligibility.

    (3) In determining whether an Applicant's relationship to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity makes the Applicant ineligible for service, or in determining the duration of any ineligibility, the General Counsel will consider the following factors as appropriate:

    (i) Nature of the relationship.

    (ii) The intelligence agency with which the Applicant has the relationship.

    (iii) Duration of the relationship.

    (iv) Length of time that has elapsed since the last connection to the intelligence agency.

    (v) Where the intelligence activity or work was performed.

    (vi) Nature of the connection with intelligence activity or work.

    (vii) Whether or not the intelligence activity or work involved contact with foreign nationals.

    (viii) Whether the connection was known or unknown to the Applicant at the time it occurred.

    (ix) Training received, if any.

    (x) Regularity of the contact with foreign nationals, and nature of duties, if any.

    (xi) Public knowledge of the activity or connection.

    (xii) Any other information which bears on the relationship of the Applicant to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity.

    (e)  VRS is responsible for the initial screening of Peace Corps Volunteer applications for compliance with the provisions of this policy. In cases where that office is unable to make a decision regarding the eligibility of an Applicant under this policy, the individual's application will be referred to the General Counsel, who will make the determination on eligibility.

    (f)  VRS will inform all Applicants promptly and in writing of any decision to disqualify them based on an intelligence background and the reasons for that decision. Applicants have 15 days from the date of receipt of the letter from VRS to appeal the decision to the Director of the Peace Corps. The decision of the Director of the Peace Corps will be the final agency decision.

    (g)  Pursuant to agreements between the Peace Corps and certain intelligence agencies, those intelligence agencies will not employ former Volunteers for a specified period after the end of their Peace Corps service and will not use former Volunteers for certain purposes or in certain positions. Information regarding such agreements may be obtained from the Office of the General Counsel.

    § 305.7   Special circumstances.

#### § § 305.7

    (a)  Two Applicants who are married to one another or two unmarried Applicants who are in a same-sex or opposite-sex domestic partnership or other committed relationship are eligible to apply for service as a couple. In the case of an unmarried couple, each member of the couple must provide a sworn statement, in a form acceptable to the Peace Corps, attesting to their domestic partnership status or committed relationship (as the case may be) and their request to be considered for assignment as a couple. In all cases, both members of the couple must apply and qualify for assignment at the same location.

    (b)  In general, dependents and other family members may not accompany a Volunteer during service. However, the Peace Corps may from time to time make exceptions either on a case-by-case basis or for particular categories of Volunteers to the extent permitted by Federal law.

    (c)  The Peace Corps welcomes applications from veterans, reservists, and active duty military personnel who are interested in Peace Corps service after completion of their military service. After receiving an invitation for Peace Corps service, applicants with reserve obligations are reminded to comply with all requirements to notify their reserve component that they will be unavailable for drills and annual training because of their Peace Corps service. Such applicants are urged to obtain written confirmation from their reserve component that they have complied with these requirements.

    § 305.8   Background investigation.

#### § § 305.8

    Section 22 of the Peace Corps Act requires that each Applicant be investigated to ensure that enrollment of the Applicant as a Volunteer is consistent with the national interest. The Peace Corps therefore obtains an appropriate background investigation for all Applicants who are invited to serve in the Peace Corps. Information revealed by the background investigation may be grounds for disqualification from Peace Corps service. Under the Peace Corps Act, if a background investigation regarding an Applicant develops any data reflecting that the Applicant is of questionable loyalty or is a questionable security risk, the Peace Corps must refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full field investigation. The results of that full field investigation will be furnished to the Peace Corps for information and appropriate action.

      (2) When an applicant, trainee, or volunteer makes a complaint which contains an allegation of prohibited discrimination in connection with an early termination or other administrative procedure of the agency, only the allegation of prohibited discrimination will be processed under this part. At the discretion of the OCRD Director, additional allegations or claims material to the complaint may be consolidated with the discrimination complaint for processing under these regulations. Any issues which are not so consolidated will continue to be processed under those procedures pursuant to which they were originally raised.

      (3) Complaints of retaliation in connection with allegations made under the Peace Corps Volunteer Confidentiality Protection policy shall be handled in accordance with that policy.

      (b) The OCRD Director has the discretion to consolidate complaints from different applicants, Trainees, or Volunteers that allege common underlying facts and similar claims.

      § 306.5   Representation.

#### § § 306.5

The determination whether to consider the complaint in the same or a separate proceeding is within the discretion of the OCRD Director.

    Subpart B—Processing Individual Complaints of Discrimination

      § 306.8   Pre-complaint procedure.

#### § § 306.8

      (a) Any applicant, trainee or volunteer who believes that he or she has been subject to prohibited discrimination must bring such allegations to the attention of OCRD within 60 days of the alleged discrimination, at which point a Counselor will be assigned to attempt to resolve them.

      (b) The pre-complaint procedure is intended to determine whether the concerns of the aggrieved party can be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the aggrieved party and the agency without the filing of a formal complaint.

      (c) The counselor serves as a neutral party, to gather a limited amount of information from the aggrieved party about his or her allegations, explain to the aggrieved party his or her rights, obtain information to determine the applicability of this regulation, and where appropriate, attempt an informal resolution among relevant parties.

      (d) The amount of information that the counselor gathers from the agency is limited to information needed to reach an informal resolution to the mutual satisfaction of the aggrieved party and the agency.

      (e) The counselor will keep a written record of his or her activities, which will be submitted to the OCRD Director as a counselor's report.

      (f) To the extent necessary to reach an informal resolution, the counselor may reveal to relevant agency officials the identity of the aggrieved party. In the event that the aggrieved party requests that the Counselor not share his or her identity with agency officials, the Counselor will not reveal the identity of the aggrieved party (or information that could be used to easily identify the aggrieved party) outside of OCRD. If appropriate, the Counselor should explain to the aggrieved party that an informal resolution and/or the scope of relief available may be limited as a result of the request for anonymity.

      (g) The pre-complaint process should be completed within 30 days, but the OCRD Director may extend the period upon request of the aggrieved party or the agency for good cause shown.

      (h) If, after inquiry and counseling, an informal resolution to the allegation is not reached, the Counselor will notify the aggrieved party in writing of the right to file a formal complaint of discrimination with the OCRD Director within 30 calendar days of the aggrieved party's receipt of the notice.

      (i) As an alternative to assignment of a Counselor as described above, the aggrieved party may ask for Alternative Dispute Resolution as set out in the Peace Corps' policy. In such a case, the parties have 90 days to attempt in good faith to reach an informal resolution of the allegation. At any time during the course of Alternative Dispute Resolution, the aggrieved party or the Responsible Management Official (or their Supervisor), in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, may terminate those proceedings.

      § 306.9   Complaint procedure.

#### § § 306.9

      (a) An applicant, trainee or volunteer who wishes to file a formal complaint must do so within 30 days of receiving the notice set out in 306.8(g) above, by filing a signed complaint in writing with OCRD. A complaint must set forth specifically:

      (1) A detailed description, including names and dates, if possible, of the actions of the Peace Corps officials or other persons which resulted in the alleged prohibited discrimination;

      (2) The manner in which the Peace Corps' action directly affected the complainant; and

      (3) The relief sought.

      (b) A complaint that does not conform to the above requirements will nevertheless be deemed to have been received by the OCRD, and the complainant will be notified of the steps necessary to correct the deficiencies of the complaint. The complainant will have 30 days from receipt of notification that the complaint is defective to submit an amended complaint.

      (c) The OCRD Director must accept a complaint if the process set forth above has been followed, and the complaint states a covered claim of prohibited discrimination. The OCRD Director may extend the time limits set out above:

      (1) When the complainant shows that they were not notified of the time limits and were not otherwise aware of them;

      (2) The complainant shows that they were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from submitting the matter in a timely fashion; or

      (3) For other reasons considered sufficient by the OCRD Director.

      (d) At any time during the complaint procedure, the OCRD Director may dismiss a complaint based on the aggrieved party's failure to prosecute the complaint. However, this action may be taken only after:

      (1) The OCRD Director has made a written request, including notice of the proposed dismissal, that the Complainant provide certain information or otherwise proceed with the complaint; and

      (2) 30 days have elapsed since the sending of the request.

      If the complaint is rejected for failure to meet one or more of the requirements set out in the procedure outlined in 306.8 or is dismissed, the OCRD Director will inform the aggrieved party in writing of this FAD, advising that the Peace Corps will take no further action.

      (e) Upon acceptance of the complaint and receipt of the Counselor's report, the OCRD Director will provide for a prompt impartial investigation of the complaint. The OCRD may employ a Peace Corps employee or external party to conduct the investigation. If a Peace Corps employee is selected to investigate the complaint, the person assigned to investigate the complaint may not occupy a position in the agency which is, directly or indirectly, under the jurisdiction of the head of that part of the agency in which the complaint arose. The investigation will include a review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred, and any other circumstances which may constitute, or appear to constitute, discrimination against the complainant.

      (f) Agency officials responsible for providing information relating to the complaint to the investigator will be provided such information about the complaint as they may need in order to respond appropriately. For example, responding agency officials who have a need to know may be provided with information including the identity of the complainant and statements of the alleged discriminatory basis and adverse action.

      (g) In cases where sensitive and/or protected information about applicants, trainees, or volunteers (other than the complainant) is requested or involved, agency officials may only disclose such information that is directly relevant to claim(s) being investigated, and must ensure that such information is handled in such a manner that the privacy of the applicants, trainees, or volunteers in question is fully protected, in accordance with the Peace Corps' policy on confidentiality of volunteer information.

      (h) Every agency official responsible for providing information relating to the complaint to the investigator may at any point consult the Office of the General Counsel and/or his or her supervisor, unless the supervisor is alleged to have been involved in the conduct that is the subject of the complaint. Agency officials responsible for providing information to the investigator shall only provide information based on personal knowledge, and should not seek to align or conform his or her statement with that of another responding agency official.

      (i) The investigator will compile a report of investigation (ROI) and forward the ROI to the OCRD Director. The OCRD Director will arrange for preparation of a draft FAD, which will be in writing, state the reasons underlying the decision, recommend corrective action if and as appropriate, and advise the complainant of the right to appeal the recommended FAD to the Peace Corps Director, or designee. To the extent feasible, this will be completed within 120 days of the filing of the complaint. However, the OCRD Director has discretion to extend the period.

      (j) The OCRD Director will issue the proposed FAD to the complainant with a copy of the ROI.

      (k) Within ten calendar days of receipt of such proposed FAD, the complainant may submit his or her appeal of the proposed disposition to the Peace Corps Director, or designee.

      (l) The Peace Corps Director, or designee, will, to the extent feasible, decide the issue within 45 days of the date of receipt of the appeal. The claimant will be informed in writing of the decision and its basis and advised that it is the FAD regarding the complaint.

      (m) Where a complainant does not submit a timely appeal pursuant to (k) above, the OCRD Director will issue the proposed FAD as the FAD.

      (n) The OCRD Director will inform relevant management officials as to whether or not prohibited discrimination was found in the FAD.

      § 306.10   Corrective action.

#### § § 306.10

      When the agency's FAD states that the aggrieved party has been subjected to prohibited discrimination, the following corrective actions may be taken:

      (a) Selection as a trainee for an otherwise qualified complainant found to have been denied selection based on prohibited discrimination.

      (b) Reinstatement to volunteer service for a complainant found to have been early-terminated as a result of prohibited discrimination. To the extent possible, a terminated volunteer will be placed in the same position previously held. However, reinstatement to the specific country of prior service, or to the specific position previously held is contingent on programmatic considerations, including but not limited to the continued availability of the position or program in that country, and acceptance by the host country of such placement. If the same position is deemed to be no longer available, the aggrieved party will be offered reenrollment in a position in as similar as possible circumstances to the position previously held, or will be given interrupted service status. A reenrollment may require a medical clearance and/or other clearances, and both additional training and an additional two year commitment to Volunteer service.

      (c) Such other relief as may be deemed appropriate by the Peace Corps.

#### § § 309.4

      (b) Nothing in this regulation is intended to preclude utilization of informal administrative actions or remedies which may be available.

      (c) Nothing contained in this regulation is intended to deter Peace Corps from demanding the return of specific property or from demanding the return of the property or the payment of its value.

      (d) The failure of Peace Corps to comply with any provision in this regulation shall not serve as a defense to the debt.

      § 309.5   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

#### § § 309.5

      (a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, contract or excluded in accordance with FCCS, Peace Corps will assess:

      (1) Interest on unpaid debts in accordance with 31 CFR 901.9.

#### § § 309.6

      Whenever feasible, and except as required otherwise by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrative costs as required by this regulation, should be collected in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset, including salary offset, or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If Peace Corps agrees to accept payment in installments, it may require a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability of the debtor to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within three years.

      § 309.7   Designation.

#### § § 309.7

      The Chief Financial Officer is delegated authority and designated to perform all the duties for which the Director is responsible under the forgoing statutes and joint regulations.

      (b) Peace Corps will transfer to the Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service (FMS) any past due, legally enforceable non-tax debt that has been delinquent for 180 days or more so that FMS may take appropriate action to collect the debt or take other appropriate action in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

      (c) Peace Corps may transfer any past due, legally enforceable debt that has been delinquent for fewer than 180 days to FMS for collection in accordance with applicable law and regulation. (See 31 CFR part 285.)

      § 309.9   Notice—written demand for payment.

#### § § 309.9

      (a) Upon determination that a debt is owed to Peace Corps or the United States, Peace Corps shall promptly hand deliver or send by first-class mail (to the debtor's most current address in the records of Peace Corps) at least one written notice (e.g. Bill of Collection or demand letter) informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a Peace Corps debt, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Written demand under this subpart may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this part and or the FCCS, including but not limited to actions taken under the procedures applicable to administrative offset, including salary offset.

      (b) The written notice shall inform the debtor of:

      (1) The nature and amount of the debt, and the facts giving rise to the debt;

      (2) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the imposition of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, and the enforced collection actions described in § 309.5 of this part;

      (3) The applicable standards for imposing interest, penalties and administrative costs to delinquent debts;

      (4) Peace Corps' willingness to discuss alternative payment arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt under terms acceptable to Peace Corps;

      (5) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or office within Peace Corps;

      (6) Peace Corps' intention to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:

      (iii) Report to credit bureaus;

      (iv) Administrative wage garnishment;

      (v) Referral to Department of Justice for litigation action;

      (vi) Referral to Financial Management Service of the Department of the Treasury for collection;

      (vii) Other actions as permitted by the FCCS and applicable law.

      (7) How the debtor may inspect and copy records related to the debt;

      (8) The debtor's opportunity for an internal review of Peace Corps' determination that the debtor owes a debt or the amount of the debt;

      (9) The debtor's right, if any, to request waiver of collection of certain debts, as applicable;

      (10) Requirement that the debtor advise Peace Corps of any bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor.

      (c) Peace Corps may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) (6) through (10) of this section if Peace Corps determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt, or which have already been provided by prior notice, applicable agreement, or contract.

      § 309.10   Review requirements.

#### § § 309.10

      (a) For purposes of this section, whenever Peace Corps is required to afford a debtor a review within the agency, Peace Corps shall provide the debtor with an opportunity for an internal review of the existence or the amount of the debt. For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain debts, debtors may also request an outside hearing. (See subpart C of this part)

      (b) Any request for a review must be in writing to the contact office by the payment due date stated in the initial notice sent under § 309.9(b) or other applicable provision. The debtor's request shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in support.

      (1) Peace Corps will provide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate agency official. The review may include examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials and discussion by letter or orally with the debtor, at Peace Corps' discretion.

      (2) An oral hearing is not required when, in Peace Corps' determination, the matter can be decided on the documentary record. Peace Corps will provide a “paper hearing”, that is, a determination based upon a review of the written record unless Peace Corps makes a determination that a debt involves issues of credibility or veracity, at which point an oral hearing may be required. Unless otherwise required by law, such oral hearing shall not be a formal evidentiary hearing.

      § 309.11   Collection.

#### § § 309.11

      Upon final determination of the existence and amount of a debt, unless other acceptable payment arrangement have been made or procedures under a specific statute apply, Peace Corps shall collect the debt by one or more of the methods described in § 309.9(b) (6) (i-vii) or as otherwise authorized by law and regulation.

      (a) —(1) Payments otherwise due the debtor from the United States shall be offset from the debt in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3. These may be funds under the control of Peace Corps or other Federal agencies. Collection may be through centralized offset by the Financial Management Service (FMS) of the Department of the Treasury.

      (2) Such payments include but are not limited to vendor payments, salary, retirement, lump sum payments due upon Federal employment separation, travel reimbursements, tax refunds, loans or other assistance. Offset of Federal salary payments will be in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514.

      (3) Before administrative offset is instituted by another Federal agency or the FMS, Peace Corps shall certify in writing to that entity that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that Peace Corps has complied with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal law and regulations.

      (b) Any other method authorized by law or regulation.

    Subpart C—Salary Offset

      § 309.12   Purpose.

#### § § 309.12

      This subpart provides Peace Corps' policies and procedures for the collection by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain past due debts owed the United States Government.

      § 309.13   Scope.

#### § § 309.13

      (a) The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed to Peace Corps and debts owed to other Federal agencies by Peace Corps' employees. Peace Corps will make reasonable and lawful efforts to administratively collect amounts owed by employees prior to initiating salary offset action. This section does not apply to debts where collection by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute ( travel advances).

      (b)  The following statutes and regulations apply to Peace Corps' recovery of debts due the United States by salary offset:

      (1) 5 U.S.C. 5514, as amended, governing the installment collection of debts;

      (2) 31 U.S.C. 3716, governing the liquidation of debts by administrative offset;

      (3) 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, setting forth the minimum requirements for executive agency regulations on salary offset; and

      (4) 31 CFR parts 900 through 904, the Federal Claims Collections Standards.

      (c) Nothing in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

      § 309.14   Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

#### § § 309.14

      (a) When Peace Corps is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until Peace Corps provides the agency with a written certification that the debtor owes Peace Corps a debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of payment) and that Peace Corps has complied with these regulations.

      (b) When another agency is owed the debt, Peace Corps may use salary offset against one of its employees who is indebted to another agency, if requested to do so by that agency. Such request must be accompanied by a certification that the person owes the debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of payment) and that the agency has complied with its regulations as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

      § 309.15   Notice requirements before offset.

#### § § 309.15

      (a) Deductions under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be made unless the creditor agency first provides the employee with written notice that he/she owes a debt to the Federal Government at least 30 calendar days before salary offset is to be initiated. When Peace Corps is the creditor agency this notice of intent to offset an employee's salary shall be hand-delivered or sent by certified mail to the most current address that is available. The written notice will state:

      (1) That Peace Corps has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, its origin and nature, and the amount of the debt;

      (2) The intention of Peace Corps to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full;

      (3) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;

      (4) An explanation of the Peace Corps' policy concerning interest, penalties and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS (See § 309.5);

      (5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records of the Peace Corps pertaining to the debt claimed or to receive copies of such records if personal inspection is impractical;

      (6) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, an individual not under the supervision or control of the Peace Corps) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed, or the repayment schedule, so long as a petition is filed by the employee as prescribed;

      (7) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Peace Corps) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency, and documented in the creditor agency's files;

      (8) The name, address and telephone number of an officer or employee of the Peace Corps who may be contacted concerning procedures for requesting a hearing;

      (9) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;

      (10) That the timely filing of a petition for a hearing as prescribed will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

      (11) The name and address of the office to which the petition should be sent;

      (12) That the Peace Corps will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset, as appropriate, (which may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay) not less than 30 calendar days from the date of delivery of the notice of debt, unless the employee files a timely petition for a hearing;

      (13) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 calendar days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

      (14) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the employee to:

      (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under the Peace Corps Act or the Foreign Service Act, Peace Corps regulations, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

      (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, §§ 3729-3731 of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; and

      (iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or any other applicable authority;

      (15) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made;

      (16) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and

      (17) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.

      (b) Peace Corps is not required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following adjustments are made by Peace Corps to a Peace Corps employee's pay:

      (1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;

      (2) A routine adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting the adjustment; or

      (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt of $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature of the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment.

      § 309.16   Review.

#### § § 309.16

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee who desires an outside hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed offset schedule must send a request to the office designated in the notice of intent. See § 309.15(a)(8). The request must be received by the designated office not later than 20 calendar days after the date of delivery of the notice as provided in § 309.15(a). The request must be signed by the employee and should identify and explain with reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evidence and witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted from each check, the request should state the objection and the reasons for it. The employee must also specify whether an oral hearing or a review of the documentary evidence is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.

      (b)  (1) If the employee files a petition for a review after the expiration of the 20 calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated office may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of a failure to receive the notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee has actual knowledge of the filing deadline).

      (2) An employee waives the right to a review, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with Peace Corps' offset schedule, if the employee fails to file a request for a hearing unless such failure is excused as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (3) If the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified, unless the hearing official determines failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control, his or her appeal will be decided on the basis of the documents then available to the hearing official.

      (c)  The creditor agency may be represented by a representative of its choice. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her expense.

      (d)  (1) An employee who intends to inspect or copy creditor agency records related to the debt in accordance with § 309.15(a)(5), must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be sent within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice.

      (2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.

      (3) If personal inspection is impractical, copies of such records shall be sent to the employee.

      (e)  (1) If an employee timely files a request for an oral hearing under § 309.16(a), the matter will be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of Peace Corps.

      (2)  (i) After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.

      (ii) An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone ( when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.

      (iii) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review of the available written record.

      (iv) The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses who provide testimony will do so under oath or affirmation.

      (3)  The written decision shall include:

      (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;

      (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and

      (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset will commence, if applicable.

      (4)  In the absence of good cause shown ( excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing upon the request of the creditor agency representative when good cause is shown.

      (5) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersede the finding by Peace Corps that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the debt through alternative collection methods under other appropriate methods.

      § 309.17   Procedures for salary offset.

#### § § 309.17

      Unless otherwise provided by statute or contract, the following procedures apply to salary offset:

      (a)  Salary offset will be made by deduction at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of the employee without his or her consent.

      (b)  The source of salary offset is current disposable pay.

      (c) —(1)  Ordinarily debts will be collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However, if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment deductions.

      (2)  (i) The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to greater amount.

      (ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

      (iii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of not greater than the anticipated period of employment.

      § 309.18   Voluntary repayment agreements as an alternative to salary offset.

#### § § 309.18

      (a) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt and set forth a proposed repayment schedule. Any proposal under this paragraph must be received by the official designated in that notice within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice of intent.

      (b) When the Peace Corps is the creditor agency, in response to a timely proposal by the debtor the agency will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset.

      (c) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision to file a petition for a review.

      (d) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and a designated agency official.

      § 309.19   Waiver.

#### § § 309.19

      (a) Under certain circumstances, employees may have a statutory right to request a waiver of indebtedness. When an employee makes a request under a statutory right, further collection will be stayed pending an administrative determination on the request.

      (b) Waiver of indebtedness is an equitable remedy and as such must be based on an assessment of the facts involved in the individual case under consideration. The burden is on the employee to demonstrate that the applicable waiver standard has been met.

      § 309.20   Compromise.

#### § § 309.20

      Peace Corps may attempt to effect compromise in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS (31 CFR part 902).

      § 309.21   Suspension of collection.

#### § § 309.21

      Suspension of collection action shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS (31 CFR 903.1-903.2).

      § 309.22   Termination of collection.

#### § § 309.22

      Termination of collection action shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS (31 CFR 903.1 and 903.3-903.4).

      § 309.23   Discharge.

#### § § 309.23

      Once a debt has been closed out for accounting purposes and collection has been terminated, the debt is discharged. Peace Corps will report discharged debt as income to the debtor to the Internal Revenue Service per 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1.

      § 309.24   Bankruptcy.

#### § § 309.24

      Peace Corps generally terminates collection activity on debts that have been discharged in bankruptcy unless otherwise provided for by bankruptcy law. The CFO will seek legal advice by the General Counsel's office if there is the belief that any claims or offset may have survived the discharge of a debtor.

    Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

      § 311.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 311.200

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

      (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

      (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 311.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 311.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 311.210   Reporting.

#### § § 311.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 311.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 311.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 311.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section,  shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 311.400   Penalties.

#### § § 311.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 311.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 311.405

      Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

      § 311.410   Enforcement.

#### § § 311.410

      The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.

    Subpart E—Exemptions

      § 311.500   Secretary of Defense.

#### § § 311.500

      (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart F—Agency Reports

      § 311.600   Semi-annual compilation.

#### § § 311.600

      (a) The head of each agency shall collect and compile the disclosure reports (see appendix B) and, on May 31 and November 30 of each year, submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a report containing a compilation of the information contained in the disclosure reports received during the six-month period ending on March 31 or September 30, respectively, of that year.

      (b) The report, including the compilation, shall be available for public inspection 30 days after receipt of the report by the Secretary and the Clerk.

      (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (e) The first semi-annual compilation shall be submitted on May 31, 1990, and shall contain a compilation of the disclosure reports received from December 23, 1989 to March 31, 1990.

      (c) The annual report shall be submitted at the same time the agency submits its annual budget justifications to Congress.

      (d) The annual report shall include the following: All alleged violations relating to the agency's covered Federal actions during the year covered by the report, the actions taken by the head of the agency in the year covered by the report with respect to those alleged violations and alleged violations in previous years, and the amounts of civil penalties imposed by the agency in the year covered by the report.

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66588, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 312.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 312.100

      This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

      § 312.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 312.105

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

      (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Peace Corps; or

      (2) A(n) Peace Corps awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 312.605 and 312.660, respectively.)

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 312.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 312.110

      This part does not apply to any award that the Peace Corps Director or designee determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

      § 312.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 312.115

      It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 312.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 312.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 312.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 312.205 through 312.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 312.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 312.230).

      § 312.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 312.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 312.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 312.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 312.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 312.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 312.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 312.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 312.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 312.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 312.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 312.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and
