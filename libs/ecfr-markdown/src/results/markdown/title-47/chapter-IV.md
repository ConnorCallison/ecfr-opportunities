    (c) —(1)  The applicant must submit the certification set forth in Appendix A of this part if a State, or Appendix B of this part if a Tribal Organization, no later than the initial application deadline published in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. Failure to meet this deadline will preclude the applicant from receiving consideration for a 911 grant award.

    (2)  After publication of the funding allocation for the 911 Grant Program in a revision to the Funding Opportunity, applicants that have complied with paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be given additional time in which to submit remaining application documents in compliance with this section, including a supplemental project budget. The revision to the Notice of Funding Opportunity will provide such deadline information.
