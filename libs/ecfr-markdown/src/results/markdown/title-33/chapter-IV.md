        (b) Every vessel shall be properly trimmed.

        (c) No vessel, other than under exceptional circumstances and with special permission, shall be accepted for transit whose trim by the stern exceeds 45.7 dm.

        (d) Any vessel that is not adequately ballasted or properly trimmed in the opinion of an officer, may be refused transit or may be delayed.

        (e) To obtain clearance to transit the Seaway:

        (1) Every vessel entering the Seaway after operating beyond the exclusive economic zone must agree to comply with the “Code of Best Practices for Ballast Water Management” of the Shipping Federation of Canada dated September 28, 2000, while operating anywhere within the Great Lakes and the Seaway; and

        (2) Every other vessel entering the Seaway that operates within the Great Lakes and the Seaway must agree to comply with the “Voluntary Management Practices to Reduce the Transfer of Aquatic Nuisance Species Within the Great Lakes by U.S. and Canadian Domestic Shipping” of the Lake Carriers Association and Canadian Shipowners Association dated January 26, 2001, while operating anywhere within the Great Lakes and the Seaway. For copies of the “Code of Best Practices for Ballast Water Management” and of the “Voluntary Management Practices to Reduce the Transfer of Aquatic Nuisance Species Within the Great Lakes by U.S. and Canadian Domestic Shipping” refer to the St. Lawrence Seaway Web site at

        (f) As a condition of transit of the Seaway after having operated outside the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) every vessel that carries only residual amounts of ballast water and/or sediment that were taken onboard the vessel outside the EEZ shall:

        (1) Conduct a saltwater flushing of their ballast water tanks that contain the residual amounts of ballast water and/or sediment in an area 200 nautical miles from any shore before entering waters of the Seaway. Saltwater flushing is defined as the addition of mid-ocean water to ballast water tanks: The mixing of the flushwater with residual water and sediment through the motion of the vessel; and the discharge of the mixed water, such that the resultant residual water remaining in the tank has as high salinity as possible, and is at least 30 parts per thousand (ppt). The vessel shall take on as much mid-ocean water into each tank as is safe (for the vessel and crew) in order to conduct saltwater flushing. And adequate flushing may require more than one fill-mix-empty sequence, particularly if only small amounts of water can be safely taken onboard at one time. The master of the vessel is responsible for ensuring the safety of the vessel, crew, and passengers. Vessels reporting only residual ballast water onboard shall take particular care to conduct saltwater flushing on the transit to the Great Lakes so as to eliminate fresh and or brackish water residuals in ballast tanks; and

        (2) Maintain the ability to measure salinity levels in each tank onboard the vessel so that final salinities of at least 30 ppt can be ensured.

        (g) Every tank that is found not in compliance with 401.30(f) shall retain any ballast water until it exits the Seaway.

        (h) These requirements do not apply to vessels of the armed forces, as defined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or that are owned or operated by a state and used in government noncommercial service.

      § 401.203   Reports of violations of Seaway regulations and instituting and conducting civil penalty proceedings.

#### § § 401.203

      (a) Violations of Seaway Regulations, Subpart A of this part, will be brought to the attention of the alleged violator at the time of detection whenever possible. When appropriate, there will be a written notification of the fact of the violation. This notification will set forth the time and nature of the violation and advise the alleged violator relative to the administrative procedure employed in processing civil penalty cases. The alleged violator will be advised that he or she has 15 days in which to appear before the Associate Administrator or submit a written statement for consideration. The Associate Administrator shall, upon expiration of the 15-day period, determine whether there has been a violation of the Seaway Regulations.

      (b) If the Associate Administrator decides that a violation of Seaway Regulations has occurred, a determination will be made as to whether to invoke no penalty at all and close the case or whether to invoke a part or full statutory penalty. In either event, a written notice of the decision shall be given to advise the violator. If a penalty is assessed, such notice will advise the violator of the right to petition for relief within 15 days or such longer period as the Associate Administrator, in his or her discretion, may allow. The Associate Administrator may mitigate the penalty or remit it in full, except as the latter action is limited to paragraph (f) of this section. The violator may appear in person before the Associate Administrator. If the violator does not apply for relief but instead maintains that he or she has not committed the violation(s) charged, and the Associate Administrator, upon review, concludes that invocation of the penalty was proper, no remission or mitigation action will be taken. On the other hand, should the violator petition the Associate Administrator for relief without contesting the determination that violation did, in fact, occur, relief may be granted as the circumstances may warrant.

      (c) When the penalty is mitigated, such mitigation will be made conditional upon payment of the balance within 15 days of notice or within such other longer period of time as the Associate Administrator, in his or her discretion, may allow.

      (d) The violator may appeal to the Administrator from the action of the Associate Administrator. Any such appeal shall be submitted to the Administrator through the Associate Administrator within 15 days of the date of notification by the Associate Administrator, or such longer period of time as the Associate Administrator, in his or her discretions, may allow.

      (e) Should the alleged violator require additional time to present matters favorable to the case at any stage of these penalty proceedings, a request for additional time shall be addressed to the Associate Administrator who will grant a reasonable extension of time where sufficient justification is shown.

      (f) Under the following circumstances, the Corporation's Chief Counsel shall forward cases involving violations of the Seaway Regulations to the United States Attorney with the recommendation that action be taken to collect the assessed statutory penalty:

      (1) When, within the prescribed time, the violator does not explain the violation, appeal for mitigation or remission, or otherwise respond to written notices from the Associate Administrator; or

      (2) When, having responded to such inquiries, the violator fails or refuses to pay the assessed or mitigated penalty, or to appeal to the Administrator, within the time prescribed; or

      (3) When the violator denies that the violation(s) was committed by him or her, the Associate Administrator, upon review, disagrees and the violator thereafter fails to appeal to the Administrator, or to remit payment of the assessed penalty within the time prescribed (see paragraph (b) of this section); or

      (4) When the violator fails to pay within the prescribed time the penalty as determined by the Administrator after consideration of the violator's appeal from the action of the Associate Administrator.

      (g) If a report of boarding or an investigation report submitted by a Corporation employee or investigative body discloses evidence of violation of a Federal criminal statute, the Corporation's Chief Counsel, in accordance with § 401.204, shall refer the findings to the United States Attorney for appropriate action.

This final determination consists of deciding whether and under what conditions to prosecute or to abandon prosecution.

      (b) The Corporation's Chief Counsel is hereby authorized to determine whether or not a violation of the Seaway Regulations carrying a criminal penalty is one that would justify referral of the case to the U.S. Attorney.

      (c) The Corporation's Chief Counsel will identify the regulations that were violated and make specific recommendations concerning the proceedings to be instituted by the U.S. Attorney in every case.

      (d) Referral of a case to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution terminates the Corporation's authority with respect to the criminal aspects of a violation.

      (b) The decision of the U.S. Attorney as to whether to institute criminal proceedings shall not bar the initiation of civil penalty proceedings by the Associate Administrator.

      (b) The payment of any penalty will be acknowledged by written receipt.

      (c) If the penalty paid is determined by the Associate Administrator to have been improperly or excessively imposed, the payor will be notified and requested to submit an application for a refund which should be mailed to the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, attention of the Chief Engineer. Such application must be made by the payor within one year of the date of notification provided for in this section.

      (d) In the event the alleged violator is about to leave the jurisdiction of the United States, he or she will be required, before being allowed to depart, to post a bond in the amount and manner suitable to the Associate Administrator, from which bond any subsequent assessed or mitigated penalty may be satisfied.
