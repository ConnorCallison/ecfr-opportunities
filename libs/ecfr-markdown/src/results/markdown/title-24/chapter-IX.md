    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 902.1   Purpose, scope, and general matters.

#### § § 902.1

      (a)  The purpose of the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) is to improve the delivery of services in public housing and enhance trust in the public housing system among public housing agencies (PHAs), public housing residents, and the general public, by providing a management tool for effectively and fairly measuring the performance of a PHA in essential housing operations of projects, on a program-wide basis and individual project basis, and providing rewards for high performers and remedial requirements for poor performers.

      (b)  PHAS is a strategic measure of the essential housing operations of projects and PHAs. PHAS does not evaluate the compliance of a project or PHA with every HUD-wide or program-specific requirement or objective. Although not specifically evaluated through PHAS, PHAs are responsible for complying with nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, including but not limited to those specified in 24 CFR 5.105, for affirmatively furthering fair housing, requirements under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and requirements of other federal programs under which the PHA is receiving assistance. A PHA's adherence to these requirements will be monitored in accordance with the applicable program regulations and the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).

      (c)  HUD will assess and score the performance of projects and PHAs based on the indicators, which are more fully addressed in § 902.9: Physical condition, financial condition, management operations, and the Capital Fund program.

      (d)  HUD will make use of uniform and objective criteria for the physical inspection of projects and PHAs and the financial assessment of projects and PHAs, and will use data from appropriate agency data systems to assess management operations. For the Capital Fund program indicator, HUD will use information provided in the electronic Line of Credit Control System (eLOCCS), the Public Housing Information Center (PIC), or their successor systems. On the basis of this data, HUD will assess and score the results, advise PHAs of their scores, and identify low-scoring and poor-performing projects and PHAs so that these projects and PHAs will receive the appropriate attention and assistance.

      (e)  A PHA with fewer than 250 units that does not convert to asset management will be considered as one project by HUD.

      (f) HUD's s will be published from time to time in the  for public comment.

      § 902.3   Definitions.

#### § § 902.3

      As used in this part:

      means the U.S. Housing _Act_ of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 )

      is a receiver, private contractor, private manager, or any other entity that is under contract with a PHA, under a management agreement with a PHA, or that is otherwise duly appointed or contracted (for example, by court order or agency action), to manage all or part of a PHA's operations.

      is the PHA fiscal year that has been/is being assessed under PHAS.

      means the _Assistant Secretary_ for Public and Indian Housing.

      refers to a PHA that does not meet the minimum passing score of 5 points or 50 percent under the Capital Fund indicator.

      means a plan, as provided in § 902.73(a), that is developed by a PHA that specifies the actions to be taken, including timetables, that shall be required to correct deficiencies identified under any of the PHAS indicators and subindicators, and identified as a result of a PHAS assessment, when a memorandum of agreement (MOA) is not required.

      mean calendar days, unless otherwise specified.

      is HUD's standard for acceptable basic housing conditions and the level to which a PHA is required to maintain its public housing.

      means any finding or determination that requires corrective action, or any score below 60 percent of the available points for the physical condition, financial condition, or management operations indicators, and any score below 50 percent for the Capital Fund indicator. In the context of physical condition and physical inspection in subpart B of this part, “deficiency” means a specific problem, as described in the Dictionary of _Deficiency_ Definitions, such as a hole in a wall or a damaged refrigerator in the kitchen that can be recorded for inspectable items.

      means the documents published in the  that contain the inspection standards and scoring values pursuant to 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.

      (DF-RMC) means a Resident Management Corporation to which HUD directly provides operating and capital assistance under the provisions of 24 CFR 964.225(h).

      or  mean any of the three major components of public housing that are inspected, which are: inside, outside, and unit.

      means the individual parts, such as walls, kitchens, bathrooms, and other things, to be inspected in an inspectable area.

      is defined in § 902.75(b).

      (RMC) is defined in 24 CFR 964.7.

      means the average of the PHA's individual indicator scores, weighted by the number of units in each project, divided by the total number of units in all of the projects of the PHA. In order to compute a unit-weighted average, an individual project score for a particular indicator is multiplied by the number of units in each project to determine a “weighted value.” For example, for a PHA with two projects, one with 200 units and a score of 90, and the other with 100 units and a score of 60, the unit-weighted average score for the indicator would be (200 × 90 + 100 × 60)/300 = 80.

      § 902.5   Applicability.

#### § § 902.5

      (a)  This part applies to PHAs, Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), and AMEs. This part is also applicable to RMCs that receive direct funding from HUD in accordance with section 20 of the 1937 Act (DF-RMCs).

      (1)  (i) RMCs and DF-RMCs will be assessed and issued their own numeric scores under PHAS based on the public housing or portions of public housing that they manage and the responsibilities they assume that can be scored under PHAS. References in this part to PHAs include RMCs, unless stated otherwise. References in this part to RMCs include DF-RMCs, unless stated otherwise.

      (ii) AMEs are not issued PHAS scores. The performance of the AME contributes to the PHAS score of the project(s)/PHA(s) for which they assumed management responsibilities.

      (2)  The ACC makes a PHA legally responsible for all public housing operations, except where DF-RMC assumes management operations.

      (i) Because the PHA and not the RMC or AME is ultimately responsible to HUD under the ACC, the PHAS score of a PHA will be based on all of the projects covered by the ACC, including those with management operations assumed by an RMC or AME (including a court-ordered or administrative receivership agreement, if applicable).

      (ii) A PHA's PHAS score will not be based on projects managed by a DF-RMC.

      (3) This part does not apply to Moving-to-Work (MTW) agencies that are specifically exempted in their grant agreement.

      (b)  The regulations in this part are applicable to PHAs beginning with the first fiscal year end date after the effective date of this rule, and thereafter.

      § 902.9   PHAS scoring.

#### § § 902.9

      (a)  Each PHA will receive an overall PHAS score, rounded to the nearest whole number, based on the four indicators: Physical condition, financial condition, management operations, and the Capital Fund program. Each of these indicators contains subindicators, and the scores for the subindicators are used to determine a single score for each of these PHAS indicators. Individual project scores are used to determine a single score for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators. The Capital Fund program indicator score is entity-wide.

      (b)  The overall PHAS score is derived from a weighted average of score values for the four indicators, as follows:

      (1) The physical condition indicator is weighted 40 percent (40 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart B of this part.

      (2) The financial condition indicator is weighted 25 percent (25 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart C of this part.

      (3) The management operations indicator is weighted 25 percent (25 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart D of this part.

      (4) The Capital Fund program indicator is weighted 10 percent (10 points) of the overall PHAS score for all Capital Fund program grants for which fund balances remain during the assessed fiscal year. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart E of this part.

      § 902.11   PHAS performance designation.

#### § § 902.11

      All PHAs that receive a PHAS assessment shall receive a performance designation. The performance designation is based on the overall PHAS score and the four indicator scores, as set forth below.

      (a)  (1) A PHA that achieves a score of at least 60 percent of the points available under the financial condition, physical condition, and management operations indicators and at least 50 percent of the points available under the Capital Fund indicator, and achieves an overall PHAS score of 90 percent or greater of the total available points under PHAS shall be designated a high performer. A PHA shall not be designated a high performer if it scores below the threshold established for any indicator.

      (2) High performers will be afforded incentives that include relief from reporting and other requirements, as described in § 902.71.

      (b)  (1) A PHA that is not a high performer shall be designated a standard performer if the PHA achieves an overall PHAS score of at least 60 percent, and at least 60 percent of the available points for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators, and at least 50 percent of the available points for the Capital Fund indicator.

      (2) At HUD's discretion, a standard performer may be required by the field office to submit and operate under a Corrective Action Plan.

      (c)  A PHA shall be designated a substandard performer if the PHA achieves a total PHAS score of at least 60 percent and achieves a score of less than 60 percent under one or more of the physical condition, financial condition, or management operations indicators. The PHA shall be designated as substandard physical, substandard financial, or substandard management, respectively. The HUD office with jurisdiction over the PHA shall require a Corrective Action Plan if the deficiencies have not already been addressed in a current Corrective Action Plan.

      (d)  (1) A PHA that achieves an overall PHAS score of less than 60 percent shall be designated as a troubled performer.

      (2) In accordance with section 6(j)(2)(A)(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(A)(i)), a PHA that receives less than 50 percent under the Capital Fund program indicator under subpart E of this part will be designated as a troubled performer and subject to the sanctions provided in section 6(j)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(j)(4)).

      § 902.13   Frequency of PHAS assessments.

#### § § 902.13

      The frequency of a PHA's PHAS assessments is determined by the size of the PHA's Low-Rent program and its PHAS designation. HUD may, due to unforeseen circumstances or other cause as determined by HUD, extend the time between assessments by direct notice to the PHA and relevant resident organization or resident management entity, and any other general notice that HUD deems appropriate.

      (a)  HUD will assess and score the performance of a PHA with fewer than 250 public housing units, as follows:

      (1) A small PHA that is a high performer may receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;

      (2) A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer may receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and

      (3) All other small PHAs may receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with § 902.75.

      (b)  (1) All PHAs, other than stated in paragraph (a) of this section, may be assessed on an annual basis.

      (2) The physical condition score for each project will determine the frequency of inspections of each project in accordance with the inspection cycle laid out in 24 CFR 5.705(c). The PHAS physical condition indicator score for an assessment period shall be calculated by taking the unit-weighted average of the most recent physical condition score for each project, except that, starting July 1, 2023, no new physical condition indicator will be issued for a PHA until every project under the PHA has been inspected on or after July 1, 2023.

      (3) If a PHA is designated as a troubled performer, all projects will receive a physical condition inspection regardless of the individual project physical condition score.

      (4) In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.

      (c)  HUD shall not issue a PHAS score for the unaudited and audited financial information in the years that a PHA is not being assessed under PHAS. Although HUD shall not issue a PHAS score under such circumstances, a PHA shall comply with the requirements for submission of annual unaudited and audited financial statements in accordance with subpart C of this part and 24 CFR 5.801.

      § 902.22   Inspection of PHA projects.

#### § § 902.22

      The PHA's score for the physical condition indicator is based on an independent inspection of a PHA's project(s) provided by HUD and using the requirements and timelines laid out in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, to ensure projects meet acceptable basic housing conditions. Mixed-finance projects will be subject to the physical condition inspections.

> [88 FR 30501, May 11, 2023]

      § 902.24   [Reserved]

#### § § 902.24

      § 902.25   Physical condition scoring and thresholds.

#### § § 902.25

      (a)  Under the physical condition indicator, a score will be calculated for individual projects, as well as for the overall condition of a PHA's public housing portfolio.

      (b)  The overall physical condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the unit-weighted values is divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall physical condition indicator score.

      (c)  (1) The project or projects' 100-point physical condition score is converted to a 40-point basis for the overall physical condition indicator score. The project scores on the 100-point basis are multiplied by .40 in order to derive a 40-point equivalent score to compute the overall physical condition score and overall PHAS score.

      (2) In order to receive a passing score under the physical condition indicator, the PHA must achieve a score of at least 24 points, or 60 percent.

      (3) A PHA that receives fewer than 24 points will be categorized as a substandard physical condition agency.

      § 902.26   [Reserved]

#### § § 902.26

    Subpart C—Financial Condition Indicator

      § 902.30   Financial condition assessment.

#### § § 902.30

      (a)  The objective of the financial condition indicator is to measure the financial condition of each public housing project within a PHA's public housing portfolio for the purpose of evaluating whether there are sufficient financial resources to support the provision of housing that is DSS/GR. Individual project scores for financial condition, as well as overall financial condition scores, will be issued.

      (b)  A PHA's financial condition will be assessed under this indicator by measuring the combined performance of all public housing projects in each of the subindicators listed in § 902.35, on the basis of the annual financial report provided in accordance with § 902.33.

      (c)  Mixed-finance projects are excluded from the financial condition indicator.

      § 902.33   Financial reporting requirements.

#### § § 902.33

      (a)  All PHAs must submit their unaudited and audited financial data to HUD on an annual basis. The financial information must be:

      (1) Prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as further defined by HUD in supplementary guidance; and

      (2) Submitted electronically in the format prescribed by HUD using the Financial Data Schedule (FDS).

      (b)  The unaudited financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 2 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, with no penalty applying until the 16th day of the 3rd month after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with § 902.62.

      (c)  Audited financial statements will be required no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      (d)  All PHAs that meet the federal assistance threshold stated in the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must also submit year-end audited financial information.

      (e)  In addition to the submission of information required by paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA shall provide one copy of the completed audit report package and the Management Letter issued by the Independent Auditor to the local HUD field office having jurisdiction over the PHA.

> [76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75941, Dec. 7, 2015]

      § 902.35   Financial condition scoring and thresholds.

#### § § 902.35

      (a)  (1) Under the financial condition indicator, a score will be calculated for each project based on the values of financial condition subindicators and an overall financial condition score, as well as audit and internal control flags. Each financial condition subindicator has several levels of performance, with different point values for each level.

      (2) The financial condition score for projects will be based on the annual financial condition information submitted to HUD for each project under 24 CFR 990.280 and 990.285. The financial condition score for PHAs will be based on a unit-weighted average of project scores.

      (b)  The subindicators of financial condition indicator are:

      (1)  The QR compares quick assets to current liabilities. Quick assets are cash and assets that are easily convertible to cash and do not include inventory. Current liabilities are those liabilities that are due within the next 12 months. A QR of less than one indicates that the project's ability to make payments on a timely basis may be at risk.

      (2)  The MENAR measures a project's ability to operate using its net available, unrestricted resources without relying on additional funding. This ratio compares the adjusted net available unrestricted resources to the average monthly operating expenses. The result of this calculation shows how many months of operating expenses can be covered with currently available, unrestricted resources.

      (3)  The DSCR is the ratio of net operating income available to make debt payments, to the amount of the debt payments. This subindicator is used if the PHA has taken on long-term obligations. A DSCR of less than one would indicate that the project would have difficulty generating sufficient cash flow to cover both its expenses and its debt obligations.

      (c)  The overall financial condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is then divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall financial condition indicator score.

      (d)  (1) The PHA's financial condition score is based on a maximum of 25 points.

      (2) In order for a PHA to receive a passing score under the financial condition indicator, the PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points, or 60 percent of the available points under this indicator.

      (3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points available under this indicator will be categorized as a substandard financial condition agency.

    Subpart D—Management Operations Indicator

      § 902.40   Management operations assessment.

#### § § 902.40

      (a)  The objective of the management operations indicator is to measure the PHA's performance of management operations through the management performance of each project.

      (b)  Mixed-finance projects are excluded from the management operations indicator.

      § 902.43   Management operations performance standards.

#### § § 902.43

      (a)  The following subindicators listed in this section will be used to assess the management operations of projects and PHAs, consistent with section 6(j)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(1)). Individual project scores for management operations, as well as overall PHA management operations scores, will be issued.

      (1)  This subindicator measures the occupancy for the project's fiscal year, adjusted for allowable vacancies.

      (2)  This subindicator measures the tenant accounts receivable of a project against the tenant charges for the project's fiscal year.

      (3)  This subindicator measures the money that a project owes to vendors at the end of the project's fiscal year for products and services purchased on credit against total operating expenses.

      (b)  Projects will be assessed under this indicator through information that is electronically submitted to HUD through the FDS.

      § 902.44   Adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment.

#### § § 902.44

      (a)  In accordance with section 6(j)(1)(I)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(1)(I)(2)), the overall management operations score for a project will be adjusted upward to the extent that negative conditions are caused by situations outside the control of the project. These situations are related to the poor physical condition of the project or the overall depressed condition of the major census tract in which a project is located. The intent of this adjustment is to avoid penalizing such projects, through appropriate application of the adjustment.

      (b)  Definitions and application of physical condition and neighborhood environment factors are:

      (1) Physical condition adjustment applies to projects at least 28 years old, based on the unit-weighted average Date of Full Availability (DOFA) date.

      (2) Neighborhood environment adjustment applies to projects located in census tracts where at least 40 percent of the families have an income below the poverty rate, as documented by the most recent census data. If a project is located in more than one census tract, the census data for the census tract where the majority of the project's units are located shall be used.

      (c)  HUD will adjust the management operations score of a project, subject to one or both of the physical condition and neighborhood environment conditions. The adjustments will be made to the overall management operations score for each project so as to reflect the difficulty in managing the projects. In each instance where the actual management operations score is rated below the maximum score of 25 points, one point each will be added for physical condition and neighborhood environment, but not to exceed the maximum number of 25 points available for the management operations indicator.

      (d)  The adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment will be calculated by HUD and applied to all eligible projects.

      § 902.45   Management operations scoring and thresholds.

#### § § 902.45

      (a)  Under the management operations indicator, HUD will calculate a score for each project, as well as for the overall management operations of a PHA, that reflects weights based on the relative importance of the individual management subindicators.

      (b)  The overall management operations indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall management operations indicator score.

      (c)  (1) The PHA's management operations score is based on a maximum of 25 points.

      (2) In order to receive a passing score under the management operations indicator, a PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points or 60 percent.

      (3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points will be categorized as a substandard management operations agency.

    Subpart E—Capital Fund Program Indicator

      § 902.50   Capital Fund program assessment.

#### § § 902.50

      (a)  The Capital Fund program indicator examines the period of time taken by a PHA to obligate funds and occupy units in relation to statutory deadlines for obligation for all Capital Fund program grants for which fund balances remain during the assessed fiscal year. Funds from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) do not include HOPE VI program funds.

      (b)  This indicator is applicable on a PHA-wide basis, and not to individual projects. This indicator is not applicable to PHAs that choose not to participate in the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act.

      (c)  The subindicators pursuant to section 9(d) of the Act are:

      (1) Timeliness of fund obligation. This subindicator examines the period of time it takes for a PHA to obligate funds from the Capital Fund program under section 9(j)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(9)(j)).

      (2) Occupancy rate. This subindicator measures the PHA's occupancy rate as of the end of the PHA's fiscal year.

      (d)  The assessment required under the Capital Fund program indicator will be performed through analysis of obligated amounts in HUD's eLOCCS (or its successor) for all Capital Fund program grants that were open during the assessed fiscal year. This subindicator measures a statutory requirement for the Capital Fund program. Other aspects of the Capital Fund program will be monitored by HUD through other types of reviews, and in this indicator through considering occupancy rates.

      (1) PHAs are responsible to ensure that their Capital Fund program information is submitted to eLOCCS by the submission due date.

      (2) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS and/or the PIC systems by the submission due date.

      § 902.53   Capital Fund program scoring and thresholds.

#### § § 902.53

      (a)  The Capital Fund program indicator score provides an assessment of a PHA's ability to obligate Capital Fund program grants in a timely manner on capital and modernization needs.

      (b)  (1) The PHA's Capital Fund program score is based on a maximum of 10 points.

      (2) In order to receive a passing score under the Capital Fund program indicator, a PHA must achieve a score of at least 5 points, or 50 percent.

    Subpart F—PHAS Scoring

      § 902.60   Data collection.

#### § § 902.60

      (a)  To allow for a period of consistent assessments to refine and make necessary adjustments to PHAS, a PHA is not permitted to change its fiscal year for the first 3 full fiscal years following the effective date of this regulation, unless such change is approved by HUD for good cause.

      (b)  In the event of extenuating circumstances, a PHA may request extensions of time to submit its unaudited financial information. To receive an extension, a PHA must ensure that HUD receives the extension request electronically 15 days before the submission due date. The PHA's electronic extension request must include an objectively verifiable justification as to why the PHA cannot submit the information by the submission due date. PHAs shall submit their requests for extensions of time for the submission of unaudited financial information through the FASS-PH Secure Systems Web site. HUD shall forward its determination electronically to the requesting PHA.

      (c)  (1) HUD, for good cause, may grant PHAs a waiver of the due date of the submission of audited financial information to HUD. HUD shall consider written requests from PHAs for a waiver of the report submission due date (established by the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, as no later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year). The PHA's written request for a waiver of the due date of the submission of audited financial information must include an objectively verifiable justification as to why the PHA cannot submit the information by the submission due date. A PHA shall submit its written request for such a waiver, 30 days prior to the submission due date, to its local field office. HUD shall forward its written determination of the waiver request to the PHA and, if appropriate, establish a new submission due date for the audited financial information.

      (2) A waiver of the due date for the submission of audited financial information to HUD does not relieve a PHA of its responsibility to submit its audited information to OMB's Federal Audit Clearinghouse no later than 9 months after the end of its fiscal year.

      (d)  When HUD rejects a PHA's year-end unaudited financial information after the due date, a PHA shall have 15 days from the date of the rejection to resubmit the information without a penalty being applied, in accordance with § 902.62.

      (e)  Late points and late presumptive failure will only be applied to the financial condition indicator since the management operations information is derived from the financial condition submission.

      (f)  A management operations score can change as a result of the audited submission since the management operations information is derived from the financial condition submission.

      § 902.62   Failure to submit data.

#### § § 902.62

      (a)  (1) If a PHA without a finding of good cause by HUD does not submit its year-end financial information, required by this part, or submits its unaudited year-end financial information more than 15 days past the due date, appropriate sanctions may be imposed, including a reduction of one point in the total PHAS score for each 15-day period past the due date.

      (2) If the unaudited year-end financial information is not received within 3 months past the due date, or extended due date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for its unaudited information and shall receive zero points for its unaudited financial information and the final financial condition indicator score. The subsequent timely submission of audited information does not negate the score of zero received for the unaudited year-end financial information submission.

      (3) The PHA's audited financial statement must be received no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year-end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. If the audited financial statement is not received by that date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for the financial condition indicator.

      (b)  (1) A PHA's year-end financial information and any supporting documentation are subject to review by an independent auditor, as authorized by section 6(j)(6) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(j)(6)). Appropriate sanctions for intentional false certification will be imposed, including civil penalties, suspension or debarment of the signatories, the loss of high performer designation, a lower score under the financial condition indicator, and a lower overall PHAS score.

      (2) A PHA that cannot provide justifying documentation to HUD for the assessment under any indicator(s) or subindicator(s) shall receive a score of zero for the relevant indicator(s) or subindicator(s) and its overall PHAS score shall be lowered accordingly.

      (c)  If a PHA does not submit its unaudited or audited information, it will receive a zero for management operations.

      § 902.64   PHAS scoring and audit reviews.

#### § § 902.64

      (a)  (1) Adjustments to the score may be made after a PHA's audit report for the fiscal year being assessed is transmitted to HUD. If significant differences are noted between unaudited and audited results, a PHA's PHAS score will be adjusted in accordance with the audited results.

      (2) A PHA's PHAS score under individual indicators or subindicators, or its overall PHAS score, may be changed by HUD in accordance with data included in the audit report or obtained through such sources as HUD project management and other reviews, investigations by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, investigations or audits by HUD's Office of Inspector General, or reinspection by HUD, as applicable.

      (b)  (1) An overall PHAS score will be issued for each PHA after the later of one month after the submission due date for financial data or one month after submission by the PHA of its financial data. The overall PHAS score becomes the PHA's final PHAS score after any adjustments requested by the PHA and determined necessary under the processes provided in §§ 902.25(d), 902.35(a), and 902.68; any adjustments resulting from the appeal process provided in § 902.69; and any adjustments determined necessary as a result of the independent public accountant (IPA) audit.

      (2) Each PHA (or RMC) shall post a notice of its final PHAS score and designation in appropriate conspicuous and accessible locations in its offices within 2 weeks of receipt of its final PHAS score and designation. In addition, HUD will post every PHA's PHAS score and designation on HUD's Internet site.

      (c)  (1)  HUD may undertake a quality control review of the audit work papers or as part of the Department's ongoing quality assurance process.

      (2)  If HUD determines that the PHA's financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, it shall notify the PHA of such determination in writing. The PHA will have 30 days in which to respond to the notice of deficiency and to establish that the determination is erroneous. Following consideration of any PHA response, HUD will issue a final determination in writing to the PHA.

      (i)  Deficient financial statements are statements that are not presented, in some material respect, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board, or if applicable, the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

      (ii)  A deficient electronic financial submission is a filing that was not made, in some material respect, in accordance with HUD requirements or attested to in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards.

      (iii)  A deficient audit is one that was not performed, in some material respect, in compliance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards; Generally Accepted Auditing Standards; the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, when applicable; or HUD requirements.

      (3)  If HUD determines that the financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, HUD may adjust the financial indicator score to zero and/or reduce the overall PHAS score in accordance with the provisions of this section. Additionally, if HUD determines that the audit is deficient, HUD may, at its discretion, elect to serve as the audit committee for the PHA for the next fiscal year and select the audit firm that will perform the audit in question.

      § 902.66   Withholding, denying, and rescinding designation.

#### § § 902.66

      (a)  In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied all of the PHAS indicators for high performer or standard performer designation, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or standard performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:

      (1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD ( a civil rights compliance agreement);

      (2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical, financial, or management performance of a PHA;

      (3) Is operating under a court order;

      (4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or

      (5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under PHAS. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with federal laws and regulations.

      (b)  If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a standard performer, substandard performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a standard performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a substandard performer or troubled performer.

      (c)  The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or standard performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical PHAS score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      § 902.68   [Reserved]

#### § § 902.68

      § 902.69   PHA right of petition and appeal.

#### § § 902.69

      (a)  A PHA may take any of the following actions:

      (1) Appeal its troubled performer designation (including Capital Fund program troubled performer designation);

      (2) Appeal its final overall PHAS score;

      (3) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation;

      (4) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation; and

      (5) Appeal actions under § 902.66.

      (b)  (1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in any of the scores for its PHAS indicators, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's PHAS score and its designation (i.e., as troubled performer, substandard performer, standard performer, or high performer), the PHA may appeal its PHAS score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. A significant change in a PHAS score is a change that would cause the PHA's PHAS score to increase, resulting in a higher PHAS designation for the PHA (i.e., from troubled performer to substandard performer or standard performer, or from standard performer to high performer).

      (2) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, physical condition score, or both, based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection or the denial of a technical review request.

      (3) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS by the submission due date.

      (c)  (1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or a final overall PHAS score, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the overall PHAS score to the PHA. To petition the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.

      (2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.

      (3) To appeal the petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, or appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA shall submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.

      (4) An appeal of a troubled performer designation, the petition for removal of a troubled performer designation, or the appeal of a refusal of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of a PHAS score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.

      (d)  A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under § 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.

      (e)  (1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall PHAS score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.

      (2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.

      (f)  (1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, arrange for audit services, adjust the PHA's score, or perform other reexamination of the financial, management, or Capital Fund program information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's decision on appeal of a PHAS score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.

      (2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.

    Subpart G—PHAS Incentives and Remedies

      § 902.71   Incentives for high performers.

#### § § 902.71

      (a)  A PHA that is designated a high performer will be eligible for the following incentives, and such other incentives that HUD may determine appropriate and permissible under program statutes or regulations.

      (1)  A PHA that is designated a high performer will be relieved of specific HUD requirements ( will receive fewer reviews and less monitoring), effective upon notification of a high performer designation.

      (2)  High performer PHAs and RMCs that receive a score of at least 60 percent of the points available for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators, and at least 50 percent of the points available for the Capital Fund indicator, and achieve an overall PHAS score of 90 percent or greater of the total available points under PHAS shall be designated a high performer and will receive a Certificate of Commendation from HUD, as well as special public recognition, as provided by the field office.

      (3)  A high performer PHA may be eligible for bonus points in HUD's funding competitions, where such bonus points are not restricted by statute or regulation governing the funding program and are provided in the relevant notice of funding availability.

      (b)  Relief from any standard procedural requirement that may be provided under this section does not mean that a PHA is relieved from compliance with the provisions of federal law and regulations or other handbook requirements. For example, although a high performer or standard performer may be relieved of requirements for prior HUD approval for certain types of contracts for services, the PHA must still comply with all other federal and state requirements that remain in effect, such as those for competitive bidding or competitive negotiation (see 2 CFR 200.319, as applicable).

      (c)  A PHA designated as a high performer or standard performer remains subject to:

      (1) Regular independent auditor audits;

      (2) Office of Inspector General audits or investigations as circumstances may warrant; and

      (3) Reviews identified by the regional or field office in its current Risk Assessment of PHAs and projects.

      § 902.73   PHAs with deficiencies.

#### § § 902.73

      (a)  Standard and substandard performers will be referred to the field office for appropriate oversight and action.

      (1) A standard performer that receives a total score of at least 60 percent shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction, as stated in § 902.73(c). If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies, HUD may either require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or HUD may take other action, as appropriate.

      (2) A substandard performer,  a PHA that achieves a PHAS score of at least 60 percent and achieves a score of less than 60 percent of the total points available under one or more of the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators, shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction. If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies, HUD may require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or take other action, as appropriate.

      (3) A PHA with a project(s) that receives less than 60 percent of the points available for the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators, or less than 50 percent of the points available for the capital fund indicator, shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction, as stated in § 902.73(b). If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies within the time period allowed, HUD may either require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or take other action, as appropriate.

      (b)  (1)  After a PHA's (or DF-RMC's) receipt of its final overall PHAS score and designation as: A standard performer, within the range described in § 902.73(a)(1); or substandard performer, within the range described in § 902.73(a)(2), or, in the case of an RMC, after notification of its score from a PHA, a PHA or RMC shall correct any deficiency indicated in its assessment within 90 days, or within such period as provided in the HUD-executed Corrective Action Plan, if required.

      (2)  A PHA shall notify the regional or field office of its action to correct a deficiency. A PHA shall also forward to the regional or field office an RMC's report of its action to correct a deficiency. A DF-RMC shall forward directly to the regional or field office its report of its action to correct a deficiency.

      (c)  (1) If a PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) fails to correct deficiencies within the time period noted in paragraph (b) of this section, or to correct deficiencies within the time specified in a Corrective Action Plan, or within such extensions as may be granted by HUD, the field office will notify the PHA of its noncompliance.

      (2) The PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) will provide the field office with its reasons for lack of progress in negotiating, executing, or carrying out the Corrective Action Plan, within 30 days of the PHA's receipt of the noncompliance notification. HUD will advise the PHA as to the acceptability of its reasons for lack of progress.

      (3) If HUD finds the PHA's (or DF-RMC or RMC's) reasons for lack of progress unacceptable, HUD will notify the PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) that it will take such actions as it may determine appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the 1937 Act and other statutes, the ACC, this part, and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, the remedies available for substantial default.

      § 902.75   Troubled performers.

#### § § 902.75

      (a)  Upon a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, in accordance with the requirements of section 6(j)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(B)) and in accordance with this part, HUD must notify the PHA and shall refer each troubled performer PHA to the PHA's field office, or other designated office(s) at HUD, for remedial action, oversight, and monitoring. The actions to be taken by HUD and the PHA will include statutorily required actions, and such other actions as may be determined appropriate by HUD.

      (b)  Within 30 days of notification of a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, HUD will initiate activities to negotiate and develop an MOA. An MOA is required for a troubled performer. The final MOA is a binding contractual agreement between HUD and a PHA. The scope of the MOA may vary depending upon the extent of the problems present in the PHA. It shall include, but not be limited to:

      (1) Baseline data, which should be data without adjustments or weighting but may be the PHA's score in each of the PHAS indicators or subindicators identified as a deficiency;

      (2) Performance targets for such periods specified by HUD ( annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly), which may be the attainment of a higher score within an indicator or subindicator that is a problem, or the description of a goal to be achieved;

      (3) Strategies to be used by the PHA in achieving the performance targets within the time period of the MOA, including the identification of the party responsible for the completion of each task and for reporting progress;

      (4) Technical assistance to the PHA provided or facilitated by HUD; for example, the training of PHA employees in specific management areas or assistance in the resolution of outstanding HUD monitoring findings;

      (5) The PHA's commitment to take all actions within its control to achieve the targets;

      (6) Incentives for meeting such targets, such as the removal of a troubled performer designation or troubled with respect to the program for assistance from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) and HUD recognition for the most-improved PHAs;

      (7) The consequences of failing to meet the targets, which include, but are not limited to, the interventions stated in 24 CFR part 907 and in section 6(j)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)); and

      (8) A description of the involvement of local public and private entities, including PHA resident leaders, in carrying out the agreement and rectifying the PHA's problems. A PHA shall have primary responsibility for obtaining active local public and private entity participation, including the involvement of public housing resident leaders, in assisting PHA improvement efforts. Local public and private entity participation should be premised upon the participant's knowledge of the PHA, ability to contribute technical expertise with regard to the PHA's specific problem areas, and authority to make preliminary commitments of support, financial or otherwise.

      (c)  The PHA will have 10 days to review the MOA. During this 10-day period, the PHA shall resolve any claimed discrepancies in the MOA with HUD, and discuss any recommended changes and target dates for improvement to be incorporated in the final MOA. Unless the time period is extended by HUD, the MOA is to be executed 15 days following issuance of the draft MOA.

      (d)  (1)  Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA receives initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 12 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance by at least 50 percent of the difference between the initial PHAS assessment score that led to the troubled performer status and the score necessary to remove the PHA's designation as a troubled performer.

      (2)  Upon the expiration of the 2-year period that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 24 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance and achieve an overall PHAS score of at least 60 percent of the total points available.

      (e)  An MOA shall be executed by:

      (1) The PHA Board Chairperson (supported by a Board resolution), or a receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable) or other AME acting in lieu of the PHA Board;

      (2) The PHA Executive Director, or a designated receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable), or other AME-designated Chief Executive Officer; and

      (3) The field office

      (f)  HUD encourages the inclusion of the resident leadership in the execution of the MOA.

      (g)  (1) If a troubled performer PHA fails or refuses to execute an MOA within the period provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or a troubled performer PHA operating under an executed MOA does not show a substantial improvement, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, toward a passing PHAS score following the issuance of the failing PHAS score by HUD, the field office shall refer the PHA to the Assistant Secretary to determine such remedial actions, consistent with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, remedies available for substantial default.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, substantial improvement is defined as the improvement required by paragraph (d) of this section. The maximum period of time for remaining in troubled performer status before being referred to the Assistant Secretary is 2 years after the initial notification of the troubled performer designation. Therefore, the PHA must make substantial improvement in each year of this 2-year period.

      (3) The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section:

      (h)  For a PHA designated as a troubled performer, HUD may perform an audit review and may, at its discretion, select the audit firm that will perform the audit of the PHA; and HUD may, at its discretion, serve as the audit committee for the audit in question.

      (i)  To the extent feasible, while a PHA is in a troubled performer status, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.

      § 902.79   Verification and records.

#### § § 902.79

      All project and PHA certifications, year-end financial information, and supporting documentation are subject to HUD verification at any time, including review by an independent auditor. All PHAs must retain supporting documents for any certifications and for asset management reviews for at least 3 years. Failure to maintain and provide supporting documentation for a period of 3 years for any indicator(s), subindicator(s), or other methods used to assess performance shall result in a score of zero for the indicator(s) or subindicator(s), and a lower overall PHAS score for the applicable assessment period.

      § 902.81   Resident petitions for remedial action.

#### § § 902.81

      Residents of a PHA designated as troubled pursuant to section 6(j)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(A)) may petition HUD in writing to take one or more of the actions referred to in section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)). HUD will consider any petition from a group of residents totaling at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents, or from an organization or organizations of residents whose membership equals at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents. HUD shall respond to such petitions in a timely manner with a written description of the actions, if any, HUD plans to take and, where applicable, the reasons why such actions differ from the course proposed by the residents. Nothing in this section shall limit HUD's discretion to determine whether a substantial default has occurred or to select the appropriate intervention upon such determination.

      § 902.83   Sanctions for troubled performer PHAs.

#### § § 902.83

      (a) If a troubled performer PHA fails to make substantial improvement, as set forth in § 902.75(d), HUD shall:

      (1) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with 1,250 or more units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)); or

      (2) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with fewer than 1,250 units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and either petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)), or take possession of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA) pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(iv)), and appoint, on a competitive or noncompetitive basis, an individual or entity as an administrative receiver to assume the responsibilities of HUD for the administration of all or part of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA).

      (3) In the case of substantial default by a troubled performer PHA, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the courses of action available to HUD under this part, 24 CFR part 907, or section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)) for any other substantial default by a PHA.

      (b) If a troubled performer PHA fails to execute or meet the requirements of an MOA in accordance with § 902.75, other than as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may be deemed to be in substantial default by HUD and any remedy available therefore may be invoked in the discretion of HUD.

    Subpart H—Assessment of Small Rural Public Housing Agencies

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 30501, May 11, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

      § 902.101   Definition of small rural PHAs.

#### § § 902.101

      (a)  A PHA is a small rural PHA if it administers 550 or fewer combined public housing units and vouchers under section 8(o), and either:

      (1) Has a primary administrative building as determined with a physical address in a rural area as described in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A); or

      (2) More than 50 percent of its combined public housing units and voucher units under section 8(o) are in rural areas as described in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).

      (b)  (1) HUD will make the initial determination of PHAs that qualify as small rural as defined in this section no later than October 30, 2023.

      (2) HUD will determine if a PHA qualifies as a small rural PHA under paragraph (a) of this section every 3 years.

      (c)  A PHA may challenge HUD's determination concerning whether the PHA qualifies as small rural PHA by presenting an objectively verifiable material error which resulted in the incorrect determination, or by presenting information showing that the status of the PHA has changed to justify a redetermination.

      § 902.103   Public housing assessment of small rural PHAs.

#### § § 902.103

      (a)  The public housing program of small rural PHAs as defined in § 902.101 shall be assessed and scored based only on the physical condition of their public housing properties in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, except that properties that meet the definition specified in § 902.44(b) of physical condition and neighborhood environment shall receive one additional point for physical condition and neighborhood environment. Such agencies shall not be subject to PHAS except as noted below.

      (b)  Public housing programs operated by small rural PHAs will be assessed no more than once every three years, except that a small rural PHA shall be subject to annual inspection if it is designated by the Secretary as troubled as defined in § 902.105.

      (c)  (1) For PHAs subject to small PHA deregulation, the first assessment and inspections will be determined based on the PHA's next scheduled PHAS assessment (e.g., a higher performing PHA would receive the first inspection 3 years after the most recent PHAS assessment).

      (2) For PHAs not subject to small PHA deregulation, the first inspection is based on the PHA's overall weighted project physical condition indicator score (e.g., a PHA with a physical condition indicator score of 90 or greater would receive the first inspection three years after most recent PHAS assessment).

      § 902.105   Troubled small rural PHAs.

#### § § 902.105

      (a)  A small rural PHA will be determined to be troubled under the public housing program if the weighted average score of all property inspections is below 70 percent of the total available points, or if a small rural PHA has a weighted average score of between 70 and 80 percent of the total available points and has at least one property that receives fewer than 70 percent of the total available points.

      (b)  Upon a PHA's designation as a troubled performer HUD must notify the PHA and shall refer the troubled performer PHA to the PHA's field office, or other designated office(s) at HUD, for remedial action, oversight, and monitoring. The actions to be taken by HUD and the PHA will include statutorily required actions, and such other actions as may be determined appropriate by HUD.

      (c)  Within 30 days of notification of a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, HUD will initiate activities to negotiate and develop a CAA. A CAA is required for a troubled performer. The final CAA is a binding contractual agreement between HUD and a PHA. The scope of the CAA may vary depending upon the extent of the problems present in the PHA. The term of the CAA will not exceed one year and is subject to renewal at the discretion of HUD if HUD determines that the circumstances requiring the CAA still exist at the expiration of the term of the CAA based on the annual assessment frequency as included in § 902.103. It shall include, but not be limited to:

      (1) Baseline data, which should be data without adjustments or weighting but may be the PHA's score identified as a deficiency;

      (2) Performance targets for such periods specified by HUD (e.g., annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly), which may be the attainment of a higher score or the description of a goal to be achieved; however, safety, health, and environmental performance targets and deadlines otherwise specified by regulation, including the lead safety regulations at 24 CFR part 35, are not superseded by the CAA performance targets;

      (3) Strategies to be used by the PHA in achieving the performance targets within the time period of the CAA, including the identification of the party responsible for the completion of each task and for reporting progress;

      (4) Technical assistance to the PHA provided or facilitated by HUD;

      (5) The PHA's commitment to take all actions within its control to achieve the targets;

      (6) The consequences of failing to meet the targets; and

      (7) A description of the involvement of local public and private entities, including PHA resident leaders, in carrying out the agreement and rectifying the PHA's problems. A PHA shall have primary responsibility for obtaining active local public and private entity participation, including the involvement of public housing resident leaders, in assisting PHA improvement efforts. Local public and private entity participation should be premised upon the participant's knowledge of the PHA, ability to contribute technical expertise with regard to the PHA's specific problem areas, and authority to make preliminary commitments of support, financial or otherwise.

      (d)  The PHA will have 10 days to review the CAA. During this 10-day period, the PHA shall resolve any claimed discrepancies in the CAA with HUD and discuss any recommended changes and target dates for improvement to be incorporated in the final CAA. Unless the time period is extended by HUD, the CAA is to be executed 30 days following issuance of the draft CAA.

      (e)  Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA receives initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall improve its performance in order to no longer be considered troubled under the assessment.

      (f)  A CAA shall be executed by:

      (1) The PHA Board Chairperson (supported by a Board resolution), or a receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable) or other AME acting in lieu of the PHA Board;

      (2) The PHA Executive Director, or a designated receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable), or other AME-designated Chief Executive Officer; and

      (3) The field office.

      (g)  HUD encourages the inclusion of the resident leadership in the execution of the CAA.

      (h)  If a troubled performer PHA fails or refuses to execute an CAA within the period provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or a troubled performer PHA operating under an executed CAA does not achieve a passing physical inspection score, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the field office shall refer the PHA to the Assistant Secretary to determine such remedial actions, consistent with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, remedies available for substantial default.

      (i)  To the extent feasible, while a PHA is in a troubled performer status, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.

      § 902.107   Withholding, denying, and rescinding troubled designation.

#### § § 902.107

      (a)  In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied the requirements for high performer or non-troubled designations, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or non-troubled performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:

      (1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD (e.g., a civil rights Conciliation or Voluntary Compliance Agreement);

      (2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical performance of a PHA;

      (3) Is operating under a court order;

      (4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or

      (5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under the small rural assessment. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with Federal laws and regulations.

      (b)  If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a non-troubled performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a non-troubled performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a troubled performer.

      (c)  The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or non-troubled performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical small rural assessment score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      § 902.109   Right to petition and appeal troubled designation.

#### § § 902.109

      (a)  A PHA may take any of the following actions:

      (1) Appeal its troubled performer designation;

      (2) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation; and

      (3) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation.

      (b)  (1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in its small rural assessment score, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's score and its designation, the PHA may appeal its score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. A significant change in a score is a change that would cause the PHA's score to increase, resulting in a higher designation for the PHA ( from troubled performer to non-troubled performer, or from non-troubled to high performer).

      (2) A PHA may not appeal its score or designation based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection.

      (c)  (1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the score to the PHA.

      (2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.

      (3) An appeal of a troubled performer designation or an appeal of the denial of a petition for removal of a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of an assessment score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.

      (d)  A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under § 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.

      (e)  (1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall assessment score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.

      (2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.

      (f)  (1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, adjust the PHA's score, or perform another reexamination of information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's decision on appeal of an assessment score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.

      (2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.

      § 902.111   Sanctions for troubled small rural PHAs.

#### § § 902.111

      The sanctions for small rural PHAs with troubled public housing programs that remain troubled as required by § 902.108 will be the same as those sanctions for PHAs assessed under PHAS as described in § 902.83.

      § 902.113   Incentives for small rural PHAs high-performers.

#### § § 902.113

      (a)  PHAs with a weighted average score for all inspections of at least 90 percent of all available points will be considered high performers and will be eligible for benefits as described in § 902.113(b) and § 905.400(l) of this chapter.

      (b)  High performer small rural PHAs under the public housing program will be eligible for the same incentives as high performer PHAs under PHAS as described in § 902.71.

    Subpart A—Deconcentration of Poverty

      § 903.1   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 903.1

      The purpose of this subpart is to specify the process which a Public Housing Agency, as part of its annual planning process and development of an admissions policy, must follow in order to develop and apply a policy that provides for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in certain public housing developments.

> [80 FR 42368, July 16, 2015]

      § 903.2   With respect to admissions, what must a PHA do to deconcentrate poverty in its developments?

#### § § 903.2

      (a)  The PHA's admission policy includes the PHA's policy designed to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in accordance with section 16(a)(3)(B) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437n), which is submitted to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan process. Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing is promoted by a policy that provides for bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and lower income tenants into higher income developments.

      (1) The provisions of this section apply to applicants to and residents seeking voluntary transfers within covered public housing developments (“covered developments” as specified in paragraph (b) of this section).

      (2) The statutory requirement to design a policy to provide for deconcentration and income mixing is not to be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.

      (b) —(1)  The deconcentration requirements of this subpart apply to general occupancy, family public housing developments, excluding those developments listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Developments to which this subpart is applicable are referred to as “covered developments”.

      (2)  This subpart does not apply to the following public housing developments:

      (i) Public housing developments operated by a PHA with fewer than 100 public housing units;

      (ii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which house only elderly persons or persons with disabilities, or both;

      (iii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which consist of only one general occupancy, family public housing development;

      (iv) Public housing developments approved for demolition or for conversion to tenant-based assistance; and

      (v) Public housing developments which include public housing units operated in accordance with a HUD-approved mixed-finance plan using HOPE VI or public housing funds awarded before the effective date of this rule, provided that the PHA certifies (and includes reasons for the certification) as part of its PHA Plan (which may be accomplished either in the annual Plan submission or as a significant amendment to its PHA Plan) that exemption from the regulation is necessary to honor an existing contractual agreement or be consistent with a mixed finance plan, including provisions regarding the incomes of public housing residents to be admitted to that development, which has been developed in consultation with residents with rights to live at the affected development and other interested persons.

      (c) —(1)  To implement the statutory requirement to deconcentrate poverty and provide for income mixing in covered public housing developments, a PHA must comply with the following steps:

      (i)  A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in all the PHA's covered developments. A PHA may use median income, instead of average income, provided that the PHA includes a written explanation in its PHA Annual Plan justifying use of median income in the PHA's Annual Plan.

      (ii)  A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in each covered development. In determining average income for each development, a PHA has the option of adjusting its income analysis for unit size in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD.

      (iii)  A PHA shall determine whether each of its covered developments falls above, within or below the Established Income Range. The Established Income Range is from 85 to 115 percent (inclusive) of the average family income (the PHA-wide average income for covered developments as defined in Step 1), except that the upper limit shall never be less than the income at which a family would be defined as an extremely low income family under 24 CFR 5.603(b).

      (iv)  A PHA with covered developments having average incomes outside the Established Income Range may explain or justify the income profile for these developments as being consistent with and furthering two sets of goals: the goals of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing as specified by the statute (bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and vice versa); and the local goals and strategies contained in the PHA Annual Plan. Elements of explanations or justifications that may satisfy these requirements may include, but shall not be limited to the following:

      (A) The covered development or developments are subject to consent decrees or other resident selection and admission plans mandated by court action;

      (B) The covered development or developments are part of PHA's programs, strategies or activities specifically authorized by statute, such as mixed-income or mixed-finance developments, homeownership programs, self-sufficiency strategies, or other strategies designed to deconcentrate poverty, promote income mixing in public housing, increase the incomes of public housing residents, or the income mix is otherwise subject to individual review and approval by HUD;

      (C) The covered development's or developments' size, location, and/or configuration promote income deconcentration, such as scattered site or small developments;

      (D) The income characteristics of the covered development or developments are sufficiently explained by other circumstances.

      (v)  Where the income profile for a covered development is not explained or justified in the PHA Annual Plan submission, the PHA shall include in its admission policy its specific policy to provide for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in applicable covered developments. Depending on local circumstances, a PHA's deconcentration policy (which may be undertaken in conjunction with other efforts such as efforts to increase self-sufficiency or current residents) may include but is not limited to providing for one or more of the following actions:

      (A) Providing incentives designed to encourage families with incomes below the Established Income Range to accept units in developments with incomes above the Established Income Range, or vice versa, including rent incentives, affirmative marketing plans, or added amenities;

      (B) Targeting investment and capital improvements toward developments with an average income below the Established Income Range to encourage applicant families whose income is above the Established Income Range to accept units in those developments;

      (C) Establishing a preference for admission of working families in developments below the Established Income Range;

      (D) Skipping a family on the waiting list to reach another family in an effort to further the goals of the PHA's deconcentration policy;

      (E) Providing such other strategies as permitted by statute and determined by the PHA in consultation with the residents and the community, through the PHA Annual Plan process, to be responsive to the local context and the PHA's strategic objectives.

      (2)  HUD shall consider a PHA to be in compliance with this subpart if:

      (i) The PHA's income analysis shows that the PHA has no general occupancy family developments to which the deconcentration requirements apply; that is, the average incomes of all covered developments are within the Established Income Range;

      (ii) The PHA has covered developments with average incomes above or below the Established Income Range and the PHA provides a sufficient explanation in its Annual Plan that supports that the income mix of such development or developments is consistent with and furthers the goal of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing and also the locally determined goals of the PHA's Annual and Five Year Plans, and the PHA therefore need not take further action to deconcentrate poverty and mix incomes; or

      (iii) The PHA's deconcentration policy provides specific strategies the PHA will take that can be expected to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in developments with average incomes outside of the Established Income Range.

      (3)  If a PHA has provided that a family that resided in a covered public housing development has a right to admission to a public housing unit in that development after revitalization, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not preclude fulfilling that commitment or a PHA's commitment to return a family to another development after revitalization.

      (4)  A family has the sole discretion whether to accept an offer of a unit made under a PHA's deconcentration policy. The PHA may not take any adverse action toward any eligible family for choosing not to accept an offer of a unit under the PHA's deconcentration policy. In accordance with the PHA's established policies, the PHA may uniformly limit the number of offers received by applicants.

      (5)  Nothing in this section relieves a PHA of the obligation to meet the requirement to admit annually at least 40 percent families whose incomes are below 30 percent of area median income as provided by section 16(a)(2) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437n(a)(2).

      (d)  The requirements for poverty deconcentration in paragraph (c) of this section and for fair housing in 24 CFR 903.15(d) arise under separate statutory authorities.

    Subpart B—PHA Plans and Fair Housing Requirements

      § 903.3   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 903.3

      (a) This subpart specifies the requirements for PHA plans, required by section 5A of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437c-1) (the Act), as amended.

      (b) The purpose of the plans is to provide a strategic planning framework for PHA management operations and capital planning:

      (1) Local accountability; and

      (2) An easily identifiable source by which public housing residents, participants in the tenant-based and project-based assistance program, and other members of the public may locate basic PHA policies, rules and requirements concerning the PHA's operations, programs and services.

      (c) Title VII of the Housing and Economic Reform Act, Public Law 110-289, section 2702, amends 42 U.S.C. 1437c-1(b) to provide qualified PHAs an exemption from the requirement of section 5A of the Act to submit an annual PHA Plan. The term “qualified PHA” means a public housing agency that meets the following requirements:

      (1) The sum of the number of public housing dwelling units administered by the agency, and the number of vouchers under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) administered by the agency, is 550 or fewer; and

      (2) The agency is not designated under section 42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2) as a troubled public housing agency, and does not have a failing score under SEMAP during the prior 12 months.

> [78 FR 63770, Oct. 24, 2013, as amended at 89 FR 38292, May 7, 22024]

      § 903.4   What are the public housing agency plans?

#### § § 903.4

      (a)  There are two public housing agency plans. They are:

      (1) The 5-Year Plan (the 5-Year Plan) that a public housing agency (PHA) must submit to HUD once every five PHA fiscal years. The 5-Year Plan covers the five PHA fiscal years immediately following the date on which the 5-Year Plan is due to HUD; and

      (2) The Annual Plan (Annual Plan) that the PHA must submit to HUD for each fiscal year immediately following the date on which the Annual Plan is due to HUD and for which the PHA receives:

      (i) Section 8 assistance (tenant-based assistance (24 CFR part 982) and project-based assistance (24 CFR part 983) under Section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)); or

      (ii) Amounts from the public housing operating fund or capital fund (under section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g) (public housing)).

      (b)  HUD may prescribe the format of submission (including electronic format submission) of the plans. HUD also may prescribe the format of attachments to the plans and documents related to the plan that the PHA does not submit but may be required to make available locally. PHAs will receive appropriate notice of any prescribed format.

      (c)  The requirements of this subpart only apply to a PHA that receives the type of assistance described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d)  In addition to the waiver authority provided in § 5.110 of this title, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this title on a program-wide basis, and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)) where the Secretary determines that such waiver is necessary for the effective implementation of this part.

      § 903.5   When must a PHA submit the plans to HUD?

#### § § 903.5

      (a)  (1) The first PHA fiscal year that is covered by the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000, is the PHA fiscal year that begins October 2001. This 5-Year Plan submitted by a PHA must be submitted for the 5-year period beginning October 1, 2001.

      (2) For all PHAs, the first 5-Year Plans are due 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.

      (3) For all PHAs, after submission of their first 5-Year Plan, all subsequent 5-Year Plans must be submitted once every 5 PHA fiscal years, no later than 75 days before the commencement of the PHA's fiscal year. However, HUD may require that half of all PHAs with less than 250 public housing units submit their 5-Year Plan one fiscal year in advance (in the fourth PHA fiscal year rather than the fifth PHA fiscal year).

      (4) PHAs may choose to update their 5-Year Plans every year as good management practice and must update their 5-Year Plans that were submitted for PHA fiscal years beginning before October 1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000, at the time they submit their next Annual Plan for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2001. PHAs must explain any substantial deviation from their 5-Year Plans in their Annual Plans. (Substantial deviation is determined by the PHA in accordance with criteria provided by the PHA in its Annual Plan in accordance with § 903.7(r).)

      (b)  (1) The first PHA fiscal year that is covered by the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000 is the PHA fiscal year that begins October 1, 2001.

      (2) For all PHAs, the first Annual Plans are due 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.

      (3) For all PHAs, after submission of the first Annual Plan, all subsequent Annual Plans will be due no later than 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.

      § 903.6   What information must a PHA provide in the 5-Year Plan?

#### § § 903.6

      (a) A PHA must include in its 5-Year Plan a statement of:

      (1) The PHA's mission for serving the needs of low-income, very low-income and extremely low-income families in the PHA's jurisdiction; and

      (2) The PHA's goals and objectives that enable the PHA to serve the needs of the families identified in the PHA's Annual Plan. For HUD, the PHA and the public to better measure the success of the PHA in meeting its goals and objectives, the PHA must adopt quantifiable goals and objectives for serving those needs wherever possible.

      (3) A statement about goals, activities, objectives, policies, or programs that will enable a PHA to serve the needs of child and adult victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

      (b) After submitting its first 5-Year Plan, a PHA in its succeeding 5-Year Plans, must address:

      (1) The PHA's mission, goals and objectives for the next 5 years; and

      (2) The progress the PHA has made in meeting the goals and objectives described in the PHA's previous 5-Year Plan.

      (c) If a PHA intends to select one or more projects for project-based assistance without competition in accordance with § 983.51(c), the PHA must include a statement of this intent in its 5-Year Plan (or an amendment to the 5-Year Plan) in order to notify the public prior to making a noncompetitive selection.

      § 903.7   What information must a PHA provide in the Annual Plan?

#### § § 903.7

      With the exception of the first Annual Plan submitted by a PHA, the Annual Plan must include the information provided in this section. HUD will advise PHAs by separate notice, sufficiently in advance of the first Annual Plan due date, of the information, described in this section that must be part of the first Annual Plan submission, and any additional instructions or directions that may be necessary to prepare and submit the first Annual Plan. The information described in this section applies to public housing, tenant-based assistance, and project-based assistance except where specifically stated otherwise. The information that the PHA must submit for HUD approval under the Annual Plan includes the discretionary policies of the various plan components or elements (for example, rent policies) and not the statutory or regulatory requirements that govern these plan components and that provide no discretion on the part of the PHA in implementation of the requirements. The PHA's Annual Plan must be consistent with the goals and objectives of the PHA's 5-Year Plan.

      (a)  (1) This statement must address the housing needs of the low-income and very low-income families who reside in the jurisdiction served by the PHA, and other families who are on the public housing and Section 8 tenant-based and project-based assistance waiting lists, including:

      (i) Families meeting the definition of extremely low-income families in 24 CFR 5.603.

      (ii) Elderly families;

      (iii) Households with individuals with disabilities and households of various races and ethnic groups residing in the jurisdiction or on the waiting list.

      (2) A PHA must make reasonable efforts to identify the housing needs of each of the groups listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section based on information provided by the applicable consolidated plan, information provided by HUD, and other generally available data.

      (i) The identification of housing needs must address issues of affordability, supply, quality, accessibility, size of units, and location.

      (ii) The statement of housing needs also must describe the ways in which the PHA intends, to the maximum extent practicable, to address those needs and the PHA's reasons for choosing its strategy.

      (b)  This statement must describe the PHA's policies that govern resident or tenant eligibility, selection and admission. This statement also must describe any PHA admission preferences, and any occupancy policies that pertain to public housing units and housing units assisted under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act, as well as any unit assignment policies for public housing. This statement must include the following information:

      (1)  The PHA's deconcentration policy applicable to public housing, as described in § 903.2(a).

The statement must address any site-based waiting lists, as authorized by section 6(s) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(s)), for public housing. Section 6(s) of the 1937 Act permits PHAs to establish a system of site-based waiting lists for public housing that is consistent with all applicable civil rights and fair housing laws and regulations. Notwithstanding any other regulations, a PHA may adopt site-based waiting lists where:

      (i) The PHA regularly submits required occupancy data to HUD's Multifamily Tenant Characteristics Systems (MTCS) in an accurate, complete and timely manner;

      (ii) The system of site-based waiting lists provides for full disclosure to each applicant of any option available to the applicant in the selection of the development in which to reside, including basic information about available sites (location, occupancy, number and size of accessible units, amenities such as day care, security, transportation and training programs) and an estimate of the period of time the applicant would likely have to wait to be admitted to units of different sizes and types (e.g., regular or accessible) at each site;

      (iii) Adoption of site-based waiting lists would not violate any court order or settlement agreement, or be inconsistent with a pending complaint brought by HUD;

      (iv) The PHA includes reasonable measures to assure that adoption of site-based waiting lists is consistent with affirmatively furthering fair housing, such as reasonable marketing activities to attract applicants regardless of race or ethnicity;

      (v) The PHA provides for review of its site-based waiting list policy to determine if the policy is consistent with civil rights laws and certifications through the following steps:

      (A) As part of the submission of the Annual Plan, the PHA shall assess changes in racial, ethnic or disability-related tenant composition at each PHA site that may have occurred during the implementation of the site-based waiting list, based upon MTCS occupancy data that has been confirmed to be complete and accurate by an independent audit (which may be the annual independent audit) or is otherwise satisfactory to HUD;

      (B) At least every three years the PHA uses independent testers or other means satisfactory to HUD, to assure that the site-based waiting list is not being implemented in a discriminatory manner, and that no patterns or practices of discrimination exist, and providing the results to HUD;

      (C) Taking any steps necessary to remedy the problems surfaced during the review; and

      (D) Taking the steps necessary to affirmatively further fair housing.

      (3)  The PHA's admission policies that include any other PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admissions for the public housing (see part 960 of this title) and tenant-based assistance programs (see part 982, subpart E of this title) and project-based assistance programs (see part 982, subpart E of this title except as provided in § 983.3, and subpart F of 983). (The information requested on site-based waiting lists and deconcentration is applicable only to public housing.)

      (c)  This statement must address the financial resources that are available to the PHA for the support of Federal public housing, tenant-based assistance, and project-based assistance programs administered by the PHA during the plan year. The statement must include a listing, by general categories, of the PHA's anticipated resources, such as PHA operating, capital and other anticipated Federal resources available to the PHA, as well as tenant rents and other income available to support public housing, tenant-based assistance, and project-based assistance. The statement also should include the non-Federal sources of funds supporting each Federal program, and state the planned uses for the resources.

      (d)  This statement must describe the PHA's basic discretionary policies that govern rents charged for public housing units, applicable flat rents, and the rental contributions of families receiving tenant-based assistance and project-based assistance. For tenant-based assistance and project-based assistance, this statement also shall cover any discretionary minimum tenant rents and payment standard policies.

      (e)  (1) This statement must list the PHA's rules, standards, and policies that govern maintenance and management of housing owned, assisted, or operated by the PHA.

      (2) The policies listed in this statement must include a description of any measures necessary for the prevention or eradication of pest infestation. Pest infestation includes cockroach infestation.

      (3) This statement must include a description of PHA management organization, and a listing of the programs administered by the PHA.

      (4) The information requested on a PHA's rules, standards and policies regarding management and maintenance of housing applies only to public housing. The information requested on PHA program management and listing of administered programs applies to public housing, tenant-based assistance, and project-based assistance.

      (f)  This statement describes the grievance and informal hearing and review procedures that the PHA makes available to its residents and applicants. These procedures include public housing grievance procedures, tenant-based assistance, and project-based assistance informal review procedures for applicants and hearing procedures for participants.

      (g)  With respect to public housing only, this statement describes the capital improvements necessary to ensure long-term physical and social viability of the PHA's public housing developments, including the capital improvements to be undertaken in the year in question and their estimated costs, and any other information required for participation in the Capital Fund. PHAs also are required to include 5-Year Plans covering large capital items.

The application and approval process for demolition and/or disposition is a separate process. Approval of the PHA Plan does not constitute approval of these activities.

      (2)  (i) Before submission of the first Annual Plan, a PHA may submit an interim PHA Annual Plan solely for demolition/disposition. The interim plan must provide:

      (A) The required description of the action to be taken;

      (E) Confirmation that a public hearing was held on the proposed action and that the resident advisory board was consulted.

      (ii) Interim plans for demolition/disposition are subject to PHA Plan procedural requirements in this part (see §§ 903.13, 903.15, 903.17, 903.19, 903.21, 903.23, 903.25), with the following exception. If a resident advisory board has not yet been formed, the PHA may seek a waiver of the requirement to consult with the resident advisory board on the grounds that organizations that adequately represent residents for this purpose were consulted.

      (iii) The actual application for demolition or disposition may be submitted at the same time as submission of the interim plan or at a later date.

      (i)  (1) With respect to public housing only, this statement identifies any public housing developments owned, assisted, or operated by the PHA, or any portion of these developments, that:

      (2) The designated housing application and approval process is a separate process. Approval of the PHA Plan does not constitute approval of these activities.

      (j)  (1) This statement describes:

      (i) Any building or buildings that the PHA is required to convert to tenant-based assistance under section 33 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5);

      (ii) The status of any building or buildings that the PHA may be required to convert to tenant-based assistance under section 202 of the Fiscal Year 1996 HUD Appropriations Act (42 U.S.C. 14371 note); or

      § 903.13   What is a Resident Advisory Board and what is its role in development of the Annual Plan?

#### § § 903.13

      (a) A Resident Advisory Board refers to a board or boards, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whose membership consists of individuals who adequately reflect and represent the residents assisted by the PHA.

      (1) The role of the Resident Advisory Board (or Resident Advisory Boards) is to assist and make recommendations regarding the development of the PHA plan, and any significant amendment or modification to the PHA plan.

      (2) The PHA shall allocate reasonable resources to assure the effective functioning of Resident Advisory Boards. Reasonable resources for the Resident Advisory Boards must provide reasonable means for them to become informed on programs covered by the PHA Plan, to communicate in writing and by telephone with assisted families and hold meetings with those families, and to access information regarding covered programs on the internet, taking into account the size and resources of the PHA.

      (b) Each PHA must establish one or more Resident Advisory Boards, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (1) If a jurisdiction-wide resident council exists that complies with the tenant participation regulations in part 964 of this title, the PHA shall appoint the jurisdiction-wide resident council or the council's representatives as the Resident Advisory Board. If the PHA makes such appointment, the members of the jurisdiction-wide resident council or the council's representatives shall be added or another Resident Advisory Board formed to provide for reasonable representation of families receiving tenant-based assistance and/or project-based assistance where such representation is required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) If a jurisdiction-wide resident council does not exist but resident councils exist that comply with the tenant participation regulations, the PHA shall appoint such resident councils or their representatives to serve on one or more Resident Advisory Boards. If the PHA makes such appointment, the PHA may require that the resident councils choose a limited number of representatives.

      (3) Where the PHA has a tenant-based assistance and/or project-based assistance program of significant size (where tenant-based assistance and/or project-based assistance is 20% or more of assisted households), the PHA shall assure that the Resident Advisory Board (or Boards) has reasonable representation of families receiving tenant-based assistance and/or project-based assistance and that a reasonable process is undertaken to choose this representation.

      (4) Where or to the extent that resident councils that comply with the tenant participation regulations do not exist, the PHA shall appoint Resident Advisory Boards or Board members as needed to adequately reflect and represent the interests of residents of such developments; provided that the PHA shall provide reasonable notice to such residents and urge that they form resident councils with the tenant participation regulations.

      (c) The PHA must consider the recommendations of the Resident Advisory Board or Boards in preparing the final Annual Plan, and any significant amendment or modification to the Annual Plan, as provided in § 903.21 of this title.

      (1) In submitting the final plan to HUD for approval, or any significant amendment or modification to the plan to HUD for approval, the PHA must include a copy of the recommendations made by the Resident Advisory Board or Boards and a description of the manner in which the PHA addressed these recommendations.

      (2) Notwithstanding the 75-day limitation on HUD review, in response to a written request from a Resident Advisory Board claiming that the PHA failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment, HUD may make a finding of good cause during the required time period and require the PHA to remedy the failure before final approval of the plan.

      § 903.15   What is the relationship of the public housing agency plans to the Consolidated Plan and a PHA's Fair Housing Requirements?

#### § § 903.15

      (a) The PHA must ensure that the Annual Plan is consistent with any applicable Consolidated Plan for the jurisdiction in which the PHA is located.

      (1) The PHA must submit a certification by the appropriate State or local officials that the Annual Plan is consistent with the Consolidated Plan and include a description of the manner in which the applicable plan contents are consistent with the Consolidated Plans.

      (2) For State agencies that are PHAs, the applicable Consolidated Plan is the State Consolidated Plan.

      (b) A PHA may request to change its fiscal year to better coordinate its planning with the planning done under the Consolidated Plan process, by the State or local officials, as applicable.

      (c)  A PHA is obligated to affirmatively further fair housing in its operating policies, procedures, and capital activities. All admission and occupancy policies for public housing and Section 8 tenant-based and project-based housing programs must comply with Fair Housing Act requirements and other civil rights laws and regulations and with a PHA's plans to affirmatively further fair housing. The PHA may not impose any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.

      (1)  A PHA must carry out its PHA Plan in conformity with the nondiscrimination requirements in Federal civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Fair Housing Act. A PHA may not assign housing to persons in a particular section of a community or to a development or building based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin for purposes of segregating populations.

      (2)  A PHA's policies should be designed to reduce the concentration of tenants and other assisted persons by race, national origin, and disability. Any affirmative steps or incentives a PHA plans to take must be stated in the admission policy.

      (i) HUD regulations provide that PHAs must take steps to affirmatively further fair housing. PHA policies should include affirmative steps to overcome the effects of discrimination and the effects of conditions that resulted in limiting participation of persons because of their race, national origin, disability, or other protected class.

      (ii) Such affirmative steps may include, but are not limited to, marketing efforts, use of nondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment policies that lead to desegregation, additional applicant consultation and information, provision of additional supportive services and amenities to a development (such as supportive services that enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community), and engagement in ongoing coordination with state and local disability agencies to provide additional community-based housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities and to connect such individuals with supportive services to enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community.

      (3)  (i) A PHA's certification under § 903.7(o) will be subject to challenge by HUD where it appears that a PHA:

      (A) Fails to meet the affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements at 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.152

      (B) Takes action that is materially inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing; or

      (C) Fails to meet the fair housing, civil rights, and affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements in 24 CFR 903.7(o).

      (ii) If HUD challenges the validity of a PHA's certification, HUD will do so in writing specifying the deficiencies, and will give the PHA an opportunity to respond to the particular challenge in writing. In responding to the specified deficiencies, a PHA must establish, as applicable, that it has complied with fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, or has remedied violations of fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, and has adopted policies and undertaken actions to affirmatively further fair housing, including, but not limited to, providing a full range of housing opportunities to applicants and tenants in a nondiscriminatory manner. In responding to the PHA, HUD may accept the PHA's explanation and withdraw the challenge, undertake further investigation, or pursue other remedies available under law. HUD will seek to obtain voluntary corrective action consistent with the specified deficiencies. In determining whether a PHA has complied with its certification, HUD will review the PHA's circumstances relevant to the specified deficiencies, including characteristics of the population served by the PHA; characteristics of the PHA's existing housing stock; and decisions, plans, goals, priorities, strategies, and actions of the PHA, including those designed to affirmatively further fair housing.

      § 903.19   When is the 5-Year Plan or Annual Plan ready for submission to HUD?

#### § § 903.19

      A PHA may adopt its 5-Year Plan or its Annual Plan and submit the plan to HUD for approval only after:

      (a) The PHA has conducted the public hearing;

      (b) The PHA has considered all public comments received on the plan;

      (c) The PHA has made any changes to the plan, based on comments, after consultation with the Resident Advisory Board or other resident organization.

#### § § 903.21

      (a) A PHA, after submitting its 5-Year Plan or Annual Plan to HUD, may amend or modify any PHA policy, rule, regulation or other aspect of the plan. If the amendment or modification is a significant amendment or modification, as defined in § 903.7(r)(2), the PHA:

      (1) May not adopt the amendment or modification until the PHA has duly called a meeting of its board of directors (or similar governing body) and the meeting, at which the amendment or modification is adopted, is open to the public; and

      (2) May not implement the amendment or modification, until notification of the amendment or modification is provided to HUD and approved by HUD in accordance with HUD's plan review procedures, as provided in § 903.23.

      (b) Each significant amendment or modification to a plan submitted to HUD is subject to the requirements of §§ 903.13, 903.15, and 903.17.

      § 903.23   What is the process by which HUD reviews, approves, or disapproves an Annual Plan?

#### § § 903.23

      (a)  When the PHA submits its Annual Plan to HUD, including any significant amendment or modification to the plan, HUD reviews the plan to determine whether:

      (2) The plan is consistent with the information and data available to HUD;

      (3) The plan is consistent with any applicable Consolidated Plan for the jurisdiction in which the PHA is located; and

      (b)  HUD's review of the Annual Plan (and any significant amendments or modifications to the plan) will be limited to the information required by § 903.7(b), (g), (h), and (o), and any other element of the PHA's Annual Plan that is challenged.

      (c)  (1) HUD may disapprove a PHA plan, in its entirety or with respect to any part, or disapprove any significant amendment or modification to the plan, only if HUD determines that the plan, or one of its components or elements, or any significant amendment or modification to the plan:

      (i) Does not provide all the information that is required to be included in the plan;

      (ii) Is not consistent with the information and data available to HUD;

      (iii) Is not consistent with any applicable Consolidated Plan for the jurisdiction in which the PHA is located; or

      (iv) Is not consistent with applicable Federal laws and regulations.

      (2) Not later than 75 days after the date on which the PHA submits its plan or significant amendment or modification to the plan, HUD will issue written notice to the PHA if the plan or a significant amendment or modification has been disapproved. The notice that HUD issues to the PHA must state with specificity the reasons for the disapproval. HUD may not state as a reason for disapproval the lack of time to review the plan.

      (3) If HUD fails to issue the notice of disapproval on or before the 75th day after the date on which the PHA submits its plan or significant amendment or modification to the plan, HUD shall be considered to have determined that all elements or components of the plan required to be submitted and that were submitted, and to be reviewed by HUD were in compliance with applicable requirements and the plan has been approved.

      (4) The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section do not apply to troubled PHAs. The plan of a troubled PHA must be approved or disapproved by HUD through written notice.

      (d)  For purposes of the 75-day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, the first 5-year and Annual Plans submitted by a PHA will be considered to have been submitted no earlier than the due date as provided in § 903.5.

      (e)  Once a PHA's plan has been approved, a PHA must make the approved plan and the required attachments and documents related to the plan, available for review and inspection, at the principal office of the PHA during normal business hours.

      (f)  PHAs must maintain records reflecting actions to affirmatively further fair housing pursuant to §§ 5.151, 5.152, and 903.7(o) of this title.

      § 903.25   How does HUD ensure PHA compliance with its plan?

#### § § 903.25

      A PHA must comply with the rules, standards and policies established in the plans. To ensure that a PHA is in compliance with all policies, rules, and standards adopted in the plan approved by HUD, HUD shall, as it deems appropriate, respond to any complaint concerning PHA noncompliance with its plan. If HUD should determine that a PHA is not in compliance with its plan, HUD will take whatever action it deems necessary and appropriate.

    Subpart A—Introduction to Low-Rent Housing Homeownership Opportunity Program [Reserved]

    Subpart B—Turnkey III Program Description

      § 904.101   Introduction.

#### § § 904.101

      (a)  This subpart sets forth the essential elements of the HUD Homeownership Opportunities Program for Low-Income Families (Turnkey III).

      (b)  This subpart is applicable to Turnkey III developments operated by LHA. For Turnkey III developments operated by an Indian Housing Authority, applicable provisions are found at 24 CFR part 905, subpart G.

      (1) With respect to any development to be operated as Turnkey III, the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) shall contain the “Special Provisions for Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Project” as set forth in Appendix I. A Turnkey III development may include only units which are to be operated as such under Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreements. If for any reason it is determined that certain units should be operated as conventional rental units, such units must comprise or be made part of a conventional rental project.

      (2) With respect to Turnkey III developments pursuant to an executed ACC where no Agreements with Homebuyers have been signed, the ACC shall be amended (i) to include the “Special Provisions” set forth in Appendix I, (ii) to extend its term to 30 years, and (iii) to reduce its Maximum Contribution Percentage to a rate that will amortize the debt in 30 years at the minimum Loan Interest Rate specified in the ACC for the specific Turnkey III project involved. Further development and operation shall be in accordance with this subpart including use of the form of Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement set forth in Appendix II.

      (3) With respect to developments where Agreements with homebuyers have been signed, the following steps shall be taken:

      (i) The ACC shall be amended to include the Special Provisions” set forth in Appendix I; further development and operation of the Project shall be in accordance with this subpart.

      (ii) The LHA shall offer all qualified homebuyers in the development a new Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement as set forth in Appendix II with an amendment to section 16a to refer to “the latest approved Development Cost Budget, or Actual Development Cost Certificate if issued,” in lieu of “the Development Cost Budget in effect upon award of the Main Construction Contract or execution of the Contract of Sale,” and, if the ACC for the Project has a term of 25 years, an amendment to section 16(b) to refer to a term of 25 years, instead of 30, for the Purchase Price Schedule. Each Purchase Price Schedule shall commence with the first day of the month following the effective date of the initial Agreement. No other modification in the new Agreement may be made. In the event the homebuyer refuses to accept the new Agreement, no modifications may be made in the old Agreement and the matter shall be referred to HUD.

      (4) With respect to Projects which were under ACC on the effective date of this subpart, the Total Development Cost Budget shall be revised, if financially feasible, to include the cost of the appraisals which are necessary for computation of the initial purchase prices pursuant to § 904.113. In the event this is not financially feasible, the matter shall be referred to HUD, which may, if necessary, authorize a different method for computation of such initial purchase prices on an equitable basis.

      (5) With respect to all developments which were completed by the effective date of this subpart, the appraisals which are necessary for computation of the initial purchase prices pursuant to § 904.113 shall be made as of the date of completion of the development.

      § 904.102   Definitions.

#### § § 904.102

      (a) The term  means the nondwelling structures and equipment, common areas, community facilities, and in some cases certain component parts of dwelling structures, which are contained in the development:  That in the case of a development that is organized as a condominium or a planned unit development (PUD), the term  shall have the meaning established by the condominium or PUD documents and the State law pursuant to which the condominium or PUD is organized, under the terms  or other similar terms.

      (b) The term  means the entire undertaking including all real and personal property, funds and reserves, rights, interests and obligations, and activities related thereto.

      (c) The term  means the Earned Home Payments Account established and maintained pursuant to § 904.110.

      (d) The term  means the member or members of a low-income family who have executed a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement with the LHA.

      (e) The term  (HBA) means an organization as defined in § 904.106.

      (f) The term  means a homebuyer who has acquired title to his home.

      (g) The term  means an association comprised of homeowners, including condominium associations, having responsibilities with respect to common property.

      (h) The term  means the local housing authority which acquires or develops a low-rent housing development with financial assistance from HUD, owns the homes until title is transferred to the homebuyers, and is responsible for the management of the homeownership opportunity program.

      (i) The term  means the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve established and maintained pursuant to § 904.111.

      (j) The term  is used to refer to the development in relation to matters specifically related to the Annual Contributions Contract.

      § 904.103   Development.

#### § § 904.103

      (a)  The LHA shall finance development or acquisition by sale of its notes (bond financing shall not be used) in the amount of the Minimum Development Cost. Payment of the debt service on the notes is assured by the HUD commitment to provide annual contributions.

      (b)  The maximum total development cost stated in the ACC is the maximum amount authorized for development of a project and shall not exceed the amount approved in accordance with § 941.406(a) of this chapter.

      (c)  There are three basic contracts:

      (1) An Annual Contributions Contract containing “Special Provisions For Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Project,” Form HUD-53010C (see Appendix I);

      (2) A Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement (see Appendix II) which sets forth the respective rights and obligations of the low-income occupants and the LHA, including conditions for achieving homeownership; and

      (3) A Recognition Agreement (see Appendix II of Subpart D of this part) between the LHA and the HBA under which the LHA agrees to recognize the HBA as the established representative of the homebuyers.

      (d)  (). In the necessary development of citizens' participation in and understanding of the Turnkey III program, the LHA should consider formation and use of a _CPC_ to assist the community and the LHA in the development and support of the Turnkey III program. The CPC shall be a voluntary group comprised of representatives of the low-income population primarily and may also include representatives of community service organizations.

      § 904.104   Eligibility and selection of homebuyers.

#### § § 904.104

      (a)  (1) The availability of housing under Turnkey III shall be announced to the community at large. Families on the waiting list for LHA conventional rental housing who wish to be considered for Turnkey III must apply specifically for that program (see paragraph (d) of this section).

      (2) The LHA shall submit to HUD an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations, 24 CFR part 200, subpart M, as if the LHA were an applicant for participation in an FHA housing program. This Plan shall be submitted with the development program, and no development program may be approved without prior approval of the Plan pursuant to HUD procedures under said Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations. If the development program has been approved, but the Annual Contributions Contract has not been executed, prior to the effective date of this subpart, an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan must be approved prior to execution of said contract.

      (b)  (1) Homebuyers shall be lower income families that are determined to be eligible for admission in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR parts 5 and 913, which prescribe income definitions, income limits, and restrictions concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status. The HUD-approved standards for admission to low-rent housing, including the LHA's established priorities and preferences and the requirements for administration of low-rent housing under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 42 U.S.C. 2000d), shall be applicable except that the procedures used for homebuyer selection under Turnkey III shall be those set forth in this section. In carrying out these procedures the aim shall be to provide for equal housing opportunity in such a way as to prevent segregation or other discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 42 U.S.C. 2000d) and 1968 (Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73, 42 U.S.C. 3601).

      (2) An LHA may establish income limits for Turnkey III which are different from those for its conventional rental program:  That those limits are in accord with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements and are approved by HUD.

      (c)  The LHA, without participation of a recommending committee (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section), must determine the eligibility of each applicant family in respect to the income limits for the development (including the requirement that the applicant family disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 750, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 760), and must then assign each eligible applicant its appropriate place on a waiting list for the development, in sequence based upon the date of the application, suitable type or size of unit, qualification for a Federal preference in accordance with § 904.122, and factors affecting preference or priority established by the LHA's regulations. Notwithstanding the fact that the LHA may not be accepting additional applications because of the length of the waiting list, the LHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for participation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in § 904.122(c)(2), unless the LHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions to housing under Turnkey III, that—

      (1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference, and

      (2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the LHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for admission before other applicants on the waiting list.

      (d)  A separate list of applicants for Turnkey III shall be maintained, consisting of families who specifically apply and are eligible for admission to such housing.

      (1)  All applications for Turnkey III shall be dated as received.

      (2)  The filing of an application for Turnkey III by a family which is an applicant for LHA conventional rental housing or is an occupant of such housing shall in no way affect its status with regard to such rental housing. Such an applicant shall not lose his place on the rental housing waiting list until his application is accepted for Turnkey III and shall not receive any different treatment or consideration with respect to conventional rental housing because of having applied for Turnkey III.

      (e) —(1)  The LHA should consider use of a recommending committee to assist in the establishment of objective criteria for the determination of potential for homeownership and in the selection of homebuyers from the families determined to have such potential. If a recommending committee is used, it should be composed of representatives of the CPC (if any), the LHA and the HBA. The LHA shall submit to the committee prompt written justification of any rejection of a committee recommendation, stating grounds, the reasonableness of which shall be in accord with applicable LHA and HUD regulations. Each member of such a committee, at the time of appointment, shall be required to furnish the LHA with a signed statement that the member will (i) follow selection procedures and policies that do not automatically deny admission to a particular class, that insure selection on a nondiscriminatory and nonsegregated basis, and that facilitate achievement of the anticipated results for occupancy stated in the approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, and (ii) maintain strict confidentiality by not divulging any information concerning applicants or the deliberations of the committee to any person except to the LHA as necessary for purposes of the official business of the committee.

      (2)  In order to be considered for selection, a family must be determined to meet at least all of the following standards of potential for homeownership:

      (i) Income sufficient to result in a required monthly payment which is not less than the sum of the amounts necessary to pay the EHPA, the NRMR, and the estimated average monthly cost of utilities attributable to the home;

      (ii) Ability to meet all the obligations of a homebuyer under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;

      (iii) At least one member gainfully employed, or having an established source of continuing income.

      (f)  Homebuyers shall be selected from those families determined to have potential for homeownership. Such selection shall be made in sequence from the waiting list established in accordance with this section, provided that the following shall be assured:

      (1) Selection procedures that do not automatically deny admission to a particular class; that ensure selection on a nondiscriminatory and nonsegregated basis; that give a Federal preference in accordance with § 904.122; and that facilitate achievement of the anticipated results for occupancy stated in the approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan.

      (2) Achievement of an average monthly payment for the Project, including consideration of the availability of the Special Family Subsidy, which is at least 10 percent more than the breakeven amount for the Project (see § 904.108). This standard shall be complied with both in the initial selection of homebuyers and in the subsequent filling of vacancies at all times during the life of the Project. If there is an applicant who has potential for homeownership but whose required monthly payment under the LHA's Rent Schedule would be less than the break-even amount for the suitable size and type of unit, such applicant may be selected as a homebuyer, provided that the incomes of all selected homebuyers shall result in the required average monthly payment of at least 10 percent more than the break-even amount for the Project. Such an average monthly payment for the Project may be achieved by selecting other low-income families who can afford to make required monthly payments substantially above the break-even amounts for their suitable sizes and types of units.

      (g)  (1) Once a sufficient number of applicants have been selected to assure that the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section are met, the selected applicant shall be notified of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as such date can reasonably be determined.

      (2) Applicants who are not selected for a specific Turnkey III development shall be notified in accordance with HUD-approved procedure. The notice shall state:

      (i) The reason for the applicant's rejection (including a nonrecommendation by the recommending committee unless the applicant has previously been so notified by the committee);

      (ii) That the applicant will be given an information hearing on such determination, regardless of the reason for the rejection, if the applicant makes a request for such a hearing within a reasonable time (to be specified in the notice) from the date of the notice; and

      (iii) For denial of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, the applicant may request, in addition to the informal hearing, an appeal to the INS, in accordance with 24 CFR part 5.

      (h)  (1) A homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the LHA determines that the homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the current amount of the homebuyer's Total Tenant Payment, determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter, equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section). In such event, if the LHA determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the LHA shall notify the homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the home or (ii) move from the development. If, however, the LHA determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe, and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent an amount equal to Tenant Rent, as determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.

      (2) The term “monthly housing cost,” as used in this paragraph, means the sum of:

      (i) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the homebuyer can purchase the home by the method described in § 904.113(c)(1) of this part);

      (ii) One-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the homebuyer will be required to pay as a homeowner;

      (iii) One-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the LHA with respect to the home;

      (iv) The current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA), and for routine maintenance-common property; and

      (v) The current LHA and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the LHA.

      § 904.105   Counseling of homebuyers.

#### § § 904.105

      The LHA shall provide counseling and training as provided in subpart C of this part, with funding as provided in § 904.206 of this part. Applicants for admission shall be advised of the nature of the counseling and training program available to them and the application for admission shall include a statement that the family agrees to participate and cooperate fully in all official pre-occupancy and post-occupancy training and counseling activities. Failure to participate as agreed may result in the family not being selected or retained as a homebuyer.

      § 904.106   Homebuyers Association (HBA).

#### § § 904.106

      An HBA is an incorporated organization composed of all the families who are entitled to occupancy pursuant to a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement or who are homeowners. It is formed and organized for the purposes set forth in § 904.304 of this part. The HBA shall be funded as provided in § 904.305 of this part. In the absence of a duly organized HBA, the LHA shall be free to act without the HBA action required by this subpart.

      § 904.107   Responsibilities of homebuyer.

#### § § 904.107

      (a)  The homebuyer shall be responsible for the routine maintenance of the home to the satisfaction of the HBA and the LHA. This routine maintenance includes the work (labor and materials) of keeping the dwelling structure, grounds and equipment in good repair, condition and appearance so that they may be utilized continually at their designed capacities and at the satisfactory level of efficiency for their intended purposes, and in conformity with the requirements of local housing code and applicable regulations and guidelines of HUD. It includes repairs (labor and materials) to the dwelling structure, plumbing fixtures, dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), shades and screens, water heater, heating equipment and other component parts of the dwelling. It also includes all interior painting and the maintenance of grounds (lot) on which the dwelling is located. It does not include maintenance and replacements provided for by the NRMR described in § 904.111.

      (b)  In addition to the obligation for routine maintenance, the homebuyer shall be responsible for repair of any damage caused by him, members of his family, or visitors.

      (c)  A homebuyer shall keep the home in a sanitary condition; cooperate with the LHA and the HBA in keeping and maintaining the common areas and property, including fixtures and equipment, in good condition and appearance; and follow all rules of the LHA and of the HBA concerning the use and care of the dwellings and the common areas and property.

      (d)  A homebuyer shall agree to permit officials, employees, or agents of the LHA and of the HBA to inspect the home at reasonable hours and intervals in accordance with rules established by the LHA and the HBA.

      (e)  A homebuyer shall not (1) sublet the home without the prior written approval of the LHA and HUD, (2) use or occupy the home for any unlawful purpose nor for any purpose deemed hazardous by insurance companies on account of fire or other risks, or (3) provide accommodations (unless approved by the HBA and the LHA) to boarders or lodgers. The homebuyer shall agree to use the home only as a place to live for the family (as identified in the initial application or by subsequent amendment with the approval of the LHA), for children thereafter born to or adopted by members of such family, and for aged or widowed parents of the homebuyer or spouse who may join the household.

      (f)  Neither the homebuyer nor any member of his family shall interfere with rights of other occupants of the development, or damage the common property or the property of others, or create physical hazards.

      (g)  A homebuyer shall not make any structural changes in or additions to the home unless the LHA has first determined in writing that such change would not (1) impair the value of the unit, the surrounding units, or the development as a whole, or (2) affect the use of the home for residential purposes, or (3) violate HUD requirements as to construction and design.

      (h)  When each homebuyer moves in, the LHA shall inspect the home and shall give the homebuyer a written statement, to be signed by the LHA and the homebuyer, of the condition of the home and the equipment in it. Should the homebuyer vacate the home, the LHA shall inspect it and give the homebuyer a written statement of the repairs and other work, if any, required to put the home in good condition for the next occupant (see § 904.110(j)(1)). The homebuyer, his representative, and a representative of the HBA may join in any such inspections by the LHA.

      (i)  The homebuyer may participate in nonroutine maintenance of his home and in maintenance of common property as discussed in § 904.110(d) and § 904.111(c).

      (j)  (1) The term “required monthly payment” as used herein means the monthly payment the homebuyer is required to pay the LHA on or before the first day of each month. The homebuyer's required monthly payment, which is based upon family income, shall be an amount equal to the Tenant Rent as determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter. If the Utility Allowance, as defined in part 913 of this chapter, exceeds the Homebuyer's Total Tenant Payment, as determined in accordance with part 913, the LHA will pay a utility reimbursement equal to that excess to the Homebuyer, or as provided in § 913.108 of this chapter.

      (2) For purposes of determining eligibility of an applicant (see 24 CFR parts 5 and 913, as well as this part) and the amount of Homebuyer payments under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the LHA shall examine the family's income and composition and follow the procedures required by 24 CFR part 5 for determining citizenship or eligible immigration status before initial occupancy. Thereafter, for the purposes stated in this paragraph and to determine whether a Homebuyer is required to purchase the home under § 904.104(h)(1), the LHA shall reexamine the Homebuyer's income and composition regularly, at least once every 12 months, and shall undertake such further determination and verification of citizenship or eligible immigration status as required by 24 CFR part 5. The Homebuyer shall comply with the LHA's policy regarding required interim reporting of changes in the family's income and composition. If the LHA receives information from the family or other source concerning a change in the family income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the LHA, upon consultation with the family and verification of the information (in accordance with 24 CFR parts 5 and 913 of this chapter) shall promptly make any adjustments determined to be appropriate in the Homebuyer payment amount or take appropriate action concerning the addition of a family member who is not a citizen with eligible immigration status. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent must be verified.

      (3) The LHA shall not refuse to accept monthly payments because of any other charges (other than overdue monthly payments) owed by the homebuyer to the LHA; however, by accepting monthly payments under such circumstances the LHA shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies with respect to such other charges.

      (k)  The LHA shall apply the homebuyer's monthly payment as follows:

      (1) To the credit of the homebuyer's EHPA (see § 904.110);

      (2) To the credit of the homebuyer's NRMR (see § 904.111); and

      (3) For payment of monthly operating expense including contribution to operating reserve (see § 904.109).

      (l)  Until such time as the homebuyer obtains title to the home, it shall be used only to house a family of low income. Therefore:

      (1) A homebuyer shall not assign any right or interest in the home or under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement without the prior written approval of the LHA and HUD;

      (2) In the event of death, mental incapacity or abandonment of the family by the homebuyer, the person designated as the successor in the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement shall succeed to the rights and responsibilities under the Agreement if that person is an occupant of the home at the time of the event and is determined by the LHA to meet all of the standards of potential for homeownership as set forth in § 904.104(e)(2). Such person shall be designated by the homebuyer at the time the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is executed. This designation may be changed by the homebuyer at any time. If there is no such designation or the designee is no longer an occupant of the home or does not meet the standards of potential for homeownership, the LHA may consider as the homebuyer any family member who was an occupant at the time of the event and who meets the standards of potential for homeownership.

      (3) If there is no qualified successor in accordance with paragraph (l) (2) of this section, the LHA shall terminate the Agreement and another family shall be selected except under the following circumstances: where a minor child or children of the homebuyer family are in occupancy, then in order to protect their continued occupancy and opportunity for acquisition of ownership of the home, the LHA may approve as occupants of the unit, an appropriate adult(s) who has been appointed legal guardian of the children with a duty to perform the obligations of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement in their interest and behalf.

      (m)  (1) In the event the homebuyer breaches the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement by failure to make the required monthly payment within ten days after its due date, by misrepresenting or withholding of information in applying for admission or in connection with any subsequent reexamination of income and family composition (including the failure to submit any required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status, as provided by 24 CFR part 5; the failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5; or the failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or by failure to comply with any of the other homebuyer obligations under the Agreement, the LHA may terminate the Agreement. No termination under this paragraph may occur less than 30 days after the LHA gives the homebuyer notice of its intention to do so, in accordance with paragraph (m)(3) of this section. For termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status under 24 CFR part 5, the requirements of 24 CFR parts 5 and 966 shall apply.

      (2) Notice of termination by the LHA shall be in writing. Such notice shall state

      (i) The reason for termination,

      (ii) That the homebuyer may respond to the LHA, in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable period of time regarding the reason for termination,

      (iii) That in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice, including a representative of the HBA,

      (iv) That the LHA will consult the HBA concerning this termination, and

      (v) That unless the LHA rescinds or modifies the notice, the termination shall be effective at the end of the 30-day notice period.

      (n)  The homebuyer may terminate the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement by giving the LHA 30 days notice in writing of this intention to terminate and vacate the home. In the event that the homebuyer vacates the home without notice to the LHA, the Agreement shall be terminated automatically and the LHA may dispose of, in any manner deemed suitable by it, any items of personal property left by the homebuyer in the home.

      (o)  (1) Inasmuch as the homebuyer was found eligible for admission to the Project on the basis of having the necessary elements of potential for homeownership, continuation of eligibility requires continuation of this potential, subject only to temporary unforeseen changes in circumstances. Accordingly, in the event it should develop that the homebuyer no longer meets one or more of these elements of homeownership potential, the LHA shall investigate the circumstances and provide such counseling and assistance as may be feasible in order to help the family overcome the deficiency as promptly as possible. After a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the investigation, the LHA shall make a re-evaluation as to whether the family has regained the potential for homeownership or is likely to do so within a further reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the reevaluation. Further extension of time may be granted in exceptional cases, but in any event, a final determination shall be made no later than 90 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the initial investigation. The LHA shall invite the HBA to participate in all investigations and evaluations.

      (2) If the final determination of the LHA, after considering the views of the HBA, is that the homebuyer should be transferred to a suitable dwelling unit in an LHA rental project, the LHA shall give the homebuyer written notice of the LHA determination of the loss of homeownership potential and of the offer of transfer to a rental unit. The notice shall state that the transfer shall occur as soon as a suitable rental unit is available for occupancy, but no earlier than 30 days from the date of the notice, provided that an eligible successor for the homebuyer unit has been selected by the LHA. The notice shall also state that if the homebuyer should refuse to move under such circumstances, the family may be required to vacate the homebuyer unit, without further notice. The notice shall include a statement (i) that the homebuyer may respond to the LHA in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable time, regarding the reason for the determination and offer of transfer, (ii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice including a representative of the HBA, and (iii) that the LHA has consulted the HBA concerning this determination and offer of transfer.

      (3) When a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph (o), the amount in the homebuyer's EHPA shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of § 904.110(j).

      § 904.108   Break-even amount.

#### § § 904.108

      (a)  The term “break-even amount” as used herein means the minimum average monthly amount required to provide funds for the items listed in the illustration below. A separate break-even amount shall be established for each size and type of dwelling unit, as well as for the Project as a whole. The break-even amount for EHPA and NRMR will vary by size and type of dwelling unit; similar variations as to other line items may be made if the LHA deems this equitable.

      (b)  When the homebuyer's required monthly payment (see § 904.107(j)) exceeds the applicable break-even amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income.

      (c)  When the homebuyer's required monthly payment is less than the applicable break-even amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the monthly payment designated for operating expense (i. e., as a reduction of Project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the break-even amount for these accounts.

      § 904.109   Monthly operating expense.

#### § § 904.109

      (a)  The term “monthly operating expense” means the monthly amount needed for the following purposes:

      (1)  Administrative salaries, travel, legal expenses, office supplies, postage, telephone and telegraph, etc.;

      (2)  LHA expenses in the achievement of social goals, including costs such as salaries, publications, payments to the HBA to assist its operation, contract and other costs;

      (3)  Those utilities (such as water), if any, to be furnished by the LHA as part of operating expense;

      (4)  For community building, grounds, and other common areas, if any. The amount required for routine maintenance of common property depends upon the type of common property included in the development and the extent of the LHA's responsibility for maintenance (see also § 904.109(c));

      (5)  The cost of supplemental protective services paid by the LHA for the protection of persons and property;

      (6)  Premiums for fire and other insurance, payments in lieu of taxes to the local taxing body, collection losses, payroll taxes, etc.;

      (7)  Extraordinary maintenance of equipment applicable to the community building and grounds, and unanticipated items for non-dwelling structures (see § 904.112).

      (b)  The monthly operating expense rate for each fiscal year shall be established on the basis of the LHA's HUD-approved operating budget for that fiscal year. The operating budget may be revised during the course of the fiscal year in accordance with HUD requirements. If it is subsequently determined that the actual operating expense for a fiscal year was more or less than the amount provided by the monthly operating expense established for that fiscal year, the rate of monthly operating expenses to be established for the next fiscal year may be adjusted to account for the difference (see § 904.112(b)). Such adjustment may result in a change in the required monthly payment, see § 904.107(j)(3).

      (c)  During the period the LHA is responsible for the maintenance of common property, the annual operating budget and the monthly operating expense rate shall include the amount required for routine maintenance of all common property in the development, even though a number of the homes may have been acquired by homebuyers. During such period, this amount shall be computed on the basis of the total number of homes in the development (i. e., the annual amount budgeted for routine maintenance of common property shall be divided by the number of homes in the development, resulting in the annual amount for each home; this figure shall in turn be divided by 12 to determine the monthly amount to be included in the monthly operating expense (and in the break-even amount) for routine maintenance of common property). After the home owners association assumes responsibility for maintenance of common property, the monthly operating expense (and break-even amount) shall include an amount equal to the monthly assessment by the homeowners association for the remaining homes owned by the LHA (see § 904.112(b) for nonroutine maintenance of common property).

      (d)  A statement showing the budgeted monthly amount allocated in the current operating budget to each operating expense category shall be provided to the HBA and copies shall be provided to homebuyers upon request.

      § 904.110   Earned Home Payments Account (EHPA)

#### § § 904.110

      (a)  The LHA shall establish and maintain a separate EHPA for each homebuyer. Since the homebuyer is responsible for maintaining the home, a portion of his required monthly payment equal to the LHA's estimate, approved by HUD, of the monthly cost for such routine maintenance, taking into consideration the relative type and size of the homebuyer's home, shall be set aside in his EHPA. In addition, this account shall be credited with

      (1) Any voluntary payments made pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, and

      (2) Any amount earned through the performance of maintenance as provided in paragraph (d) of this section and § 904.111(c).

      (b)  (1) If for any reason the homebuyer is unable or fails to perform any item of required maintenance as described in § 904.107(a), the LHA shall arrange to have the work done in accordance with the procedures established by the LHA and the HBA and the cost thereof shall be charged to the homebuyer's EHPA. Inspections of the home shall be made jointly by the LHA and the HBA.

      (2) To the extent NRMR expense is attributable to the negligence of the homebuyer as determined by the HBA and approved by the LHA (see § 904.111), the cost thereof shall be charged to the EHPA.

      (c)  The homebuyer may exercise his option to buy the home, by paying the applicable purchase price pursuant to § 904.113 or § 904.115, only after satisfying the following conditions precedent:

      (1) Within the first two years of his occupancy, he has achieved a balance in his EHPA equal to 20 times the amount of the monthly EHPA credit as initially determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) He has met, and is continuing to meet, the requirements of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;

      (3) He has rendered, and is continuing to render, satisfactory performance of his responsibilities to the HBA.

      (d)  Homebuyers may earn additional EHPA credits by providing in whole or in part any of the maintenance necessary to the common property of the development. When such maintenance is to be provided by the homebuyer, this may be done and credit earned therefor only pursuant to a prior written agreement between the homebuyer and the LHA (or the home owners association, depending on who has responsibility for maintenance of the property involved), covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the homebuyer is to receive. In such cases, the agreed amount shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and credited to the homebuyer's EHPA upon completion of the work.

      (e)  (1) When the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the LHA shall notify the HBA and shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD and in accordance with any recommendations made by the HBA. If the HBA wishes to participate in the investment program, it should submit periodically to the LHA a list of HUD-approved securities, bonds, or obligations which the association recommends for investment by the LHA of the funds in the EHPAs. Interest earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each homebuyer's EHPA in proportion to the amount in each such reserve account.

      (2) Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the LHA shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances; (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of all the homebuyers' EHPAs, and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of all the homebuyers' EHPAs. This statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.

      (f)  To enable the homebuyer to acquire title to his home within a shorter period, he may, either periodically or in a lump sum, voluntarily make payments over and above his required monthly payments. Such voluntary payments shall be deposited to his credit in his EHPA.

      (g)  Under exceptional circumstances as determined by the HBA and the LHA, a homebuyer's EHPA may be used to pay his delinquent required monthly payments, provided the amount used for this purpose does not seriously deplete the account and provided that the homebuyer agrees to cooperate in such counseling as may be made available by the LHA or the HBA.

      (h)  The LHA shall provide an annual statement to each homebuyer specifying at least (1) the amount in his EHPA, and (2) the amount in his NRMR. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the LHA which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the NRMR shall be accounted for through a work order. A homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his home.

      (i)  The homebuyer shall have no right to assign, withdraw, or in any way dispose of the funds in its EHPA except as provided in this section or in § 904.113 and § 904.115.

      (j)  (1) In the event a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement with the LHA is terminated or if the homebuyer vacates the home (see § 904.107 (m), (n) and (o)), the LHA shall charge against the homebuyer's EHPA the amounts required to pay

      (i) The amount due the LHA, including the monthly payments the homebuyer is obligated to pay up to the date he vacates;

      (ii) The monthly payment for the period the home is vacant, not to exceed 30 days from the date of notice of intention to vacate, or, if the homebuyer fails to give notice of intention to vacate, 30 days from the date the home is put in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with § 904.107; and

      (iii) The cost of any routine maintenance, and of any nonroutine maintenance attributable to the negligence of the homebuyer, required to put the home in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with § 904.107.

      (2) If the EHPA balance is not sufficient to cover all of these charges, the LHA shall require the homebuyer to pay the additional amount due. If the amount in the account exceeds these charges, the excess shall be paid to the homebuyer.

      (3) Settlement with the homebuyer shall be made promptly after the actual cost of repairs to the dwelling has been determined (see paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section), provided that the LHA shall make every effort to make such settlement within 30 days from the date the homebuyer vacates. The homebuyer may obtain a settlement within 7 days of the date he vacates, even though the actual cost of such repair has not yet been determined, if he has given the LHA notice of intention to vacate at least 30 days prior to the date he vacates and if the amount to be charged against his EHPA for such repairs is based on the LHA's estimate of the cost thereof (determined after consultation with the appropriate representative of the HBA).

      § 904.111   Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR).

#### § § 904.111

      (a)  The LHA shall establish and maintain a separate NRMR for each home, using a portion of the homebuyer's monthly payment. The purpose of the NRMR is to provide funds for the nonroutine maintenance of the home, which consists of the infrequent and costly items of maintenance and replacement shown on the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule for the home (see paragraph (b) of this section). Such maintenance may include the replacement of dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), replacement of roof, exterior painting, major repairs to heating and plumbing systems, etc. The NRMR shall not be used for nonroutine maintenance of common property, or for nonroutine maintenance relating to the home to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the Homebuyer's negligence or to defective materials or workmanship.

      (b)  The amount of the monthly payments to be set aside for NRMR shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule showing the amount likely to be needed for nonroutine maintenance of the home during the term of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, taking into consideration the type of construction and dwelling equipment. This Schedule shall (1) list each item of nonroutine maintenance (e.g., range, refrigerator, plumbing, heating system, roofing, tile flooring, exterior painting, etc.), (2) show for each listed item the estimated frequency of maintenance or useful life before replacement, the estimated cost of maintenance or replacement (including installation) for each occasion, and the annual reserve requirement, and (3) show the total reserve requirements for all the listed items, on an annual and a monthly basis. This Schedule shall be prepared by the LHA and approved by HUD as part of the submission required to determine the financial feasibility of the Project. The Schedule shall be revised after approval of the working drawings and specifications, and shall thereafter be reexamined annually in the light of changing economic conditions and experience.

      (c)  (1) The LHA shall provide the nonroutine maintenance necessary for the home and the cost thereof shall be funded as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such maintenance may be provided by the homebuyer but only pursuant to a prior written agreement with the LHA covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the homebuyer is to receive. The amount of any credit shall, upon completion of the work, be credited to the homebuyer's EHPA and charged as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (2) The cost of nonroutine maintenance shall be charged to the NRMR for the home except that (i) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the homebuyer's EHPA after consultation with the HBA if the hombuyer disagrees, and (ii) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, or even though covered by warranty if not paid for thereunder through no fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense account of the Project.

      (3) In the event the amount charged against the NRMR exceeds the balance therein, the difference (deficit) shall be made up from continuing monthly credits to the NRMR based upon the homebuyer's monthly payments. If there is still a deficit when the homebuyer acquires title, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit at settlement (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).

      (d)  (1) In the event the Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated, the homebuyer shall not receive any balance or be required to pay any deficit in the NRMR. When a subsequent homebuyer moves in, the NRMR shall continue to be applicable to the home in the same amount as if the preceding homebuyer had continued in occupancy.

      (2) In the event the homebuyer purchases the home, and there remains a balance in the NRMR, the LHA shall pay such balance to the homebuyer at settlement. In the event the homebuyer purchases and there is a deficit in the NRMR, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit to the LHA at settlement.

      (e)  (1) When the aggregate amount of the NRMR balances for all the homes exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days the LHA shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD. Income earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each homebuyer's NRMR in proportion to the amount in each reserve account.

      (2) Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the LHA shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all NRMR balances, (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of the NRMRs, and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of the NRMRs. A copy of this statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.

      § 904.112   Operating reserve.

#### § § 904.112

      (a)  To the extent that total operating receipts (including subsidies for operations) exceed total operating expenditures of the Project, the LHA shall establish an operating reserve up to the maximum approved by HUD in connection with its approval of the annual operating budgets for the Project. The purpose of this reserve is to provide funds for

      (1) The infrequent but costly items of nonroutine maintenance and replacements of common property, taking into consideration the types of items which constitute common property, such as nondwelling structures and equipment, and in certain cases, common elements of dwelling structures,

      (2) Nonroutine maintenance for the homes to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty,

      (3) Working capital for payment of a deficit in a homebuyer's NRMR, until such deficit is offset by future monthly payments by the homebuyer or at settlement in the event the homebuyer should purchase, and

      (4) A deficit in the operation of the Project for a fiscal year, including a deficit resulting from monthly payments totaling less than the break-even amount for the Project.

      (b)  The amount under this heading to be included in operating expense (and in the break-even amount) established for the fiscal year (see § 904.108 and § 904.109) shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of estimates of the monthly amount needed to accumulate an adequate reserve for the items described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This amount shall be subject to revision in the light of experience. This contribution to the operating reserve shall be made only during the period the LHA is responsible for the maintenance of any common property; and during such period, the amount shall be determined on the basis of the requirements of all common property in the development in a manner similar to that explained in § 904.109(c). When the operating reserve reaches the maximum authorized in paragraph (c) of this section, the break-even (monthly operating expense) computations (see §§ 904.108 and 904.109) for the next and succeeding fiscal years need not include a provision for this contribution to the operating reserve unless the balance of the reserve is reduced below the maximum during any such succeeding fiscal year.

      (c)  The maximum operating reserve that may be retained by the LHA at the end of any fiscal year shall be the sum of (1) one-half of total routine expense included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year and (2) one-third of total break-even amounts included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year; provided that such maximum may be increased if necessary as determined or approved by HUD. Total routine expense means the sum of the amounts budgeted for administration, homebuyers services, LHA-supplied utilities, routine maintenance of common property, protective services, and general expense or other category of day-to-day routine expense (see § 904.109 above for explanation of various categories of expense).

      (d)  The LHA shall be responsible for and shall retain custody of the operating reserve until the homeowners acquire voting control of the homeowners association (see §§ 904.118(c) and 904.119(f). When the homeowners acquire voting control, the homeowners association shall then assume full responsibility for management and maintenance of common property under a plan approved by HUD, and there shall be transferred to the homeowners association a portion of the operating reserve then held by the LHA. The amount of the reserve to be transferred shall be based upon the proportion that one-half of budgeted routine expense (used as a basis for determining the current maximum operating reserve—see paragraph (c) of this section) bears to the approved maximum operating reserve. Specifically, the portion of operating reserve to be transferred shall be computed as follows: Obtain a percentage by dividing one-half of budgeted routine expense by the approved maximum operating reserve; and multiply the actual operating reserve balance by this percentage.

      (e)  If, at the end of a fiscal year, there is an excess over the maximum operating reserve this excess shall be applied to the operating deficit of the Project, if any, and any remainder shall be paid to HUD. Following the end of the fiscal year in which the last home has been conveyed by the LHA, the balance of the operating reserve held by the LHA shall be paid to HUD, provided that the aggregate amount of payments by the LHA under this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by HUD with respect to the Project.

      § 904.113   Achievement of ownership by initial homebuyer.

#### § § 904.113

      (a)  The LHA shall determine the initial purchase price of the home by two basic steps, as follows:

      (b)  Each homebuyer shall be provided with a Purchase Price Schedule showing (1) the monthly declining purchase price over a 30-year period,   commencing with the initial purchase price on the first day of the month following the effective date of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement and (2) the monthly debt service amount upon which the Schedule is based. The Schedule and debt service amount shall be computed on the basis of the initial purchase price, a 30-year period,   and a rate of interest equal to the minimum loan interest rate as specified in the Annual Contributions Contract for the Project on the date of HUD approval of the Development Cost Budget, described in paragraph (a) of this section, rounded up, if necessary, to the next multiple of one-fourth of one percent (  percent).

      (c)  (1) The homebuyer may achieve ownership when the amount in his EHPA, plus such portion of the NRMR as he wishes to use for the purchase, is equal to the purchase price as shown at that time on his Purchase Price Schedule plus all Incidental Costs (Incidental Costs mean the costs incidental to acquiring ownership, including, but not limited to, the costs for a credit report, field survey, title examination, title insurance, and inspections, the fees for attorneys other than the LHA's attorney, mortgage application and organization, closing and recording, and the transfer taxes and loan discount payment, if any). If for any reason title to the home is not conveyed to the homebuyer during the month in which such circumstances occur, the purchase price shall be fixed at the amount specified for such month and the homebuyer shall be refunded (i) the net additions, if any, credited to his EHPA subsequent to such month, and (ii) such part of the monthly payments made by the homebuyer after the purchase price has been fixed which exceeds the sum of the break-even amount attributable to the unit and the interest portion of the debt service shown in the Purchase Price Schedule.

      (2) Where the sum of the purchase price and Incidental Costs is greater than the amounts in the homebuyer's EHPA and NRMR as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the homebuyer may achieve ownership by obtaining financing for or otherwise paying the excess amount. The purchase price shall be the amount shown on his Purchase Price Schedule for the month in which the settlement date for the purchase occurs.

      (d) The maximum period for achieving ownership shall be 30 years, but depending upon increases in the homebuyers income and the amount of credit which the homebuyer can accumulate through maintenance and voluntary payments, the period may be shortened accordingly.

      § 904.114   Payment upon resale at profit.

#### § § 904.114

      (a)  (1) When a homebuyer achieves ownership (regardless of whether ownership is achieved under § 904.113 or § 904.115), he shall sign a note obligating him to make a payment to the LHA, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) or this section, in the event he resells his home at a profit within 5 years of actual residence in the home after he becomes a homeowner. If, however, the homeowner should purchase and occupy another home within one year (18 months in case of a newly constructed home) of the resale of the Turnkey III home, the LHA shall refund to the homeowner the amount previously paid by him under the note, less the amount, if any, by which the resale price of the Turnkey III home exceeds the acquisition price of the new home, provided that application for such refund shall be made no later than 30 days after the date of acquisition of the new home.

      (2) The note to be signed by the homebuyer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be a non interest-bearing promissory note (see Appendix IV) to the LHA. The note shall be executed at the time the homebuyer becomes a homeowner and shall be secured by a second mortgage. The initial amount of the note shall be computed by taking the appraised value of the home at the time the homebuyer becomes a homeowner and subtracting (i) the homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs and (ii) the increase in value of the home, determined by appraisal, caused by improvements paid for by the homebuyer with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR. The note shall provide that this initial amount shall be automatically reduced by 20 percent thereof at the end of each year of residency as a homeowner, with the note terminating at the end of the five-year period of residency, as determined by the LHA. To protect the homeowner, the note shall provide that the amount payable under it shall in no event be more than the net profit on the resale, that is, the amount by which the resale price exceeds the sum of (A) the homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs, (B) the costs of the resale, including commissions and mortgage prepayment penalties, if any, and (C) the increase in value of the home, determined by appraisal, due to improvements paid for by him as a homebuyer (with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR) or as a homeowner.

      (3) Amounts collected by the LHA under such notes shall be retained by the LHA for use in making refunds pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. After expiration of the period for the filing of claims for such refunds, any remaining amounts shall be applied (i) to reduce the LHA's capital indebtedness on the Project and (ii) after such indebtedness has been paid, for such purposes as may be authorized or approved by HUD under such Annual Contributions Contract as the LHA may then have with HUD.

      (b)  The five-year note period does not end if the homeowner rents or otherwise does not use the home as his principal place of residence for any period within the first five years after he achieves ownership. Only the actual amount of time he is in residence is counted and the note shall be in effect until a total of five years time of residence has elapsed, at which time the homeowner may request the LHA to release him from the note, and the LHA shall do so.

      § 904.115   Achievement of ownership by subsequent homebuyers.

#### § § 904.115

      (a)  In the event the initial homebuyer and his family vacate the home before having acquired ownership, a subsequent occupant who enters into a Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement and who is not a successor pursuant to § 904.107(l)(2) is herein called a “subsequent homebuyer.”

      (b)  The initial purchase price for a subsequent homebuyer shall be an amount equal to (1) the purchase price shown in the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule as of the date of this Agreement with the subsequent homebuyer plus (2) the amount, if any, by which the appraised fair market value of the home, determined or approved by HUD as of the same date, exceeds the purchase price specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c)  The subsequent homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be the same as the unexpired portion of the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule except that where his purchase price includes an additional amount as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be followed by an Additional Purchase Price Schedule for such additional amount based upon the same monthly debt service and the same interest rate as applied to the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule.

      (d)  After payment in full of the LHA's debt, if there are any subsequent homebuyers who have not acquired ownership of their homes, the LHA shall continue to pay to HUD all residual receipts from the operation of the Project, including payments received on account of any Additional Purchase Price Schedules applicable to the homes, provided the aggregate amount of such payments of residual receipts does not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by HUD with respect to the Project.

      § 904.116   Transfer of title to homebuyer.

#### § § 904.116

      When the homebuyer is to obtain ownership as described in § 904.113 or § 904.115, a closing date shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. On the closing date the homebuyer shall pay the required amount of money to the LHA, sign the promissory note pursuant to § 904.114, and receive a deed for the home.

      § 904.117   Responsibilities of homebuyer after acquisition of ownership.

#### § § 904.117

      After acquisition of ownership, each homeowner shall be required to pay to the LHA or to the homeowners association, as appropriate, a monthly fee for (a) the maintenance and operation of community facilities including utility facilities, if any, (b) the maintenance of grounds and other common areas and, (c) such other purposes as determined by the LHA or the homeowners association, as appropriate, including taxes and a provision for a reserve. This requirement shall be set out in the planned unit development or condominium documents which shall be recorded prior to the date of full availability, or in an LHA-homeowner contract in this regard.

      § 904.118   Homeowners association—planned unit development (PUD).

#### § § 904.118

      If the development is organized as a planned unit development:

      (a)  The common areas, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common property in the development shall be owned and maintained as provided for in the approved planned unit development (PUD) program except that the LHA shall be responsible for maintenance until such time as the homeowners association assumes such responsibility (see § 904.112(d)).

      (b)  The title ultimately conveyed to each homebuyer shall be subject to restrictions and encumbrances to protect the rights and property of all other owners. The homeowners association shall have the right and obligation to enforce such restrictions and encumbrances and to assess owners for the costs incurred in connection with common areas and property and other responsibilities.

      (c)  There shall be as many votes in the association as there are homes in the development, and, at the outset, all the voting rights shall be held by the LHA. As each home is conveyed to the homebuyer, one vote shall automatically go to the homeowner so that, when all the homes have been conveyed, the LHA shall no longer have any interest in the homeowners association.

      (d)  The LHA shall not lose its majority voting interest in the association as soon as a majority of the homes have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time, or the LHA so desires. If permitted by state law, provision shall be made for each home owned by the LHA to carry three votes, while each home owned by a homeowner shall carry one vote. Under this weighted voting plan, the LHA shall continue to have voting control until 75 percent of the homes have been acquired by homeowners. However, at its discretion, the LHA may transfer voting control to the homeowners when at least 50 percent of the homes have been acquired by the homeowners.

      § 904.119   Homeowners association—condominium.

#### § § 904.119

      If the development is organized as a condominium:

      (a) The LHA at the outset shall own each condominium unit and its undivided interest in the common areas;

      (b) All the land, including that land under the housing units, shall be a part of the common areas;

      (c) The homeowners association shall own no property but shall maintain and operate the common areas for the individual owners of the condominium units except that the LHA shall be responsible for maintenance until such time as the homeowners association assumes such responsibility (see § 904.112(d));

      (d) The percentage of undivided interest attached to each condominium unit shall be based on the ratio of the value of the units to the value of all units and shall be fixed when the development is completed. This percentage shall determine the homeowner's liability for the maintenance of the common areas and facilities;

      (e) Each homeowner's vote in the homeowners association shall be identical with the percentage of undivided interest attached to his unit; and

      (f) The LHA shall not lose its majority voting interest in the association as soon as units representing 50 percent of the value of all units have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time or the LHA so desires. For voting purposes, until units representing 75 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by homeowners, the total undivided interest attributable to the homes owned by the LHA shall be multiplied by three, if such weighted voting plan is permitted by state law. Under this plan, the LHA shall continue to maintain voting control until 75 percent of the homes have been acquired by homeowners. However, at its discretion, the LHA may transfer voting control to the homeowners when units representing at least 50 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by the homeowners.

      § 904.120   Relationship of homeowners association to HBA.

#### § § 904.120

      The HBA and the LHA may make arrangements to permit homebuyers to participate in homeowners association matters which affect the homebuyers. Such arrangements may include rights to attend meetings and to participate in homeowners association deliberations and decisions.

      § 904.121   Use of appendices.

#### § § 904.121

      Use of the following Appendices is mandatory for Projects developed under this subpart:

      § 904.122   Statutory preferences.

#### § § 904.122

      In selecting applicants for assistance under this part, the LHA must give preference, in accordance with the authorized preference requirements described in 24 CFR 5.410 through 5.430. Notwithstanding those preferences, the LHA can limit homeownership admission to eligible homeownership candidates.

    Subpart C—Homeownership Counseling and Training

      § 904.201   Purpose.

#### § § 904.201

      The purpose of the counseling and training program shall be to assure that the homebuyers, individually and collectively through their homebuyers association (HBA), will be more capable of dealing with situations with which they may be confronted, making decisions related to these situations, and understanding and accepting the responsibility and consequences that accompany those decisions.

      § 904.202   Objectives.

#### § § 904.202

      The counseling and training program should seek to achieve the following objectives:

      (a) Enable the potential homebuyer to have a full understanding of the responsibilities that accompany his participation in the Homeownership Opportunity Program;

      (b) Enable the potential homebuyer to have an understanding of homeownership tasks with specific training given to individuals as the need and readiness for counseling or training indicates;

      (c) Assure that the role of the HBA is understood and plans for its organization are initiated at the earliest practical time;

      (d) Develop an understanding of the role of the LHA and of the need for a cooperative relationship between the homebuyer and the LHA;

      (e) Encourage the development of self-help by the homebuyer through reducing dependency and increasing independent action;

      (f) Develop an understanding of mutual assistance and cooperation that will develop a feeling of self-respect, pride and community responsibility;

      (g) Develop local resources that can be of assistance to the individual and the community on an on-going basis.

      § 904.203   Planning.

#### § § 904.203

      (a) The counseling and training program shall be flexible and responsive to the needs of each prospective homebuyer. While many subjects lend themselves to group sessions, consideration shall be given to individual counseling. Individuals should not be required to attend training classes on subject matter they are familiar with unless they can actively participate in the instruction process.

      (b) The program may be provided by contract with an outside organization, or by the LHA staff, in either case with voluntary involvement and assistance of groups and individuals within the community. It is essential that the training entity be completely knowledgeable and supportive of the entire Homeownership Opportunity Program. It may be recognized that most of the objectives stated require specialized instructional skill and content knowledge. There shall be recognition of the differences in communication and in value systems, and an understanding and respect for past experience of the individual. Maximum possible use shall be made of indigenous trainers to insure good communication and rapport. Special attention shall be directed to the needs of working members of the family for counseling and training sessions to be held where and during the time they can attend. Where the services of outside contractors are utilized, there shall be a close working relationship with the LHA and a program for phasing in LHA staff who will have the on-going responsibility for the program. The value of local agencies, educational institutions, etc., for implementing the program rather than an outside firm shall be carefully considered since the continuing presence of such agencies and institutions in the community can often develop into an on-going resource beyond the contract period.

      (c) In planning a homeownership counseling and training program, whether self-administered or contracted, the LHA shall consult with HUD for advice and information on programs, qualified contractors, local resources, reasonable costs, and other similar matters.

      (d) Where the program is to be contracted to an outside group, proposals shall be secured either by public advertising or by sending requests for proposals to a number of competent public or private organizations.

      (e) In areas where there are large concentrations of homebuyers who do not read, write, or understand English fluently, the native language of the people shall be used. If feasible all instructional materials shall be in both languages.

      § 904.204   General requirements and information.

#### § § 904.204

      (a) The counseling and training program shall be designed to meet the needs of the homebuyers and be sufficiently flexible to meet new needs as they arise. The nature of the program suggests four phases of counseling: (1) Pre-occupancy; (2) move-in; (3) post-occupancy; (4) assistance to the HBA. While some elements of the program lend themselves more to one phase than another, the program areas shall be coordinated and interrelated. It is recommended that the entity providing these services work closely with the participants and ensure that policies established are agreeable to both the LHA and the homebuyer.

      (b) The following is a description of major elements of the program which experience thus far has shown to be relevant. More detailed information is set forth in Appendix I, “Content Guide for Counseling and Training Program.”

      (1)  The purpose of this phase is to prepare the selected families to assume the responsibilities of homeownership, and to provide an opportunity for the LHA and each family to reassess the family's potential for successful participation in the homeownership development.

      (i) An overload of information should be avoided in this phase since many of the subjects will be dealt with in greater depth after the family is in occupancy, and experience has shown that much of the information will be more relevant at that time.

      (ii) This phase should be completed for each family before the beginning of its occupancy.

      (2)  During this phase, the counseling and training staff should be available to the homebuyers on an individual basis. Services may include (i) inspecting the units, interior and exterior, with the homebuyers and a representative of the LHA, (ii) testing appliances and equipment, (iii) providing information on the moving process (packing, trucks, etc.), and (iv) assisting homebuyers in making adjustments occasioned by the move, serving as liaison among homebuyers, LHA, builder and other agencies, and assisting homebuyers in meeting new neighbors.

      (3)  Before this phase begins, a period (possibly one month) should elapse to allow homebuyers an opportunity to adjust to their new surroundings. This is a time when new questions and problems come to light that can be dealt with in further counseling and training. This phase should be designed to cover many of the same basic subjects as the pre-occupancy phase, both by review and refresher where necessary but in much greater depth.

      (4)  The parties responsible for the counseling and training program shall be responsible for the formation, incorporation, and development of the HBA, including the execution of the Recognition Agreement between the LHA and HBA, as provided in subpart D of this part.

      § 904.205   Training methodology.

#### § § 904.205

      Equal in importance to the content of the pre- and post-occupancy training is the training methodology. Because groups vary, there should be adaptability in the communication and learning experience. Methods to be utilized may include group presentations, small discussion groups, special classes, and workshops. Especially important to a successful program are individual family home visits for discussion and instruction on unique problems and operation of equipment.

      § 904.206   Funding.

#### § § 904.206

      (a)  For purpose of funding counseling and training pursuant to this subpart and for establishing the HBA, the LHA shall include an amount equal to $500 per dwelling unit in the development cost budget. If additional funds should be needed for any of these purposes, the LHA with the assistance of the CPC, if any, shall explore all other possible sources of services and funds.

      (b)  These funds are to be used to pay for:

      (1) Pre- and post-occupancy counseling and training;

      (2) Establishment and initial operation of the HBA (for operation in the management phase, see § 904.305).

      (c)  These funds shall be available during the development phase, and a specific amount shall be set aside, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, to be used for ongoing needs after the close of the development period.

      (d)  (1) The Development Cost Budget submitted with the Development Program shall include an estimated amount for counseling and training program costs. However, such costs shall not be incurred until after HUD approval of the counseling and training program.

      (2) Upon HUD approval of the counseling and training program, the LHA shall include the approved amount in its Contract Award Development Cost Budget. This amount shall constitute the maximum amount that may be included for such purposes in the project development cost; provided that, if the approved amount is less than $500 per dwelling unit, it may, if necessary, be amended with HUD approval, but not later than the Final Development Cost Budget and subject to the $500-per-unit limitation.

      (e)  (1) The LHA shall submit an application for approval of a counseling and training program and for approval of funds therefor. This application shall be submitted to HUD at the time of the submission of the development program or as soon thereafter as possible but no later than the submission of the working drawings and specifications.

      (2) The application shall include a narrative statement outlining the counseling and training program, including any services and funds to be obtained from other sources, together with copies of any proposed contract and other pertinent documents. This statement shall include the following:

      (i) Indication that the training entity is completely knowledgeable of the Homeownership Opportunity Program and is aware of the needs and problems of prospective homebuyers;

      (ii) The method and/or instruments to be used to determine individual training and counseling needs;

      (iii) The scope of the proposed program, including a detailed breakdown of tasks to be performed, products to be produced, and a time schedule, including provision for progress payments for specific tasks;

      (iv) An outline of the proposed content of the counseling and training to be provided, and the local community resources to be utilized;

      (v) The methods of counseling and training to be utilized;

      (vi) The experience and qualifications of the organization and of personnel who will directly provide the counseling and training;

      (vii) The estimated cost, source of funds, and methods of payment for the tasks and products to be performed or produced, including estimates of costs for each of the following categories:

      () Counseling _a_nd training during development phase:

      () Esta_b_lishment and initial operation of HBA

      () Counseling and training during management phase

      § 904.207   Use of appendix.

#### § § 904.207

      A Content Guide for Counseling and Training Program (Appendix I) is provided as further detailed information for consideration in designing the counseling and training program. The items set forth therein are not to be considered mandatory.

    Subpart D—Homebuyers Association (HBA)

      § 904.301   Purpose.

#### § § 904.301

      (a) It is essential that the homebuyers have an organized vehicle for pursuing their common interests, for effectively representing the needs of residents in dealing with the LHA, and for undertaking eventual management responsibility for the development. Although this organization, called the homebuyers association (HBA), shall be representative of the homebuyers and independent of the LHA, it shall be the responsibility of the LHA and the training and counseling staff to assist the homebuyers in their initial efforts at organization.

      (b) Except as noted in § 904.307, each Turnkey III development shall have an HBA. There shall be a separate HBA for each development or developments where there is a physical and financial community of interest.

      § 904.302   Membership.

#### § § 904.302

      Every family entitled to occupancy pursuant to a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement and every family which is a homeowner shall automatically be a member of the HBA.

      § 904.303   Organizing the HBA.

#### § § 904.303

      (a) The HBA should be organized and incorporated as early in the life of the development as is feasible, in order to allow selected homebuyers an opportunity to meet each other and begin forging a sense of community, but in any case the HBA shall be organized and incorporated no later than the date on which 50 percent of the homebuyers have been selected. Interim officers and directors shall be designated as part of the initial organization of the HBA to serve until full-term officers and directors are elected. Such full-term officers and directors shall be elected when 60 percent of the homebuyers are in occupancy, but, in any event, not later than one year from the date the first home is occupied.

      (b) The LHA, in cooperation with the CPC, if any, shall be responsible for assuring that competent counseling and training assistance pursuant to Subpart C of this part will be provided in organizing the HBA. These services shall be continued until the HBA is fully operational.

      (c) The provision of such services shall include at least the following functions:

      (1) Assembling homebuyers for initial orientation and planning;

      (2) Explaining to homebuyers the structure and functions of an HBA and the rights and responsibilities of the HBA and the LHA;

      (3) Aiding in the preparation of charters, by-laws, contracts with the LHA and other appropriate documents;

      (4) Assisting in the formation of the organization, including such things as the initial designation of interim officers and directors and subsequent election of full-term HBA officers and directors, and the establishment of necessary committees, if any.

      (d) The LHA and the HBA shall execute an agreement recognizing the HBA as the official representative of the homebuyers, and establishing the functions, rights, and responsibilities of both parties (see Appendix II). This agreement shall be executed as soon as possible after incorporation of the HBA.

      § 904.304   Functions of the HBA.

#### § § 904.304

      (a) Subject to possible variations agreed to by the HBA and approved by HUD, the functions of the HBA shall include the following:

      (1) Representing its members, individually and collectively, with respect to any deficiencies in the development or in the homes and with respect to fulfillment of the construction contract and related warranties;

      (2) Representing its members, individually and collectively, in their relationships with the LHA and others in regard to financial matters such as monthly payments, credits to and charges against reserves, settlement upon vacating the home, acquisition of ownership, and other matters pertaining to operation and management of the development;

      (3) Recommending policies and rules to the LHA for operation and management including rules concerning use of the common areas and community facilities;

      (4) Participating in the operation of official grievance mechanisms;

      (5) Advising and assisting its members regarding procedures and practices relative to the Earned Home Payments Account and the acquisition of homeownership;

      (6) Participating with the LHA in periodic maintenance inspections of homes after occupancy, and making recommendations in case of disagreements arising out of maintenance inspections;

      (7) Participating with the LHA in the selection of subsequent homebuyers;

      (8) Coordinating, supervising, or managing the operation of credit union, child care, or other supportive services established for the development;

      (9) Participating with the LHA in the establishment and implementation of policies related to collection of monthly payments, termination of occupancy, and resolution of hardship situations; and

      (10) Performing management services as specified under contract with the Authority or with the Homeowners Association and participating in other activities pursuant to agreement with the LHA or with the Homeowners Association.

      (b) In addition, the HBA may offer such special services as the following:

      (1) The development of self-help such as consumer clubs, furniture and other co-ops, credit unions, transportation pools, and skill pools;

      (2) Assisting homebuyers in acquiring group insurance;

      (3) Developing programs and contracting for services such as child care centers to be located in the community facility where such a facility exists;

      (4) Assisting homebuyers in their employment, especially by participating in skill development and apprenticeship programs in cooperation with local educational organizations;

      (5) Assisting homebuyers in planning the management role of the HBA and in negotiating any contract for management services with the LHA.

      § 904.305   Funding of HBA.

#### § § 904.305

      (a) In addition to providing the HBA with noncash contributions such as office space and duplicating services, the LHA shall make cash contributions for operating expenses of the HBA, in the amount provided for in paragraph (b) of this section. Until the project goes into management, these contributions shall be made from the development funds budgeted for the counseling and training program (see § 904.206). Thereafter, these contributions shall be provided for in the annual operating budgets of the LHA.

      (b) The cash contributions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be in the amount provided for in the LHA budget (development cost budget or annual operating budget, as the case may be) and approved by HUD. Such contributions shall be subject to whatever restrictions are applied by HUD to the funding of tenant councils generally, but they shall not exceed $3 per year per dwelling unit; provided that as an incentive to the HBA to provide additional funds from other sources such as homebuyer's dues, contributions, revenues from special projects or activities, etc., the LHA shall, to the extent approved by HUD in the LHA budget, match such additional funds beyond the $3 up to a maximum of $4.50, for a total LHA share of $7.50 where the total funding for the HBA is $12 or more. The HBA shall not be precluded from seeking to achieve total funding in excess of $12 per unit where this can be done with additional funds from sources other than the LHA. Furthermore, funding by the LHA for the normal expenses of the HBA is not to be confused with fees paid pursuant to management services contracts as described in § 904.306.

      § 904.306   Performing management services.

#### § § 904.306

      The LHA may also contract with the HBA to perform some or all of the functions of project management for which the HBA may be better suited or located than the LHA. Such functions may include security, maintenance of common property, or collection of monthly payments. For this purpose, the HBA may form a management corporation and the officers of the HBA shall be the directors of such corporation. This corporation and the LHA shall then negotiate a management services contract. Such arrangements are consistent with the objective of providing for maximum participation by residents in the management of their developments. As an alternative, the HBA and the LHA may elect to undertake any other arrangement approved by HUD.

      § 904.307   Alternative to HBA.

#### § § 904.307

      Where the homes are on scattered sites (noncontiguous lots throughout a multi-block area, with no common property), or where the number of homes may be too few to support an HBA, and where an alternative method for homebuyer representation and continuing counseling is provided, an HBA shall not be required. For such cases, a modified form of homebuyers association may be called for or a less formal organization may be desirable. This decision shall be made jointly by the LHA and the homebuyers, acting on the recommendation of HUD.

      § 904.308   Relationship with homeowners association.

#### § § 904.308

      The HBA and the homeowners association are, in legal terms, separate and distinct organizations with different functions. The homeowners association may hold title to and be responsible for maintenance of common property (see §§ 904.119 and 904.120), while the HBA has more general service and representative functions. While all residents are members of the HBA, only those who have acquired title to their homes are members of the homeowners association.

    Subpart A—General

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 63770, Oct. 24, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.100   Purpose, general description, and other requirements.

#### § § 905.100

      (a)  The Public Housing Capital Fund Program (Capital Fund Program or CFP) provides financial assistance to public housing agencies (PHAs) and resident management corporations (RMC) (pursuant to 24 CFR 964.225) to make improvements to existing public housing. The CFP also provides financial assistance to develop public housing, including mixed-finance developments that contain public housing units.

      (b)  Congress appropriates amounts for the Capital Fund in HUD's annual appropriations. In order to receive a Capital Fund grant, the PHA must:

      (1) Validate project-level information in HUD's data systems, as prescribed by HUD;

      (2) Have an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan;

      (3) Enter into a Capital Fund Annual Contributions Contract (CF ACC) Amendment to the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract (as defined in 24 CFR 5.403) with HUD; and

      (4) Provide a written certification and counsel's opinion that all property receiving Capital Fund assistance is under a currently effective Declaration of Trust (DOT) and is in compliance with the CF ACC and the Act.

      (c)  Section 905.300 of this part describes the information to be submitted to HUD for the CFP. HUD uses the CF formula set forth in § 905.400 of this part, along with data provided by the PHA and other information, including, but not limited to, the high-performance information from the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) and location cost indices, to determine each PHA's annual grant amount. HUD notifies each PHA of the amount of the grant and provides a CF ACC Amendment that must be signed by the PHA and executed by HUD in order for the PHA to access the grant. After HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment, the PHA may draw down funds for eligible costs that have been described in its CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report or CFP 5-Year Action Plan.

      (d)  Eligible Capital Fund costs and activities as further described in subpart B of this part include, but are not limited to, making physical improvements to the public housing stock and developing public housing units to be added to the existing inventory. With HUD approval, a PHA may also leverage its public housing inventory by borrowing additional capital on the private market and pledging a portion of its annual Capital Funds for debt service, in accordance with § 905.500 of this part.

      (e)  A PHA must obligate and expend its Capital Funds in accordance with § 905.306 of this part. The PHA will directly employ labor, either temporarily or permanently, to perform work (force account) or contract for the required work in accordance with 2 CFR part 200”. Upon completion of the work, the PHA must submit an Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) and a final Performance and Evaluation Report (in accordance with § 905.322 of this part) to HUD to close out each Capital Fund grant.

      (f)  Section 905.500 of this part regulates financing activities using Capital Funds and Operating Funds. Section 905.600 of this part contains the development requirements, including those related to mixed-finance development, formerly found in 24 CFR part 941. Section 905.700 of this part describes the criteria for the use of Capital Funds for other security interests. Section 905.800 of this part addresses PHA compliance with Capital Fund requirements and HUD capability for review and sanction for noncompliance.

      (g)  Public housing agencies must apply the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, to mixed finance developments covered under § 905.604.

#### § § 905.104

      All HUD approvals required in this part must be in writing and from an official designated to grant such approval.

      § 905.106   Compliance.

#### § § 905.106

      PHAs or owner/management entities or their partners are required to comply with all applicable provisions of this part. Execution of the CF ACC Amendment, submissions required by this part, and disbursement of Capital Fund grants from HUD are individually and collectively deemed to be the PHA's certification that it is in compliance with the provisions of this part and all other Public Housing Program Requirements. Noncompliance with any provision of this part or other applicable requirements may subject the PHA and/or its partners to sanctions contained in § 905.804 of this part.

      § 905.108   Definitions.

      (b) Activities and costs not included in the PHA's CFP 5-Year Action Plan, with the exception that expenditures for emergencies and disasters, as defined in § 905.204 of this subpart, that are not identified in the 5-year Action Plan because of their emergent nature are eligible costs;

      (c) Improvements or purchases that are not modest in design and cost because they include amenities, materials, and design in excess of what is customary for the locality. Air conditioning is an eligible modest amenity;

      (d) Any costs not authorized as outlined in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, including, but not limited to, indirect administrative costs and indemnification;

      (h) Ineligible management improvements include:

      (1) Costs for security guards or ongoing security services (Capital Funds may only be used for the initial capital (e.g., fencing, lights, and cameras) or noncapital (e.g., training of in-house security staff) management improvements but may not be used for the ongoing costs, such as security guards after the end of the implementation period of the physical improvements);

      (2) General remedial education; and

      (3) Job counseling, job development and placement, supportive services during training, and the hiring of a resident coordinator. No continued Capital Funds will be provided after the end of the implementation period of the management improvements.

      § 905.204   Emergencies and natural disasters.

#### § § 905.204

      (a)  PHAs are required by the CF ACC to carry various types of insurance to protect it from loss. In most cases, insurance coverage will be the primary source of funding to pay repair or replacement costs associated with emergencies and natural disasters. Where the Department's Annual Appropriations Act establishes a set-aside from the Capital Fund appropriation for emergencies and natural disasters, the procedures in this section apply.

      (b)  An emergency is an unforeseen or unpreventable event or occurrence that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of the residents that must be corrected within one year of funding. A natural disaster for purposes of the Capital Fund reserve, is a non-presidentially declared disaster. In the event an emergency or natural disaster arises, HUD may require a PHA to use any other source that may legally be available, including unobligated Capital Funds, prior to providing emergency or natural disaster funds from the set-aside. The Department will review, on a case-by-case basis, requests for emergency and natural disaster funding from PHAs.

      (c)  To obtain emergency or natural disaster funds, a PHA shall submit a written request in the form and manner prescribed by HUD. In a natural disaster where the PHA requires immediate relief to preserve the property and safety of the residents, the PHA may submit a preliminary request outlined in paragraph (d) of this section. Subsequently, the PHA is required to complete and submit the remaining information outlined in paragraph (e) of this section, at a time prescribed by HUD. For emergency requests, PHAs are to follow the procedures outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (d)  A PHA may request a preliminary grant only for costs necessary for immediate preservation of the property and safety of the residents. The application should include the reasonable identification of damage and preservation costs as determined by the PHA. An independent assessment will be required when the PHA submits the final request or when the PHA reconciles the preliminary application grant with the actual amounts received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance carriers, and other natural disaster relief sources. Regardless of whether further funding from the set-aside is requested, at a time specified by HUD, the PHA will be expected to provide a reconciliation of all funds received, to ensure that the PHA does not receive duplicate funding.

      (e)  In the request the PHA shall:

      (1) Identify the public housing project(s) with the emergency or natural disaster condition(s).

      (2) Identify and provide the date of the conditions that present an unforeseen or unpreventable threat to the health, life, or safety of residents, in the case of emergency; or Natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, tornado, etc.).

      (3) Describe the activities that will be undertaken to correct the emergency or the conditions caused by the natural disaster and the estimated cost.

      (4) Provide an independent assessment of the extent of and the cost to correct the condition. The assessment must be specific as to the damage and costs associated with the emergency or natural disaster. An independent estimate of damage and repair cost is required as a part of the final natural disaster application. For natural disasters, the assessment must identify damage specifically caused by the natural disaster. The set-aside can be used only to pay costs to repair or replace a public housing project damaged as a result of the natural disaster, not for nonroutine maintenance or other improvements.

      (5) Provide a copy of a currently effective DOT covering the property and an opinion of counsel that there are no preexisting liens or other encumbrances on the property.

      (6) Demonstrate that without the requested funds from the set-aside, the PHA does not have adequate funds available to correct the emergency condition(s).

      (7) Identify all other sources of available funds (e.g., insurance proceeds, FEMA).

      (8) Any other material required by HUD.

      (f)  HUD shall review all requests for emergency or natural disaster funds. If HUD determines that a PHA's request meets the requirements of this section, HUD shall approve the request subject to the availability of funds in the set-aside, in the order in which requests are received and are determined approvable.

      (g)  Upon being provided with a CF ACC Amendment from HUD, the PHA must sign and date the CF ACC Amendment and return it to HUD by the date established by HUD. HUD will execute the signed and dated CF ACC Amendment submitted by the PHA.

    Subpart C—General Program Requirements

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 63773, Oct. 24, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.300   Capital fund submission requirements.

#### § § 905.300

      (a)  Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in this section apply to both qualified PHAs (as described in § 903.3(c) of this chapter) and nonqualified PHAs. Each PHA must complete a comprehensive physical needs assessment (PNA).

      (1)  Small PHAs (PHAs that own or operate fewer than 250 public housing units) must comply with the requirements of this section beginning 30 days after the end of the federal fiscal year quarter following HUD's publication of a notice in the

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b)  At the time that the PHA submits the ACC Amendment(s) for its Capital Fund Grants(s) to HUD, the PHA must also submit the following items:

      (1)  (i)  The CFP 5-Year Action Plan must describe the capital improvements necessary to ensure long-term physical and social viability of the PHA's public housing developments, including the capital improvements to be undertaken within the 5-year period, their estimated costs, status of environmental review, and any other information required for participation in the CFP, as prescribed by HUD. In order to be entitled to fungibility, PHA's must have an approved 5-year Action Plan. Except in the case of emergency/disaster work, the PHA shall not spend Capital Funds on any work that is not included in an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan and its amendments.

      (ii)  The Capital Fund Budget for each of the 5 years shall be prepared by a PHA using the form(s) prescribed by HUD. Work items listed in the budget must include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (A) Where a PHA has an approved Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP) loan, debt service payments for the grants from which the payments are scheduled;

      (B) Where a PHA has an approved CFFP loan, the PHA shall also include all work and costs, including debt service payments, in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan. Work associated with the use of financing proceeds will be reported separately in a form and manner prescribed by HUD; or

      (C) Work affecting health and safety and compliance with regulatory requirements such as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, and the lead-based paint poisoning prevention standards at 24 CFR part 35, before major systems (e.g., heating, roof, etc.) and other costs of lower priority.

      (iii) PHA Criteria for Significant Amendment or Modification. The PHA must include in the basic criteria that the PHA will use for determining a significant amendment or modification to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In addition to the criteria established by the PHA, for the purpose of the CFP, a proposed demolition, disposition, homeownership, Capital Fund financing, development, or mixed-finance proposal are considered significant amendments to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan.

      (iv)  The PHA must submit a Board-approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan at least once every 5 years. The PHA may choose to update its CFP 5-Year Action Plan every year. The PHA shall indicate whether its CFP 5-Year Action Plan is fixed or rolling. Prior to submission to HUD, the 5-Year Action Plan must have been approved by the PHA's Board of Commissioners. In any given year that a PHA does not have a CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, the Capital Fund grant(s) for these PHAs will be reserved and obligated; however, the PHA will not have access to those funds until its CFP 5-Year Action Plan is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD.

      (v) Significant amendments or modification to the CFP 5 Year Action Plan. PHAs making significant amendments or modifications to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, must follow the requirements of this section.

      (A) A PHA after submitting its 5-Year Action Plan may amend or modify the plan. If the amendment or modification is a significant amendment or modification, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the PHA:

      (1) May not adopt the amendment or modification until the PHA has duly called a meeting of its Board of Commissioners (or similar governing body) and the meeting at which the amendment or modification is adopted, is open to the public; and

      (2) May not implement the amendment or modification until notification of the amendment or modifications are provided to HUD and approved by HUD in accordance with HUD's plan review procedures, as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

      (B) Each significant amendment or modification to a plan submitted to HUD is subject to the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (2)  The PHA is also required to submit various certifications to HUD, in a form prescribed by HUD, including, but not limited to:

      (i) Certification of PIC Data;

      (ii) Standard Form—Disclosure of Lobbying Activities;

      (iii) Civil Rights Compliance, in a form prescribed by HUD; and

      (iv) Certification of Compliance with Public Hearing Requirements.

      (3)  A PHA must annually conduct a public hearing and consult with the Resident Advisory Board (RAB) of the PHA to discuss the Capital Fund submission. The PHA may elect to conduct a separate annual public hearing in order to solicit public comments or to hold the annual public hearing at the same time as the hearing for the Annual PHA Plan, the 5-Year Plan, or the required annual hearing for qualified public housing authorities. The hearing must be conducted at a location that is convenient to the residents served by the PHA.

      (i) Not later than 45 days before the public hearing is to take place, the PHA must:

      (A) Make the Capital Fund submission along with the material required under this paragraph (b) available to the residents and the RAB; and

      (B) Publish a notice informing the public that the information is available for review and inspection; that a public hearing will take place on the plan; and of the date, time, and location of the hearing.

      (C) PHAs shall conduct reasonable outreach activities to encourage broad public participation in the review of the Capital Fund submission.

      (4)  The PHA must consider the comments from the residents, the public, and the RAB on the Capital Fund submission, or any significant modification thereto. In submitting the final CFP 5-Year Action Plan to HUD for approval, or any significant amendment or modification to the 5-Year Action Plan to HUD for approval, the PHA must include a copy of the recommendations made by the RAB(s) and a description of the manner in which the PHA addressed these recommendations.

      (5)  The Capital Fund submission must be consistent with any applicable Consolidated Plan.

      (6)  The CFP submission requirements must meet the requirements of this part as well as the Public Housing Program Requirements as defined in § 905.108 of this part. A PHA is required to revise or correct information that is not in compliance, and HUD has the authority to impose administrative sanctions until the appropriate revisions are made. HUD will review the CFP submission requirements to determine whether:

      (i) All of the information that is required to be submitted is included;

      (ii) The information is consistent with the needs identified in the PNA and data available to HUD; and

      (iii) There are any issues of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, or contract requirements that have not been addressed with the proposed use of the Capital Fund.

      (7)  The requirements identified in this paragraph (b) must be submitted to HUD, in a format prescribed by HUD, at the time that the PHA submits its signed CF ACC Amendment.

      (8)  (i) All PHAs must prepare a CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report at a time and in a format prescribed by HUD. These reports shall be retained on file for all grants for which a final Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or an Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) has not been submitted. A final Performance and Evaluation Report must be submitted in accordance with 24 CFR 905.322, at the time the PHA submits its AMCC or ADCC.

      (ii) PHAs that are designated as troubled performers under PHAS (24 CFR part 902) or as troubled under the Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) (24 CFR part 985), and/or were identified as noncompliant with section 9(j) obligation and expenditure requirements during the fiscal year, shall submit their CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Reports to HUD for review and approval.

      (iii) All other PHAs, that are not designated as troubled performers under PHAS and are not designated as troubled under SEMAP, and that were in compliance with section 9(j) obligation and expenditure requirements during the fiscal year, shall prepare a CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation report for all open grants and shall retain the report(s) on file at the PHA, to be available to HUD upon request.

      (9)  MTW PHAs are to submit the Capital Fund submissions as part of the MTW Plan annually, as required by the MTW Agreement.

      (c)-(d) [Reserved]

      § 905.302   Timely submission of the CF ACC amendment by the PHA.

#### § § 905.302

      Upon being provided with a CF ACC Amendment from HUD, the PHA must sign and date the CF ACC Amendment and return it to HUD by the date established. HUD will execute the signed and dated CF ACC Amendment submitted by the PHA. If HUD does not receive the signed and dated Amendment by the submission deadline, the PHA will receive the Capital Fund grant for that year; however, it will have less than 24 months to obligate 90 percent of the Capital Fund grant and less than 48 months to expend these funds because the PHA's obligation start date and disbursement end date for these grants will remain as previously established by HUD.

      § 905.304   CF ACC term and covenant to operate.

#### § § 905.304

      (a)  The PHA shall operate all public housing projects in accordance with the CF ACC, as amended, and applicable HUD regulations, for the statutorily prescribed period. These periods shall be evidenced by a recorded DOT on all public housing property. If the PHA uses Capital Funds to develop public housing or to modernize existing public housing, the CF ACC term and the covenant to operate those projects are as follows:

      (1)  Each public housing project developed using Capital Funds shall establish a restricted use covenant, either in the DOT or as a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, to operate under the terms and conditions applicable to public housing for a 40-year period that begins on the date on which the project becomes available for occupancy, as determined by HUD.

      (2)  For PHAs that receive Capital Fund assistance, the execution of each new CF ACC Amendment establishes an additional 20-year period that begins on the latest date on which modernization is completed, except that the additional 20-year period does not apply to a project that receives Capital Fund assistance only for management improvements.

      (3)  Any public housing project developed that receives Operating Fund assistance shall have a covenant to operate under requirements applicable to public housing for a 10-year period beginning upon the conclusion of the fiscal year for which such amounts were provided, except for such shorter period as permitted by HUD by an exception.

      (b)  The PHA shall not allow  or security interest in public housing assets, including under section 30 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-2), without prior written approval from HUD. PHAs that undertake financing unsecured by public housing assets shall include the following nonrecourse language in all financing documents as follows:

      (c)  All public housing subject to this part or required by law shall be maintained and operated as public housing, as prescribed, until the latest expiration date provided in section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3)) or any other provision of law or regulation mandating the operation of the housing as public housing, or under terms and conditions applicable to public housing, for a specified period of time.

      § 905.306   Obligation and expenditure of Capital Fund grants.

#### § § 905.306

      (a)  A PHA shall obligate each Capital Fund grant, including formula grants, Replacement Housing Factor (RHF) grants, Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding (DDTF) grants, and natural disaster grants, no later than 24 months after, and emergency grants no later than 12 months after, the date on which the funds become available to the PHA for obligation, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, a PHA with unobligated funds from a grant shall disregard this requirement for up to not more than 10 percent of the originally allocated funds from that grant. The funds become available to the PHA when HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment. With HUD approval, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the PHA can accumulate RHF grants for up to 5 years or until it has adequate funds to undertake replacement housing. The PHA shall obligate 90 percent of the RHF grant within 24 months from the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (b)  For funds to be considered obligated, all items and costs must meet the definition of “obligation” in § 905.108 of this part.

      (c)  The PHA may request an extension of the obligation deadline, and HUD may grant an extension for a period of up to 12 months, based on:

      (1) The size of the PHA;

      (2) The complexity of the CFP of the PHA;

      (3) Any limitation on the ability of the PHA to obligate the amounts allocated for the PHA from the Capital Fund in a timely manner as a result of state or local law; or

      (4) Any other factors that HUD determines to be relevant.

      (d)  HUD may extend the obligation deadline for a PHA for such a period as HUD determines to be necessary, if HUD determines that the failure of the PHA to obligate assistance in a timely manner is attributable to:

      (1) Litigation;

      (2) Delay in obtaining approvals from the Federal Government or a state or local government that is not the fault of the PHA;

      (3) Compliance with environmental assessment and abatement requirements;

      (4) Relocating residents;

      (5) An event beyond the control of the PHA; or

      (6) Any other reason established by HUD by notice in the

      (e)  (1) For any month during the fiscal year, HUD shall withhold all new Capital Fund grants from any PHA that has unobligated funds in violation of paragraph (a) of this section. The penalty will be imposed once the violations of paragraph (a) are known. The PHA may cure the noncompliance by:

      (i) Requesting in writing that HUD recapture the unobligated balance of the grant; or

      (ii) Continuing to obligate funds for the grant in noncompliance until the noncompliance is cured.

      (2) After the PHA has cured the noncompliance, HUD will release the withheld Capital Fund grant(s) minus a penalty of one-twelfth of the grant for each month of noncompliance.

      (f)  The PHA shall expend all grant funds within 48 months after the date on which funds become available, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. The deadline to expend funds may be extended only by the period of time of a HUD-approved extension of the obligation deadline. No other extensions of the expenditure deadline will be granted. All funds not expended will be recaptured.

      (2) Accessibility requirements as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 ) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35; and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and

      (3) Cost-effective energy conservation measures, identified in the PHA's most recently updated energy audit.

      (d) Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, in purchasing appliances, PHAs shall purchase appliances that are Energy Star products or Federal Energy Management Program designed products, unless the PHA determines that the purchase of these appliances is not cost effective.

      (e)  Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded or Capital Funds allocated after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the PHA determines and, in accordance with § 905.326, documents the determination that:

      (1) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;

      (2) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

      (3) The structure of the housing to be rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.

      § 905.314   Cost and other limitations.

#### § § 905.314

      (a)  Where the physical or management improvement costs will benefit programs other than Public Housing, such as the Housing Choice Voucher program or local revitalization programs, eligible administrative costs are limited to the amount directly attributable to the public housing program.

      (b)  The maximum project cost represents the total amount of public housing capital assistance used in connection with the development of a public housing project, and includes:

      (1) Project costs that are subject to the TDC limit (, HCC and Community Renewal Costs); and

      (2) Project costs that are not subject to the TDC limit (, Additional Project Costs). The total project cost to be funded with public housing capital assistance, as set forth in the proposal and as approved by HUD, becomes the maximum project cost stated in the ACC Amendment. Upon completion of the project, the actual project cost is determined based upon the amount of public housing capital assistance expended for the project, and this becomes the maximum project cost for purposes of the ACC Amendment.

      (c)  (1) Public housing funds, including Capital Funds, may not be used to pay for HCC and Community Renewal Costs in excess of the TDC limit, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, HOPE VI grantees will be eligible to request a TDC exception for public housing and HOPE VI funds awarded in FFY 1996 and prior years. PHAs may also request a TDC exception for integrated utility management, capital planning, and other capital and management activities that promote energy conservation and efficiency. HUD will examine the request for TDC exceptions to ensure that they would be cost-effective, so as to ensure that up-front expenditures subject to the exceptions would be justified by future cost savings.

      (2)  HUD will determine the TDC limit for a public housing project as follows:

      (i)  HUD will first determine the applicable “construction cost guideline” by averaging the current construction costs as listed in two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality for specific bedroom sizes and structure types. The two indices HUD will use for this purpose are the R.S. Means cost index for construction of “average” quality and the Marshall & Swift cost index for construction of “good” quality. HUD has the discretion to change the cost indices to other such indices that reflect comparable housing construction quality through a notice published in the

      (ii)  The construction cost guideline is then multiplied by the number of units for each bedroom size and structure type.

      (iii)  HUD will then multiply the resulting amounts from step 2 by 1.6 for elevator type structures and by 1.75 for nonelevator type structures.

      (iv)  The TDC limit for a project is calculated by adding the resulting amounts from step 3 for all the public housing units in the project.

      (3)  Additional project costs are not subject to the TDC limit.

      (4)  A PHA may use funding sources not subject to the TDC limit (e.g., Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, low-income housing tax credits, private donations, private financing, etc.) to cover project costs that exceed the TDC limit or the HCC limit described in this paragraph (c). Such funds, however, may not be used for items that would result in substantially increased operating, maintenance, or replacement costs, and must meet the requirements of section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989) (42 U.S.C. 3545). These funds must be included in the project development cost budget.

      (d)  (1)  A PHA may not use Capital Funds to pay for HCC in excess of the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (2)  HUD will determine the HCC limit as listed in at least two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality for specific bedroom sizes and structure types. The two indices HUD will use for this purpose are the R.S. Means cost index for construction of “average” quality and the Marshal & Swift cost index for construction of “good” quality. HUD has the discretion to change the cost indices to other such indices that reflect comparable housing construction quality through a notice published in the  The resulting construction cost guideline is then multiplied by the number of public housing units in the project, based upon bedroom size and structure type. The HCC limit for a project is calculated by adding the resulting amounts for all public housing units in the project.

      (3) The HCC limit is not applicable to the acquisition of existing housing, whether or not such housing will be rehabilitated. The TDC limit is applicable to such acquisition.

      (e)  Capital Funds may be used to pay for Community Renewal Costs in an amount equivalent to the difference between the HCC paid for with public housing capital assistance and the TDC limit.

      (f)  The HCC limit is not applicable to the rehabilitation of existing public housing projects. The TDC limit for modernization of existing public housing is 90 percent of the TDC limit as determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation does not apply to the rehabilitation of any property acquired pursuant to § 905.600 of this part.

      (g)  If the modernization costs are more than 90 percent of the TDC, then the project shall not be modernized. Capital Funds shall not be expended to modernize an existing public housing development that fails to meet the HUD definition of reasonable cost found in § 905.108 of this part, except for:

      (1) Emergency work;

      (2) Essential maintenance necessary to keep a public housing project habitable until the demolition or disposition application is approved; or

      (3) The costs of maintaining the safety and security of a site that is undergoing demolition.

      (h)  (1) Administrative cost limits (for non-asset-management PHAs). The PHA shall not budget or expend more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant on administrative costs, in accordance with the CFP 5-Year Action Plan.

      (2) Capital Fund Program Fee (for asset-management PHAs). For a PHA that is under asset management, the Capital Fund Program Fee and administrative cost limits are the same. For the Capital Fund Program Fee, a PHA may charge a management fee of up to 10 percent of the annual CFP formula grant(s) amount, excluding emergency and disaster grants and also excluding any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house architectural and engineering work, or other special administrative costs required by state or local law.

      (i) Modernization. The PHA shall not budget or expend more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant on administrative costs, in accordance with its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. The 10 percent limit excludes any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house Architectural and Engineering work, or other special administrative costs required by state or local law.

      (ii) Development. For development work with Capital Fund and RHF grants, the administrative cost limit is 3 percent of the total project budget, or, with HUD's approval, up to 6 percent of the total project budget.

      (i)  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, a PHA shall not use more than 18 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2015, a PHA shall not use more than 16 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2016, a PHA shall not use more than 14 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2017, a PHA shall not use more than 12 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2018 and thereafter, a PHA shall not use more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. Management improvements are an eligible expense for PHAs participating in asset management.

      (j)  A PHA may use force account labor for development and modernization activities if included in a CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD. HUD approval to use force account labor is not required when the PHA is designated as a high performer under PHAS.

      (k)  When the entire development, financing, or modernization activity, including the planning and architectural design, is administered by an RMC, the PHA shall not retain any portion of the Capital Funds for any administrative or other reason, unless the PHA and the RMC provide otherwise by contract.

      (l)  A PHA may use Capital Funds for operating costs only if it is included in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, and limited as described in paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section. Capital Funds identified in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan to be transferred to operations are obligated once the funds have been budgeted and drawn down by the PHA. Once such transfer of funds occurs, the PHA must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 990 with respect to those funds.

      (1)  A PHA with 250 or more units may use no more than 20 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for activities that are eligible under the Operating Fund at 24 CFR part 990.

      (2)  A PHA with less than 250 units, that is not designated as troubled under PHAS, may use up to 100 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for activities that are eligible under the Operating Fund at 24 CFR part 990, except that the PHA must have determined that there are no debt service payments, significant Capital Fund needs, or emergency needs that must be met prior to transferring 100 percent of its funds to operating expenses.

      § 905.316   Procurement and contract requirements.

#### § § 905.316

      (a)  PHAs shall comply with 2 CFR part 200, and HUD implementing instructions, for all capital activities including modernization and development, except as provided in paragraph (c) in this section.

      (b)  The PHA shall use all contract forms prescribed by HUD. If a form is not prescribed, the PHA may use any Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved form that contains all applicable federal requirements and contract clauses.

      (c)  Mixed-finance development partners may be selected in accordance with 24 CFR 905.604(h). Contracts and other agreements with mixed-finance development partners must specify that they comply with the requirements of §§ 905.602 and 905.604 of this part.

      (d)  Notwithstanding 24 CFR 85.36 (as revised April 1, 2013), for each construction contract over $100,000, the contractor shall furnish the PHA with the following:

      (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder, equivalent to 5 percent of the bid price; and

      (2) One of the following:

      (i) A performance bond and payment bond for 100 percent of the contract price;

      (ii) A performance bond and a payment bond, each for 50 percent or more of the contract price;

      (iii) A 20 percent cash escrow;

      (iv) A 10 percent irrevocable letter of credit with terms acceptable to HUD, or

      (v) Any other payment method acceptable to HUD.

      (e)  PHAs that are state agencies and agencies of a political subdivision of a state that are using assistance under this part for procurement, and any person contracting with such PHAs with respect to work performed under an assisted contract, must comply with the requirements of section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In accordance with section 6002, these agencies and persons must procure items designated in guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered material practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired in the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; must procure solid waste management services in a manner that promotes energy and resource recovery; and must have established an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines.

      § 905.318   Title and deed.

#### § § 905.318

      The PHA, or, in the case of mixed-finance, the Owner Entity, shall obtain title insurance that guarantees the title is good and marketable before taking title to any and all sites and properties acquired with public housing funds. Immediately upon taking title to a property, the PHA or Owner Entity shall record the deed and a Declaration of Trust or, in the case of mixed finance, a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, in the form and in the manner and order prescribed by HUD. The PHA shall at all times maintain a recorded Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants in the form and in the manner and order prescribed by HUD on all public housing projects covering the term required by this part.

      § 905.320   Contract administration and acceptance of work.

#### § § 905.320

      (a)  The PHA is responsible, in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, for all contractual and administrative issues arising out of their procurements. The PHA shall maintain full and complete records on the history of each procurement transaction.

      (b)  The PHA, or, in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity shall carry out inspections of work in progress and goods delivered, as necessary, to ensure compliance with existing contracts. If, upon inspection, the PHA determines that the work and/or goods are complete, satisfactory and, as applicable, otherwise undamaged, except for any work that is appropriate for delayed completion, the PHA shall accept the work. The PHA shall determine any holdback for items of delayed completion and the amount due and payable for the work that has been accepted, including any conditions precedent to payment that are stated in the construction contract or contract of sale. The contractor shall be paid for items only after the PHA inspects and accepts that work.

      (c)  The PHA or, in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity, shall specify the guaranty period and amounts to be withheld, as applicable, and shall provide that all contractor, manufacturer, and supplier warranties required by the construction and modernization documents shall be assigned to the PHA. The PHA shall inspect each dwelling unit and the overall project approximately 3 months after the beginning of the project guaranty period, 3 months before its expiration, and at other times as may be necessary to exercise its rights before expiration of any warranties. The PHA shall require repair or replacement of all defective items prior to the expiration of the guaranty or warranty periods.

      (d)  The PHA, or in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity, shall require that all contractors and developers notify the PHA in writing when the contract work, including any approved off-site work, will be completed and ready for inspection.

      § 905.322   Fiscal closeout.

#### § § 905.322

      (a)  Each Capital Fund grant and/or development project is subject to fiscal closeout. Fiscal closeout includes the submission of a cost certificate; an audit, if applicable; a final Performance and Evaluation Report; and HUD approval of the cost certificate.

      (b)  (1) When an approved development or modernization activity is completed or when HUD terminates the activity, the PHA must submit to HUD the:

      (i) Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) within 12 months. For purposes of the CF ACC, costs incurred between the completion of the development and the date of full availability (DOFA) becomes the actual development cost; and

      (ii) Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) for each grant, no later than 12 months after the expenditure deadline but no earlier than the obligation end date. A PHA with under 250 units with an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan for use of 100 percent of the Capital Fund grant in operations may submit the cost certificate any time after the funds have been budgeted to operations and withdrawn, as described in § 905.314(l) of this part.

      (2) If the PHA does not submit the cost certificate and the final CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report within the period prescribed in this section, HUD may impose restrictions on open Capital Fund grants; e.g., establish review thresholds, set the grant to “auto review” (HUD automatically reviews it on a periodic basis), or suspend grants, until the cost certificate for the affected grant is submitted. These restrictions may be imposed by HUD after notification of the PHA.

      (c)  The cost certificate is a financial statement subject to audit pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. After submission of the cost certificate to HUD, the PHA shall provide the cost certificate to its independent public auditor (IPA) as part of its annual audit. After audit, the PHA will notify HUD of the grants included in the audit, any exceptions noted by the PHA auditor, and the schedule to complete corrective actions recommended by the auditor.

      (d)  For PHAs exempt from the audit requirements, HUD will review and approve the cost certificate based on available information regarding the Capital Fund grant. For PHAs subject to an audit, HUD will review the information from the annual audit provided by the PHA and approve the certificate after all exceptions, if any, have been resolved.

      (e)  All Capital Funds in excess of the actual cost incurred for the grant are subject to recapture. Any funds awarded to the PHA that are returned or any funds taken back from the PHA in a fiscal year after the grant was awarded are subject to recapture.

      (b) The PHA shall retain for 5 years after HUD approves either the actual development or modernization cost certificate all documents related to the activities for which the Capital Fund grant was received, unless a longer period is required by applicable law.

      (c) HUD and its duly authorized representatives shall have full and free access to all PHA offices, facilities, books, documents, and records, including the right to audit and make copies.

    Subpart D—Capital Fund Formula

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 63773, Oct. 24, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.400   Capital Fund formula (CF formula).

#### § § 905.400

      (a)  This section describes the formula for allocating Capital Funds to PHAs.

      (b)  HUD shall allocate Capital Funds to the PHAs in accordance with the CF formula. The CF formula measures the existing modernization needs and accrual needs of PHAs.

      (c)  HUD shall allocate one-half of the available Capital Fund amount based on the relative existing modernization needs of PHAs, determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (d)  The estimates of the existing modernization needs for these PHAs shall be based on the following:

      (1) Objective measurable data concerning the following PHA, community, and project characteristics applied to each project:

      (i) The average number of bedrooms in the units in a project (Equation coefficient 4604.7);

      (ii) The total number of units in a project (Equation coefficient: 10.17);

      (iii) The proportion of units in a project in buildings completed in 1978 or earlier. In the case of acquired projects, HUD will use the DOFA unless the PHA provides HUD with the actual date of construction completion. When the PHA provides the actual date of construction completion, HUD will use that date (or, for scattered sites, the average dates of construction of all the buildings), subject to a 50-year cap. (Equation coefficient: 4965.4);

      (iv) The cost index of rehabilitating property in the area (Equation coefficient: −10608);

      (v) The extent to which the units of a project were in a nonmetropolitan area as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) during FFY 1996 (Equation coefficient: 2703.9);

      (vi) The PHA is located in the Southern census region, as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: −269.4);

      (vii) The PHA is located in the Western census region, as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: −1709.5);

      (viii) The PHA is located in the Midwest census region as defined by the Census Bureau (Equation coefficient: 246.2); and

      (2) An equation constant of 13851.

      (i)  Units with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (ii)  Projects acquired by a PHA with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (3)  Prior to the cost calibration in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the number used for the existing modernization need of family projects shall be $16,680 in New York City and $24,286 in Chicago, and the number for elderly projects shall be $14,622 in New York City and $16,912 in Chicago.

      (i)  Units with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (ii)  Projects acquired by a PHA with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (4)  The estimates of the existing modernization need shall be based on the following:

      (i) Objective measurable data concerning the PHA, community, and project characteristics applied to each project:

      (A) The average number of bedrooms in the units in a project. (Equation coefficient: 1427.1);

      (B) The total number of units in a project. (Equation coefficient: 24.3);

      (C) The proportion of units in a project in buildings completed in 1978 or earlier. In the case of acquired projects, HUD shall use the DOFA date unless the PHA provides HUD with the actual date of construction completion, in which case HUD shall use the actual date of construction completion (or, for scattered sites, the average dates of construction of all the buildings), subject to a 50-year cap. (Equation coefficient: −1389.7);

      (D) The cost index of rehabilitating property in the area, as of FFY 1999. (Equation coefficient: −20163);

      (E) The extent to which the units of a project were in a nonmetropolitan area as defined by the Census Bureau during FFY 1996. (Equation coefficient: 6157.7);

      (F) The PHA is located in the Southern census region, as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: 4379.2);

      (G) The PHA is located in the Western census region, as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: 3747.7);

      (H) The PHA is located in the Midwest census region as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: −2073.5); and

      (ii) An equation constant of 24762.

      (A)  Units with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (B)  Projects acquired by a PHA with a DOFA date of October 1, 1991, or after, shall be considered by HUD to have a zero existing modernization need.

      (5)  The estimated existing modernization need determined under paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section shall be adjusted by the values of the cost index of rehabilitating property in the area.

      (6)  FFY 2008 is the last fiscal year that HUD will calculate the existing modernization need. The existing modernization need will be frozen for all developments at the calculation as of FFY 2008 and will be adjusted for changes in the inventory and paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

      (e)  HUD shall allocate the other half of the remaining Capital Fund amount based on the relative accrual needs of PHAs, determined in accordance with this paragraph of this section.

      (1) PHAs with 250 or more units, except the New York City and Chicago Housing Authorities. The estimates of the accrual need shall be based on the following:

      (i) Objective measurable data concerning the following PHA, community, and project characteristics applied to each project:

      (A) The average number of bedrooms in the units in a project. (Equation coefficient: 324.0);

      (B) The extent to which the buildings in a project average fewer than 5 units. (Equation coefficient: 93.3);

      (C) The age of a project, as determined by the DOFA date. In the case of acquired projects, HUD shall use the DOFA date unless the PHA provides HUD with the actual date of construction completion, in which case HUD shall use the actual date of construction (or, for scattered sites, the average dates of construction of all the buildings), subject to a 50-year cap. (Equation coefficient: −7.8);

      (D) Whether the development is a family project. (Equation coefficient: 184.5);

      (E) The cost index of rehabilitating property in the area. (Equation coefficient: −252.8);

      (F) The extent to which the units of a project were in a nonmetropolitan area as defined by the Census Bureau during FFY 1996. (Equation coefficient: −121.3);

      (G) PHA size of 6,600 or more units in FFY 1999. (Equation coefficient: −150.7);

      (H) The PHA is located in the Southern census region, as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: 28.4);

      (I) The PHA is located in the Western census region, as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: −116.9);

      (J) The PHA is located in the Midwest census region as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: 60.7); and

      (ii) An equation constant of 1371.9.

      (2) For the New York City and Chicago Housing Authorities, based on a large sample of direct inspections. Prior to the cost calibration in paragraph (e)(4) of this section the number used for the accrual need of family developments is $1,395 in New York City, and $1,251 in Chicago, and the number for elderly developments is $734 in New York City and $864 in Chicago.

      (3) PHAs with fewer than 250 units. The estimates of the accrual need shall be based on the following:

      (i) Objective measurable data concerning the following PHA, community, and project characteristics applied to each project:

      (A) The average number of bedrooms in the units in a project. (Equation coefficient: 325.5);

      (B) The extent to which the buildings in a project average fewer than 5 units. (Equation coefficient: 179.8);

      (C) The age of a project, as determined by the DOFA date. In the case of acquired projects, HUD shall use the DOFA date unless the PHA provides HUD with the actual date of construction completion.

      (I) The PHA is located in the Midwest census region as defined by the Census Bureau. (Equation coefficient: −418.3); and

      (ii) An equation constant of 3193.6.

      (4)  The estimated accrual need determined under either paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section shall be adjusted by the values of the cost index of rehabilitation.

      (f)  (1)  For purposes of determining the number of a PHA's public housing units and the relative modernization needs of PHAs:

      (i) HUD shall count as one unit:

      (A) Each public housing and section 23 bond-financed CF unit, except that each existing unit under the Turnkey III program shall count as one-fourth of a unit. Units receiving operating subsidy only shall not be counted.

      (B) Each existing unit under the Mutual Help program.

      (ii) HUD shall add to the overall unit count any units that the PHA adds to its inventory when the units are under CF ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the date that HUD establishes for the FFY in which the CF formula is being run (hereafter called the “reporting date”). New CF units and those reaching DOFA after the reporting date shall be counted for CF formula purposes in the following FFY.

      (2)  Replacement units newly constructed on or after October 1, 1998, that replace units in a project funded in FFY 1999 by the Comprehensive Grant formula system or the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system shall be given a new CF ACC number as a separate project and shall be treated as a newly constructed development as outlined in § 905.600 of this part.

      (3)  Reconfiguration of units may cause the need to be calculated by the new configuration based on the formula characteristics in the building and unit's PIC module (refer to the formula sections here). The unit counts will be determined by the CF units existing after the reconfiguration.

      (4)  For a project losing units as a result of demolition and disposition, the number of units on which the CF formula is based shall be the number of units reported as eligible for Capital Funds as of the reporting date. Units are eligible for funding until they are removed due to demolition and disposition in accordance with a schedule approved by HUD.

      (g)  (1)  The total estimated existing modernization need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated existing modernization need per unit, as determined by paragraph (d) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated project needs.

      (2)  The total accrual need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated accrual need per unit, as determined by paragraph (e) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated accrual needs.

      (3)  A PHA's formula share of existing modernization need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated existing modernization need divided by the total existing modernization need of all PHAs.

      (4)  A PHA's formula share of accrual need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated accrual need divided by the total existing accrual need of all PHAs.

      (5)  A PHA's formula share of capital need under the CF formula is the average of the PHA's share of existing modernization need and its share of accrual need (by which method each share is weighted 50 percent).

      (h)  (1) For units that are eligible for funding under the CF formula (including replacement housing units discussed below), a PHA's CF formula share shall be its share of capital need, as determined under the CF formula, subject to the condition that no PHA's CF formula share for units funded under the CF formula can be less than 94 percent of its formula share had the FFY 1999 formula system been applied to these CF formula-eligible units. The FFY 1999 formula system is based upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Grant formula system for PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999 and upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system for PHAs with fewer than 250 units in FFY 1999.

      (2) For a Moving to Work (MTW) PHA whose MTW agreement provides that its CF formula share is to be calculated in accordance with the previously existing formula, the PHA's CF formula share, during the term of the MTW agreement, may be approximately the formula share that the PHA would have received had the FFY 1999 formula funding system been applied to the CF formula eligible units.

      (i)  (1)  PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units attributable to demolition or disposition of units during the period (reflected in data maintained by HUD) that lowers the formula unit count for the CFF calculation qualify for application of an RHF, subject to satisfaction of criteria stated in paragraph (i)(5) of this section

      (2)  The RHF will be added, where applicable:

      (i) For the first 5 years after the reduction of units described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section; and

      (ii) For an additional 5 years if the planning, leveraging, obligation, and expenditure requirements are met. As a prior condition of a PHA's receipt of additional funds for replacement housing provided for the second 5-year period or any portion thereof, a PHA must obtain a firm commitment of substantial additional funds, other than public housing funds, for replacement housing, as determined by HUD.

      (3)  The RHF consists of the difference between the CFF share without the CFF share reduction of units attributable to demolition or disposition and the CFF share that resulted after the reduction of units attributable to demolition or disposition.

      (4)  Units that received replacement housing funding in FFY 1998 will be treated as if they had received 2 years of replacement housing funding by FFY 2000. Units that received replacement housing funding in FFY 1999 will be treated as if they had received one year of replacement housing funding as of FFY 2000.

      (5)  A PHA is eligible for this factor only if the PHA satisfies the following criteria:

      (i) The PHA will use the funding in question only for replacement housing;

      (ii) The PHA will use the restored funding that results from the use of the replacement factor to provide replacement housing in accordance with the PHA's 5-Year Action Plan, as approved by HUD under part 903 of this chapter as well as the PHA's Board of Commissioners;

      (iii) The PHA has not received funding for public housing units that will replace the lost units under Public Housing Development, Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing, HOPE VI, Choice Neighborhoods, Rental Assistance Payment (RAP), or programs that otherwise provide for replacement with public housing units;

      (iv) The PHA, if designated as a troubled PHA by HUD, and not already under the direction of HUD or an appointed receiver, in accordance with part 902 of this chapter, uses an Alternative Management Entity, as defined in part 902 of this chapter, for development of replacement housing and complies with any applicable provisions of its Memorandum of Agreement executed with HUD under that part; and

      (v) The PHA undertakes any development of replacement housing in accordance with applicable HUD requirements and regulations.

      (6)  (i) A PHA will be subject to the actions described in paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of this section if the PHA does not:

      (A) Use the restored funding that results from the use of the RHF to provide replacement housing in a timely fashion, as provided in paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section and in accordance with applicable HUD requirements and regulations, and

      (B) Make reasonable progress on such use of the funding, in accordance with applicable HUD requirements and regulations.

      (ii) If a PHA fails to act as described in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, HUD will require appropriate corrective action under these regulations, may recapture and reallocate the funds, or may take other appropriate action.

      (7)  (i) In addition to the requirements otherwise applicable to obligation and expenditure of funds, PHAs are required to obligate assistance received as a result of the RHF within:

      (A) 24 months from the date that funds become available to the PHA; or

      (B) With specific HUD approval, 24 months from the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds to undertake replacement housing.

      (ii) To the extent the PHA has not obligated any funds provided as a result of the RHF within the time frames required by this paragraph, or has not expended such funds within a reasonable time, HUD shall recapture the unobligated amount of the grant.

      (j)  (1)  In FFY 2014 and thereafter, PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units occurring in FFY 2013 and attributable to demolition or disposition are automatically eligible to receive Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding. The DDTF will be included in their annual Capital Fund grant for a 5-year period to offset the reduction in funding a PHA would receive from removing units from inventory. DDTF is subject to the criteria stated in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.

      (2)  DDTF will be added to a PHA's annual CFP grant, where applicable, for 5 years after the reduction of units described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

      (3)  The DDTF consists of the difference between the CFF share without the CFF share reduction of units attributable to demolition or disposition and the CFF share that resulted after the reduction of units attributable to demolition or disposition.

      (4)  A PHA is eligible for this factor only if the PHA satisfies the following criteria:

      (i) The PHA will automatically receive the DDTF for reduction of units in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section, unless the PHA rejects the DDTF funding for that fiscal year in writing;

      (ii) The PHA will use the funding in question for eligible activities under the Capital Fund Program, found at 905.200—such as modernization and development—that are included in the PHA's HUD approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan.

      (iii) The PHA has not received funding for public housing units that will replace the lost units from disposition proceeds, or under Public Housing Development, Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing, HOPE VI, Choice Neighborhoods, RAP, or programs that otherwise provide for replacement with public housing units;

      (iv) The PHA, if designated as a troubled PHA by HUD, and not already under the direction of HUD or an appointed receiver, in accordance with part 902 of this chapter, uses an Alternative Management Entity, as defined in part 902 of this chapter, and complies with any applicable provisions of its Memorandum of Agreement executed with HUD under that part; and

      (v) The PHA undertakes any eligible activities in accordance with applicable HUD requirements and regulations.

      (5)  (i) In addition to the requirements otherwise applicable to obligation and expenditure of Capital Funds, including 42 U.S.C. 1437g(j) and the terms of the appropriation from Congress, PHAs are required to obligate funds received as a result of the DDTF within 24 months from the date that funds become available to the PHA; or

      (ii) To the extent the PHA has not obligated any funds provided as a result of the DDTF within the time frames required by this paragraph, or expended such funds within a reasonable time frame, HUD shall reduce the amount of DDTF to be provided to the PHA.

      (k)  (1) PHAs that would be newly eligible for RHF in FFY 2014 will receive 5 years of DDTF.

      (2) PHAs that received a portion of a first increment RHF grant in FY 2013, for units removed from inventory prior to the reporting date of June 30, 2012, will receive up to 10 years of funding consisting of the remainder of first-increment RHF, subject to the requirements of § 905.400(i) of this part, and, if eligible, 5 years of DDTF, subject to the requirements of § 905.400(j) of this part.

      (3) PHAs that received a portion of a second increment RHF grant in FY 2013, for units removed from inventory prior to the reporting date of June 30, 2012, will continue to receive the remaining portion of the 5-year increment as a separate second increment RHF grant, as described in § 905.400(i) of this part.

      (l)  (1)  A PHA that is designated a high performer under the PHA's most recent final PHAS score may receive a performance bonus that is:

      (i) Three (3) percent above its base formula amount in the first 5 years these awards are given (for any year in this 5-year period in which the performance reward is earned); or

      (ii) Five (5) percent above its base formula amount in future years (for any year in which the performance reward is earned);

      (2)  The performance bonus is subject only to the condition that no PHA will lose more than 5 percent of its base formula amount as a result of the redistribution of funding from nonhigh performers to high performers.

      (3)  The total amount of Capital Funds that HUD has recaptured or not allocated to PHAs as a sanction for violation of expenditure and obligation requirements shall be allocated to the PHAs that are designated high performers under PHAS.

    Subpart E—Use of Capital Funds for Financing

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 65208, Oct. 21, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.500   Purpose and description.

#### § § 905.500

      (a) This subpart provides the requirements necessary for a PHA to participate in the Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP), under which the PHA may obtain HUD approval to borrow private capital and pledge a portion of its annual Capital Fund grant or public housing assets and other public housing property of the public housing agency as security.

      (b) Under the CFFP, PHAs are permitted to borrow private capital to finance public housing development or modernization activities. A PHA may use a portion of its Capital Fund for debt service payments and usual and customary financing costs associated with public housing development or modernization (including public housing in mixed-finance developments). A PHA that undertakes such financing activities may, subject to HUD's written approval, grant a security interest in its future annual Capital Fund grants, which shall be subject to the appropriation of those funds by Congress. The PHA's financing activities are not obligations or liabilities of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not assume any liability with respect to any such pledge of future appropriations, and the Federal Government neither guarantees nor provides any full faith and credit for these financing transactions.

      § 905.505   Program requirements.

#### § § 905.505

      (a)  A PHA shall obtain written HUD approval for all Capital Fund financing transactions that pledge, encumber, or otherwise provide a security interest in public housing assets or other property, including Capital Funds, and use Capital Funds for the payment of debt service or other financing costs. HUD approval shall be based on:

      (1) The ability of the PHA to complete the financing transaction along with the associated improvements;

      (2) The reasonableness of the provisions in the Capital Fund Financing Proposal considering the other pledges or commitments of public housing assets, the PHA's capital needs, and the pledge being proposed; and

      (3) Whether the PHA meets the requirements of this subpart.

      (b)  Any pledge of future year Capital Fund grants under this section is subject to the availability of appropriations by Congress for that year. All financing documents related to future year Capital Fund amounts must include a statement that the pledging of funds is subject to the availability of appropriations.

      (c) —(1)  Any public housing that is developed using amounts under this part (including proceeds from financing authorized under this part) shall be operated under the terms and conditions applicable to public housing during the 40-year period that begins on the date on which the project becomes available for occupancy, except as otherwise provided in the 1937 Act.

      (2)  Any public housing or portion of public housing that is modernized using amounts under this part (including proceeds from financing authorized under this part) shall be maintained and operated during the 20-year period that begins on the latest date on which the modernization is completed, except as otherwise provided in the 1937 Act.

      (3)  Public housing subject to the use conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section, or to any other provision of law mandating the operation of housing as public housing for a specific length of time, shall be maintained and operated as required until the latest such expiration date.

      (4)  All public housing rental projects must show evidence satisfactory to HUD of an effective Declaration of Trust being recorded in first position, meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and covering the term of the financing. If part of a mixed-finance project, this evidence will be with the mixed-finance evidentiary documents.

      (d)  Generally, a PHA shall be designated a standard performer or high performer under PHAS (24 CFR part 902), and must be a standard performer or higher on the management and financial condition indicators. HUD will consider requests from a PHA designated as troubled under PHAS when the PHA is able to show that it has developed appropriate management and financial capability and controls that demonstrate its ability to successfully undertake the Capital Fund Financing Proposal. The PHA must comply with all applicable fair housing and civil rights requirements in 24 CFR 5.105(a). If a PHA has received a letter of findings, charge, or lawsuit involving ongoing systemic noncompliance under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Fair Housing Act, or Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and the letter of findings, charge, or lawsuit has not been resolved to HUD's satisfaction, then unless the Capital Fund Financing Proposal is part of a plan to address such findings, charge, or lawsuit, the PHA will not be eligible for financing pursuant to the CFFP. HUD will determine if actions to resolve the charge, lawsuit, or letter of findings taken are sufficient to resolve the matter.

      (e)  A PHA shall have the capacity to undertake and administer private financing and construction or modernization of the size and type contemplated. In order to determine capacity, HUD may require the PHA to submit a management assessment conducted by an independent third party, in a form and manner prescribed by HUD.

      (f)  A PHA shall identify the nature and extent of any existing encumbrances, pledges, or other financing commitments of public housing funds undertaken by the PHA.

      (g)  (1) A PHA must complete a physical needs assessment at the project level, in the form and manner prescribed by HUD that covers the PHA's entire public housing portfolio for the term of the financing and that takes into consideration existing needs and the lifecycle repair and replacement of major building components. The activity to be financed must be identified as a need in the physical needs assessment.

      (2) Based on the assessment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the PHA must demonstrate that the financing will not negatively impact the ability of the PHA to meet the ongoing needs of its public housing portfolio over the term of the financing. In making this demonstration, PHAs must reduce any projected future Capital Fund grants to account for planned or anticipated activities that would have the effect of reducing or otherwise limiting the availability of future Capital Fund grants. PHA projections must be detailed on the portfolio schedule form prescribed by HUD, and shall project a stabilized number of units (Stabilized Base Unit Count) to be reached in no more than 5 years after all planned or anticipated activities have been completed that would reduce future Capital Fund grants. PHAs must also take into consideration projected use of Capital Funds for other eligible activities under part 905, and may take into consideration alternative sources of financing that are available to help meet its needs.

      (3) For PHAs that are proposing to borrow more than $2 million on a cumulative basis, to the extent that:

      (i) Capital and other eligible Capital Fund needs exceed projected Capital Fund program funding amounts, and the PHA is not leveraging non-public housing funds as part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal transaction, then

      (ii) The PHA must demonstrate that it has considered leveraging non-public housing funds, and state why the proposed financing is appropriate in light of alternative sources available.

      (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, PHAs that size their financing by utilizing only replacement housing factor (RHF) funds, or PHAs that propose to use their Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds as part of a mixed-finance modernization transaction, are not required to comply with § 905.505(g).

      (h)  (1) The use of the CFFP proceeds shall be included in a form and manner as required by HUD for CFP planning and budgeting and in a same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The CFFP proceeds shall be included as a separate Capital Fund grant to the same extent that PHAs are required to plan and budget Capital Fund grants. The use of Capital Funds for the payment of debt service and related costs shall be planned and budgeted as would other eligible uses of Capital Funds.

      (2) As part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal, the PHA shall submit a Capital Fund financing budget, in the form and manner required by HUD, detailing the proposed use of the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds. There shall be no requirement for PHAs to submit a Capital Fund financing budget as part of their Capital Fund financing proceeds where the sizing of the financing is based upon the use of RHF funds for debt service, or where the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds are being used as part of a mixed-finance transaction. Approval letters for mixed-finance and RHF-related Capital Fund financing transactions shall be conditioned upon the approval of the mixed-finance proposal, or, in the case of conventional development, upon the approval of the development proposal and the execution of an associated construction contract with which the Capital Fund financing proceeds would be used.

      (3) The work financed with Capital Funds and described in the Capital Fund financing budget will be based on the physical needs assessment. The Capital Fund financing budget shall list the work items (e.g., roof replacement, window replacement, accessibility modifications) by development. These work items will constitute performance measures upon which the PHA's performance will be evaluated. A general representation of the work (e.g., “rehabilitation of the development”) is not sufficient.

      (4) The CFP Plan (submission (as described in paragraph (h) of this section) shall include a copy of the physical needs assessment described in § 905.505(g).

      (5) Financing proceeds under this part may be used only for the modernization or development of public housing and related costs including the modernization or development of non-dwelling space. Financing proceeds may not be used for administration or central office cost center costs (except for mixed-finance projects), management improvements, or upon non-viable projects, such as those subject to required conversion. Financing proceeds may be used to reimburse predevelopment costs, but only to the extent they were incurred in conformance with applicable regulatory requirements.

      (i)  (1) Except as stated in § 905.505(i)(2), a PHA shall not pledge more than 33 percent of its annual future Capital Fund grants for debt service payments, assuming level Capital Fund appropriations over the term of the debt obligation and any reduction attributable to activities projected by the PHA to occur during the term of the financing such as demolition, disposition, or conversion of public housing units or other occurrences that could limit the availability of Capital Funds, including a voluntary compliance agreement. This percentage of Capital Funds dedicated for debt service, taking into account adjustments for activities that would reduce the receipt of Capital Funds, is called the “_Debt Coverage Percentage._”

      (2) A PHA may pledge up to 100 percent of any projected replacement housing factor (RHF) grants for debt service payments, provided that the pledge extends to the formula fund portion of its Capital Fund grants also, but that not more than 50 percent of its overall projected Capital Fund grants (including formula funds and RHF funds) are pledged. RHF projections shall account for any projected reductions in RHF over the term of the financing. Unless otherwise approved by HUD, PHAs shall be limited to sizing their loans based upon increments of RHF currently being received by the PHA. CFFP transactions pledging RHF funds shall include accelerated amortization provisions, requiring all RHF funds received by the PHA to pay debt service as those RHF funds are received. A RHF grant shall be used only to develop or pay financing costs for the development of replacement public housing units in accordance with § 905.10.

      (3) Subject to the reasonableness test in § 905.505(a)(2), PHAs may exceed 33 percent when pledging existing Capital Fund grants and RHF grants for the payment of debt service. Existing grants are grants that have been received by the PHA at the time of HUD's approval of the Capital Fund Financing Proposal.

      (j)  The terms and conditions of all financing shall be reasonable based on current market conditions. The financing documents shall include the following, as applicable:

      (1)  The term of the Capital Fund financing transaction shall not be more than 20 years. All Capital Fund financing transactions shall be fully amortizing. Bridge loans and other short-term loans are permitted; however, unless otherwise approved by HUD, the CFFP Financing transaction may not be structured in a manner that generates program income.

      (2)  Unless otherwise approved by HUD, the financing documents shall provide that HUD approval is required before a lender may accelerate a PHA's debt obligation, for default or otherwise.

      (3)  A PHA may not pledge any public housing assets unless specifically approved in writing by HUD. PHAs seeking approval of a pledge of public housing assets must submit documentation to HUD that details the nature and priority of the pledge.

      (4)  All variable-rate transactions shall include an interest-rate cap. The financing documents must specify that the PHA shall not be liable to pay debt service with public housing funds, and that there shall be no recourse to public housing assets, beyond the interest-rate cap. The limitation on the pledge of Capital Funds specified in § 905.505(i) shall be calculated based on the interest-rate cap.

      (5)  PHAs seeking approval of a pledge of public housing assets must describe the nature and extent of existing commitments or pledges of public housing assets, providing documentation of such other commitments or pledges to the extent required by HUD.

      (6)  Financing documents must include any other terms and conditions as required by HUD.

      (k)  The PHA shall provide an opinion, in a form and manner prescribed by HUD, from a qualified, independent, third-party financial advisor attesting that the terms and conditions of the proposed financing transaction are reasonable given current market conditions with respect to such matters as interest rate, fees, costs of issuance, call provisions, and reserve fund requirements.

      (l)  (1) The PHA shall have a financial control and construction management plan describing how the PHA will ensure that:

      (i) Adequate controls are in place regarding the use of the Capital Fund financing proceeds; and

      (ii) The improvements will be developed and completed in a timely manner consistent with the contract documents.

      (2) This plan shall contain protocols and financial control mechanisms that address the design of the improvements, construction inspections, construction draws, and requisition approval checks and balances. A PHA that is designated troubled under PHAS, or other PHAs as determined by HUD, may be required to institute risk mitigation measures to ensure that the funds are used properly and for the purposes intended.

      (m)  To the extent that any changes in work items financed by Capital Fund financing proceeds meet or exceed the following threshold requirements determined by HUD, PHAs must obtain written approval of amendments to their Capital Fund financing budget from HUD:

      (1) A change in the type of activity being financed (for example, if the approved Capital Fund financing budget contemplated the proceeds being used for modernization, but after the proposal is approved, the PHA decides instead to pursue development);

      (2) A change in the project being modernized or developed with the proceeds;

      (3) A reduction in 20 percent or more in the number of public housing units being modernized; or

      (4) An increase of 20 percent or more of the cost of non-dwelling space.

      (n)  The proceeds of the Capital Fund financing are subject to all laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to the use of Capital Fund grants made under 24 CFR part 905, unless otherwise approved by HUD in writing. PHAs undertaking CFFP transactions shall be subject to the following requirements, which shall be further enumerated in a Capital Fund Financing Amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (CFF ACC Amendment):

      (1) Amounts payable to the PHA by HUD pursuant to the CFFP and pledged to the payment of debt service by the PHA shall be used exclusively for debt service in accordance with the debt service schedule approved by HUD and shall not be available for any other purpose;

      (2) The financing does not constitute a debt or liability of HUD or the United States, the full faith and credit of the United States are not pledged to the payment of debt service, and debt service is not guaranteed by HUD or the United States;

      (3) Nothing in this CFF ACC Amendment or 24 CFR part 905 is intended to diminish HUD's authority to administer, monitor, and regulate the public housing program, including HUD's authority to exercise any administrative sanction or remedy provided by law; provided, however, that except as required by law, HUD will not assert any claim or right under the ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions and remedies, if and to the extent that the effect of such claim or right would be to reduce the payment of Capital Fund moneys to the PHA below the level necessary to pay debt service or delay the time for payment of such moneys such that required amounts would not be available to pay debt service when due;

      (4) The financing is subject to mandatory prepayment prior to the obligation end date and expenditure end date of the Capital Fund financing proceeds to the extent necessary for the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds to comply with section 9(j) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(j)). Bond and loan documents shall include appropriate provisions such that prepayment shall be made by the lender, trustee, or appropriate third-party servicer approved by HUD, without any action by HUD post-approval;

      (5) HUD agrees, subject to the availability of appropriations, to approve immediately upon receipt from the PHA (subject to any legal requirements or constraints applicable at the time), a CFP Plan document (as described in 24 CFR 905.505(h)) and/or an annual CFF ACC Amendment, to the extent and in an amount sufficient to make the applicable debt service payment;

      (6) Prior to cumulatively reducing its inventory of public housing units by more than 5 percent of the Stabilized Base Unit Count, if, after the removal of units from inventory, the Debt Coverage Percentage under § 905.505(i)(1) would constitute more than 33 percent of future Capital Funds, the PHA shall prepay the financing such that the reduction in inventory shall not cause the Debt Coverage Percentage to increase. If the reduction in inventory is required by law or public housing requirements, the prepayment is not required to be made prior to the reduction in inventory, but instead shall be made as soon as possible after the PHA becomes aware of the requirement of law or public housing requirements, but only to the extent that Capital Funds are not otherwise needed by the PHA to address the health and safety issues or other requirements of law in the PHA's public housing portfolio, all as determined by HUD. For PHAs that size their loans based upon the projected receipt of RHF funds, prior to undertaking an activity that will reduce its RHF units below the number of units projected in the Capital Fund Financing Proposal as required by § 905.505(i)(3), the PHA shall prepay its loan such that debt service does not exceed 100 percent of projected RHF after accounting for the reduction in RHF units, all as determined by HUD.

      (o)  Pursuant to 24 CFR 905.505(h) a PHA is required to identify in its CFP Plan documents specific items of work that will be accomplished using the proceeds of the proposed financing. The identified items, which shall be quantifiable, shall be the basis on which HUD evaluates a PHA's performance. HUD may also utilize the Capital Fund financing budget, and Capital Fund Financing Proposal approval documents as the basis to evaluate a PHA's performance. Failure to meet performance measures may result in:

      (1) Failure to receive HUD approval for future financing transactions;

      (2) Failure to be considered for future competitive grant programs; and

      (3) Other sanctions HUD deems appropriate and authorized by law or regulation.

      (p)  (1) The use of the CFFP proceeds shall be reported in the same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The PHA shall submit a performance and evaluation report on a quarterly basis. PHAs that utilize their Capital Fund financing proceeds as part of a mixed-finance transaction, and PHAs that size their financing based upon RHF in their Capital Fund financing transactions, are not required to submit quarterly reports.

      (2) Each CFFP transaction and/or development project is subject to fiscal closeout in the same manner of a Capital Fund grant. Fiscal closeout includes the submission of an Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC), an audit, if applicable, a final quarterly report, and a final Performance and Evaluation report.

      § 905.507   Streamlined application requirements for standard and high-performing PHAs.

#### § § 905.507

      (a) PHAs with cumulative CFFP borrowings of less than $2 million and that are standard or high performers under PHAS; PHAs that are high performers under PHAS with cumulative CFFP borrowings of less than $20 million; PHAs that propose to use their CFFP proceeds in a mixed-finance transaction, or proposals where the sizing of the financing is based only upon the use of RHF funds for debt service, shall not be required to submit:

      (1) A third-party management assessment under § 905.505(e);

      (2) A third-party fairness opinion under § 905.505(k);

      (7)  The PHA must submit evidence of a PHA Board resolution that authorizes the PHA to: Undertake the loan up to a specified amount, provide all security interests required by the loan, and repay the loan with Capital Funds (including RHF funds, when applicable) as required by the financing documents. The Board resolution must also provide authorization for the Executive Director or other executive staff to negotiate and enter into all legal documents required as part of the transaction. The PHA must submit PHA counsel's opinion, which opines that the PHA has the authority to enter into the transaction, and affirms that the transaction complies with the requirements of the 1937 Act, as amended; Federal regulations; and the ACC, as amended.

      (8)  The PHA must submit a Depository Agreement (form HUD-51999) and a CFF ACC Amendment.

      (9) Other documents as required by HUD.

      § 905.515   HUD review and approval.

#### § § 905.515

      (a) After receipt of a Capital Fund Financing Proposal, HUD shall review the proposal for completeness. HUD will return to the PHA all incomplete or unapprovable proposals, identifying the deficiencies, and will not take any further action. HUD will also return proposals submitted by entities other than the PHA (e.g., the PHA's consultants). HUD shall review all complete proposals for compliance with the requirements under this subpart. HUD may require the PHA to make modifications to any of the CFFP documents submitted and may require the PHA to resubmit all or any portion of the proposal. After HUD determines that a proposal complies with all applicable requirements, HUD shall notify the PHA in writing of its approval and any condition(s) of the approval.

      (b) (1) A copy or copies of the CFF ACC Amendment shall accompany the approval letter.

      (2) Within 60 days of the date of HUD's approval of the transaction or, if HUD sets conditions on its approval, within 60 days of the date that the PHA satisfies such conditions (as evidenced by documentation retained in the PHA's file and available to HUD upon request), but in no event longer than 120 days after the HUD approval, unless the time has otherwise been extended by HUD in writing, the PHA must submit:

      (i) Closing documents as directed by HUD; and

      (ii) All documents required by HUD to take certain actions such as initiating debt service payments through HUD's automated systems.

      (3) Failure to provide the required documents to HUD within the time frame required under § 905.515(b)(2) may result in HUD rescinding its approval.

    Subpart F—Development Requirements

**Source:** Source: 78 FR 63786, Oct. 24, 2013, unless otherwise noted.

      § 905.600   General.

#### § § 905.600

      (a)  This subpart F applies to the development of public housing units to be included under an ACC and which will receive funding from public housing funds. PHAs must comply, or cause the Owner Entity and its contractors to comply, as applicable, with all of the applicable requirements in this subpart. Pursuant to § 905.106 of this part, when a PHA, a PHA partner, and/or an Owner Entity submits a development proposal and, if applicable, a site acquisition proposal, and executes an ACC covering the public housing units being developed, it is deemed to have certified by those executed submissions its compliance with this subpart. Noncompliance with any provision of this subpart or other applicable statutes or regulations, or the ACC Amendment, and any amendment thereto may subject the PHA, the PHA's partner and/or the Owner Entity to sanctions contained in § 905.804 of this part.

      (b)  A PHA may develop public housing through the construction of new units or the acquisition, with or without rehabilitation, of existing units. A PHA may use any generally accepted method of development including, but not limited to:

      (1)  The PHA designs a project on a property it owns. The PHA then competitively selects an entity to build or rehabilitate the project.

      (2)  The PHA advertises for and competitively selects a developer who will develop public housing units on a site owned or to be owned by the developer. Following HUD approval of the development proposal, the PHA and the developer execute a contract of sale and the developer builds the project. Once the project is complete, the developer sells it to the PHA.

      (3)  The PHA acquires an existing property that requires substantial, moderate, or no repair. Any repair work is done by PHA staff or contracted out by the PHA. The PHA must certify that the property was not constructed with the intent of selling it to the PHA or, alternatively, the PHA must certify that HUD requirements were followed in the development of the property.

      (4)  The PHA uses staff to carry out new construction or rehabilitation, as provided in § 905.314(j) of this part.

      (5)  Development or modernization of public housing units where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a PHA, pursuant to Section 905.604.

      (c)  The general development process for public housing development, using any method and with any financing, is as follows:

      (1) The PHA will identify a site to be acquired or a public housing project to be developed or redeveloped. The PHA or its Partner and/or the Owner Entity will prepare a site acquisition proposal pursuant to § 905.608 of this part and/or a development proposal pursuant to § 905.606 of this part for submission to HUD or as otherwise directed by HUD. The PHA may request predevelopment funding necessary for preparation of the acquisition proposal and/or development proposal, as stated in § 905.612(a) of this part.

      (2) The PHA must consult with affected residents prior to submission of an acquisition proposal, development proposal, or both to HUD to solicit resident input into development of the public housing project.

      (3) After HUD approval of the site acquisition proposal and/or development proposal, HUD and the PHA shall execute the applicable ACC Amendment for the public housing units and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants on all property acquired and/or to be developed. The PHA may then commence development of the units.

      (4) Upon completion of the public housing project, the PHA will establish the DOFA. After the DOFA, the PHA will submit a cost certificate to HUD attesting to the actual cost of the project that will be subject to audit.

      (d)  A PHA may engage in development activities using any one or a combination of the following sources of funding:

      (1) Capital Funds;

      (2) HOPE VI funds;

      (3) Choice Neighborhoods funds;

      (4) Proceeds from the sale of units under a homeownership program in accordance with 24 CFR part 906;

      (5) Proceeds resulting from the disposition of PHA-owned land or improvements;

      (6) Private financing used in accordance with § 905.604 of this part, Mixed-finance development;

      (7) Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP) proceeds under § 905.500 of this part;

      (8) Proceeds resulting from an Operating Fund Financing Program (OFFP) approved by HUD pursuant to 24 CFR part 990; and

      (9) Funds available from any other eligible sources.

      § 905.602   Program requirements.

#### § § 905.602

      (a)  Except as provided under § 905.604(i) of this part for mixed-finance projects, the PHA must enter into a Cooperation Agreement with the applicable local governing body that includes sufficient authority to cover the public housing being developed under this subpart, or provide an opinion of counsel that the existing, amended, or supplementary Cooperation Agreement between the jurisdiction and the PHA includes the project or development.

      (b)  These requirements apply to the development (including new construction and acquisition) of public housing. All proposed new development projects must meet both of the following requirements:

      (1)  A PHA may not use Capital Funds to pay for the development cost of public housing units if such development would result in a net increase in the number of public housing units that the PHA owned, assisted, or operated on October 1, 1999. Subject to approval by the Secretary, a PHA may develop public housing units in excess of the limitation if:

      (i) The units are available and affordable to eligible low-income families and the CF formula does not provide additional funding for the specific purpose of constructing, modernizing, and operating such excess units; or

      (ii) The units are part of a mixed-finance project or otherwise leverage significant additional investment, and the cost of the useful life of the projects is less than the estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act.

      (2)  A PHA may not construct public housing unless the cost of construction is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units, including the amount required to establish, as necessary, an upfront reserve for replacement accounts for major repairs. A PHA shall provide evidence of compliance with this subpart either by:

      (i) Demonstrating through a cost comparison that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA proposes to construct the housing is less than the cost of acquisition of existing housing, with or without rehabilitation, in the same neighborhood; or

      (ii) Documenting that there is insufficient existing housing in the neighborhood to acquire.

      (c)  Nonpublic housing properties may be used in the development of public housing units provided all requirements of the 1937 Act and the development requirements of this part are met.

      (d)  Each proposed site to be newly acquired for a public housing project or for construction or rehabilitation of public housing must be reviewed and approved by the field office as meeting the following standards, as applicable:

      (1) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed. Adequate utilities (e.g., water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets shall be available to service the site.

      (2) The site and neighborhood shall be suitable to facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Executive Order 11063, and HUD regulations issued under these statutes.

      (3) The site for new construction shall not be located in an area of minority concentration unless:

      (i) There are already sufficient, comparable opportunities outside areas of minority concentration for housing minority families in the income range that is to be served by the proposed project; or

      (ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot feasibly be met otherwise in that housing market area. “Overriding housing needs” shall not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable if the only reason that these needs cannot otherwise feasibly be met is that, due to discrimination because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin, sites outside areas of minority concentration are unavailable.

      (4) The site for new construction shall not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to nonminority residents in the area.

      (5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after demolition of public housing units a PHA may construct public housing units on the original public housing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of replacement public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of public housing units demolished. One of the following criteria must be satisfied:

      (i) The number of public housing units being constructed is not more than 50 percent of the number of public housing units in the original development; or

      (ii) In the case of replacing an occupied development, the number of public housing units being constructed is the number needed to house current residents who want to remain at the site, so long as the number of public housing units being constructed is significantly fewer than the number being demolished; or

      (iii) The public housing units being constructed constitute no more than 25 units.

      (6) The site shall promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.

      (7) The site shall be free from adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, such as: Toxic or contaminated soils and substances; mudslide or other unstable soil conditions; flooding; septic tank backups or other sewage hazards; harmful air pollution or excessive smoke or dust; excessive noise or vibrations from vehicular traffic; insect, rodent, or vermin infestation; or fire hazards. The neighborhood shall not be seriously detrimental to family life. It shall not be filled with substandard dwellings nor shall other undesirable elements predominate, unless there is a concerted program in progress to remedy the undesirable conditions.

      (8) The site shall be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities; health services; and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of similar unassisted standard housing. The availability of public transportation must be considered.

      (9) The site shall be accessible to a range of jobs for low-income workers and for other needs. The availability of public transportation must be considered, and travel time and cost via public transportation and private automobile must not be excessive. This requirement may be given less consideration for elderly housing.

      (10) The project may not be built on a site that has occupants unless the relocation requirements at § 905.308(b)(9) of this part are met.

      (11) The site shall not be in an area that HUD has identified as having special flood hazards and in which the sale of flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, unless the development is covered by flood insurance required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and meets all applicable HUD standards and local requirements.

      (e)  All acquisition or rehabilitation activities carried out with public housing funds must comply with the provisions of § 905.308(b)(9).

      (f)  All activities under this part are subject to an environmental review by a responsible entity under HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR Part 58 and must comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 ) and the related laws and authorities listed at 24 CFR 58.5. HUD may make a finding in accordance with 24 CFR 58.11 and may perform the environmental review itself under the provisions of 24 CFR Part 50. In those cases where HUD performs the environmental review under 24 CFR Part 50, it will do so before approving a proposed project, and will comply with the requirements of NEPA and the related requirements at 24 CFR 50.4.

      § 905.604   Mixed-finance development.

#### § § 905.604

      (a)  Mixed-finance development refers to the development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a PHA. If the public housing units being developed are 100 percent owned by the PHA, the project is not a mixed-finance project and will be not be subject to mixed-finance development requirements. However, all other development requirements of part 905 are applicable, and, if the project includes both public housing funds and private funding for development, the project may be subject to other applicable program requirements; e.g., the Capital Fund Financing Program, Operating Fund Financing Program, Public Housing Mortgage Program, etc.

      (1)  There are various potential scenarios for the ownership structure of a mixed-finance project, such as: public housing units may be owned entirely by a private entity; a PHA may co-own with a private entity; or a PHA affiliate or instrumentality may own or co-own the units.

      (2)  PHAs may choose to enter into a partnership or other contractual arrangement with a third party entity for the mixed-finance development and/or ownership of public housing units.

      (3)  Funding for mixed-finance developments may include one or a combination of funding sources, pursuant to § 905.600(d) of this part.

      (4)  A mixed-finance project that involves modernization, rather than new construction, shall maintain the DOFA date that existed prior to modernization and shall be subject to the provisions of § 905.304(a)(2) of this part regarding the applicable period of obligation to operate the public housing units.

      (b)  (1)  The development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, using public housing, nonpublic housing, or a combination of public housing and nonpublic housing funds, where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than the PHA. A mixed-finance development may include 100 percent public housing (if there is an Owner Entity other than the PHA) or a mixture of public housing and nonpublic housing units.

      (2)  As defined in § 905.108 of this part.

      (3)  An instrumentality is an entity related to the PHA whose assets, operations, and management are legally and effectively controlled by the PHA, and through which PHA functions or policies are implemented, and which utilizes public housing funds or public housing assets for the purpose of carrying out public housing development functions of the PHA. An instrumentality assumes the role of the PHA, and is the PHA under the Public Housing Requirements, for purposes of implementing public housing development activities and programs, and must abide by the Public Housing Requirements. Instrumentalities must be authorized to act for and to assume such responsibilities. For purposes of development, ownership of public housing units by an instrumentality would be considered mixed-finance development.

      (4)  An affiliate is an entity, other than an instrumentality, formed by a PHA and in which a PHA has a financial or ownership interest or participates in its governance. The PHA has some measure of control over the assets, operations, or management of the affiliate, but such control does not rise to the level of control to qualify the entity as an instrumentality. For the purposes of development, ownership of public housing units by an affiliate would be considered mixed-finance development.

      (5)  As defined in § 905.108 of this part.

      (c)  Each mixed-finance project must be structured to:

      (1) Ensure the continued operation of the public housing units in accordance with all Public Housing Requirements;

      (2) Ensure that public housing funds committed to a mixed-finance project are used only to pay for costs associated with the public housing units, including such costs as demolition, site work, infrastructure, and common area improvements.

      (3) To ensure that the amount of public housing funds committed to a project is proportionate to the number of public housing units contained in the project. To meet this “pro rata test,” the proportion of public housing funds compared to total project funds committed to a project must not exceed the proportion of public housing units compared to total number of units contained in the project. For example, if there are a total of 120 units in the project and 50 are public housing units, the public housing units are 42 percent of the total number of units in the project. Therefore the amount of public housing funds committed to the project cannot exceed 42 percent of the total project budget, unless otherwise approved by the Secretary. However, if public housing funds are to be used to pay for more than the pro rata cost of common area improvements, HUD will evaluate the proposal to ensure that common area improvements will benefit the residents in the development in a mixed-income project; and

      (4) Ensure that the project is within the Total Development Cost (TDC) and Housing Construction Cost (HCC) limits pursuant to § 905.314(c) and (d) of this part.

      (d)  Except as provided in this section, development of a mixed-finance project under this subpart is subject to the same requirements as development of public housing by a PHA entirely with public housing funds, as stated in § 905.600 of this part. PHAs must submit an acquisition proposal under § 905.608 and/or a development proposal under § 905.606 or as otherwise specified by HUD.

      (e)  In the event of a conflict between the requirements for a mixed-finance project and other requirements of this subpart, the mixed-finance Public Housing Requirements shall apply, unless HUD determines otherwise.

      (f)  For purposes of this section only, any action or approval that is required by HUD pursuant to the requirements set forth in this section shall be construed to mean HUD Headquarters, unless the field office is authorized in writing by Headquarters to carry out a specific function in this section.

      (g)  Public housing units built in a mixed-financed development must be comparable in size, location, external appearance, and distribution to nonpublic housing units within the development.

      (h)  The requirements of 2 CFR part 200 and 24 CFR 905.316 are applicable to this subpart with the following exceptions:

      (1) PHAs may select a development partner using competitive proposals procedures for qualifications-based procurement, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation and compliance with TDC and other applicable cost limitations;

      (2) An Owner Entity (which, as a private entity, would normally not be subject to 2 CFR part 200) shall be required to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if HUD determines that the PHA or PHA instrumentality, or either of their members or employees, exercises significant decision making functions within the Owner Entity with respect to managing the development of the proposed units. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt such an Owner Entity from the need to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if it determines that the Owner Entity has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.

      (i)  If the Owner Entity or partner (or any other entity with an identity of interest with the Owner Entity or partner) of a mixed-finance project wants to serve as the general contractor for the mixed-finance project, it may award itself the construction contract only if:

      (1) The identity of interest general contractor's bid is the lowest bid submitted in response to a request for bids; or

      (2) The PHA submits a written justification to HUD that includes an independent third-party cost estimate that demonstrates that the identity of interest general contractor's costs are less than or equal to the independent third-party cost estimate; and

      (3) HUD approves the identity of interest general contractor in conjunction with HUD's approval of the development proposal for the mixed-finance project.

      (j)  (1)  This section refers to the mixed-finance development of public housing units that will be developed without public housing funds but will receive operating subsidy, or will be developed with public housing funds but will not receive operating subsidy.

      (2)  Operating Subsidy-Only Development refers to mixed-finance projects where public housing units are developed without the use of public housing funds, but for which HUD agrees to provide operating subsidies under Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act. These types of project are subject to the following provisions:

      (i) The newly developed public housing units will be included in the calculation of the Capital Fund formula in § 905.400 of this part.

      (ii) An ACC Amendment will be executed to include the new public housing units. The term of the ACC Amendment will be determined based on the assistance as provided in § 905.304, unless reduced by the Secretary.

      (iii) There shall be no disposition of the public housing units without the prior written approval of HUD, during, and for 10 years after the end of, the period in which the public housing units receive operating subsidy from the PHA, as required by 42 U.S.C. 1437g(3), as those requirements may be amended from time to time. However, if the PHA is no longer able to provide operating subsidies to the Owner Entity pursuant to Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act, the PHA may (on behalf of the Owner Entity) request that HUD terminate the Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, as applicable. Termination under this section does not require disposition approval from HUD pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437p. However, the PHA must provide public housing residents with a decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable unit to which they can relocate, which may include a public housing unit in another development or a Housing Choice Voucher, and pay for the tenant's reasonable moving costs. The URA is not applicable in this situation.

      (iv) Where the PHA elects in the future to use public housing funds for modernization of these units, the PHA must execute an ACC Amendment with a 20-year use restriction and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, in accordance with § 905.304. There may be no disposition of the public housing units without the prior written approval of HUD during the 20-year period, and the public housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as those requirements may be amended from time to time.

      (3)  Capital Fund-Only projects refers to mixed-finance projects where a PHA and its partners may develop public housing units using public housing funds for development of new units, but for which HUD will not be providing operating subsidy under Section 9(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e). These types of projects are subject to the following provisions:

      (i) The newly developed public housing units will not be included in the calculation of the Operating Fund formula.

      (ii) The PHA must sign an ACC Amendment, with a 40-year use restriction, for development of new units and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants in accordance with § 905.304 of this part, unless the time period is reduced by the Secretary.

      (iii) There shall be no disposition of the public housing units, without the prior written approval of HUD, during a 40-year period, and the public housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as required by section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3), as those requirements may be amended from time to time.

      (4)  PHAs must follow the development approval process identified in § 905.600.

      (k)  (1)  If a PHA enters into a contract with an entity that owns or operates a mixed-finance project, and the terms of the contract obligate the entity to operate and maintain a specified number of units in the project as public housing units, the contract may include terms that allow the Owner Entity to deviate from otherwise applicable Public Housing Requirements regarding rents, income eligibility, and other areas of public housing management with respect to all or a portion of the public housing units, subject to the following conditions:

      (i) There are a significant number of units in the mixed-finance project that are not public housing units;

      (ii) There is a reduction in appropriations under Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act (see 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e)) or a change in applicable law that results in the PHA being unable to fulfill its contractual obligation to the Owner Entity with respect to the public housing units;

      (iii) Prior to implementation of the contractual terms related to deviation from the Public Housing Requirements, HUD approves an Alternative Management Plan for the mixed-finance project; and

      (iv) The deviation shall be to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of those units while maintaining the low-income character of the units to the maximum extent practicable.

      (2)  Should the PHA and the Owner Entity determine a need to deviate from the Public Housing Requirements, the PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must submit an Alternative Management Plan to HUD for review and approval prior to implementation of any changes. The Plan must include the following:

      (i) A statement describing the Owner Entity's reasons for deviating from the Public Housing Requirements;

      (ii) An explanation of the Owner Entity's proposed remedies, including, but not limited to:

      (A) How the Owner Entity will select the residents (including the number and income levels of the families proposed to be admitted to the public housing units) and units to be affected by the proposed change;

      (B) The Owner Entity's timetable for implementing the Alternative Management Plan;

      (C) The impact on existing residents. Note that for any resident who is unable to remain in the unit as a result of implementation of the Alternative Management Plan, the resident must be relocated to a public housing unit or given a Housing Choice Voucher by the PHA or by another entity as provided for in the contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity;

      (iii) An amendment to the existing contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity that includes provisions which ensure that:

      (A) An update on the Alternative Management Plan is submitted annually to HUD to ensure that implementation of the provisions of the Alternative Management Plan continue to be appropriate;

      (B) The Owner Entity complies with the requirements of this subpart in its management and operation of the public housing units in accordance with the Alternative Management Plan;

      (C) The Owner Entity provides the PHA any income that is generated by the public housing units in excess of the Owner Entity's expenses on behalf of those units, as a result of implementation of provisions in the Alternative Management Plan;

      (D) The Owner Entity reinstates all Public Housing Requirements (including rent and income eligibility requirements) with respect to the original number of public housing units and number of bedrooms in the mixed-finance development, following the PHA's reinstatement of operating subsidies at the level originally agreed to in its contract with the Owner Entity; and

      (iv) Additional evidence. The PHA must provide documentation that:

      (A) The Owner Entity has provided copies of the Alternative Management Plan to residents of the project and provided the opportunity for review and comment prior to submission to HUD. The Owner Entity must have provided written notice to each of the public housing residents in the mixed-finance development of its intention to implement the Alternative Management Plan. Such notice must comply with all relevant federal, state, and local substantive and procedural requirements and, at a minimum, provide public housing residents 90 days advance notice of any proposal to increase rents or to relocate public housing residents to alternative housing;

      (B) The revenues being generated by the public housing units (in combination with the reduced allocation of Operating Subsidy resulting primarily from a reduction in appropriations or changes in applicable law such that the PHA is unable to comply with its contractual obligations to the Owner Entity) are inadequate to cover the reasonable and necessary operating expenses of the public housing units. Documentation should include a financial statement showing actual operating expenses and revenues over the past 5 years and the projected expenses and revenues over the next 10 years;

      (C) A demonstration that the PHA cannot meet its contractual obligation, and;

      (D) The Owner Entity has attempted to offset with regard to the project, the impact of reduced operating subsidies or changes in applicable law by all available means; including the use of other public and private development resources, the use of cash flow from any nonpublic housing units, and funds from other operating deficient reserves.

      (3)  HUD will review the Alternative Management Plan to ensure that the plan meets the requirements of this subpart and that any proposed deviation from the Public Housing Requirements will be implemented only to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of the public housing units. Upon completion of HUD's review, HUD will either approve or disapprove the Alternative Management Plan. Reasons for HUD disapproval may include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (i) The justification for deviation from the Public Housing Requirements does not qualify in accordance with section 35(h) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-7(h)).

      (ii) The proposed deviation(s) from the Public Housing Requirements are not limited to preserving the viability of the public housing units.

      (iii) The information that HUD requires to be included in the Alternative Management Plan has not been included, is not accurate, or does not support the need for deviation from the Public Housing Requirements.

      (iv) HUD has evidence that the proposed Alternative Management Plan is not in compliance with other federal requirements, including civil rights laws.

      (4)  The PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must provide to HUD, for HUD approval, an annual update on the implementation of the Alternative Management Plan. The update must provide the status of the project and whether the circumstances originally triggering the need for the conditions contained in the Alternative Management Plan remain valid and appropriate. Any proposed changes in the Alternative Management Plan should also be identified. Once the annual update of the Alternative Management Plan is properly submitted, the existing Alternative Management Plan shall remain in effect until such time as HUD takes additional action to approve or disapprove the annual update.

      § 905.606   Development proposal.

#### § § 905.606

      (a)  Prior to developing public housing, either through new construction or through acquisition, with or without rehabilitation, a PHA must submit a development proposal to HUD in the form prescribed by HUD, which will allow HUD to assess the viability and financial feasibility of the proposed development. A development proposal must be submitted for all types of public housing development, including mixed-finance. Failure to submit and obtain HUD approval of a development proposal may result in the public housing funds used in conjunction with the project being deemed ineligible expenses. In determining the amount of information to be submitted by the PHA, HUD shall consider whether the documentation is required for HUD to carry out mandatory statutory, regulatory, or Executive order reviews; the quality of the PHA's past performance in implementing development projects under this subpart; the PHA's demonstrated administrative capability; and other program requirements. The development proposal shall include some or all of the following documentation, as deemed necessary by HUD.

      (1)  A description of the proposed project, including:

      (i) Proposed development method (e.g., mixed-finance, new construction, acquisition with or without rehabilitation, turnkey, etc.), including the extent to which the PHA will use force account labor and use procured contractors. For new construction projects, the PHA must meet the program requirements contained in § 905.602. For projects involving acquisition of existing properties less than 2 years old, the PHA must include an attestation from the PHA and the owner of the property that the property was not constructed with the intent that it would be sold to the PHA or, if it was constructed with the intent that it be sold to the PHA, that it was constructed in compliance with all applicable requirements (e.g., Davis Bacon wage rates, accessibility, etc.);

      (ii) Type of residents to occupy the units (e.g., family, elderly, persons with disabilities, or families that include persons with disabilities);

      (iii) Number and type of unit (detached, semidetached, row house, walkup, elevator), with bedroom count, broken out by public housing vs. nonpublic housing, if applicable;

      (iv) The type and size of nondwelling space, if applicable; and

      (v) Schematic drawings of the proposed buildings, unit plans, and additional information regarding plans and specifications, as needed by HUD to review the project.

      (2)  An identification and description of the proposed site and neighborhood, a site plan, and a map of the neighborhood.

      (3)  Identification of participating parties and a description of the activities to be undertaken by each of the participating parties and the PHA; and the legal and business relationships between the PHA and each of the participating parties, as applicable.

      (4)  A schedule for the development project that includes each major stage of development, through and including the submission of an Actual Development Cost Certificate to HUD.

      (5)  A PHA must provide sufficient information for HUD to determine that dwelling units and other public housing facilities meet accessibility requirements specified at § 905.312 of this part, including, but not limited to, the number, location, and bedroom size distribution of accessible dwelling units (see 24 CFR 8.32 and 24 CFR part 40).

      (6)  (i)  To allow HUD to assess sources of funding and projected uses of funds, the PHA shall submit a project budget, in the form prescribed by HUD, reflecting the total permanent development budget for the project, including all sources and uses of funds, including hard and soft costs. The PHA shall also submit a budget for the construction period and a construction draw schedule showing the timing of construction financing contributions and disbursements. In addition, the PHA shall submit an independent construction cost estimate or actual construction contract that supports the permanent and construction budgets.

      (ii)  The PHA must submit a calculation of the TDC and HCC, subject to § 905.314 of this part.

      (iii)  A PHA must submit a detailed description of all financing necessary for the implementation of the project, specifying the sources and uses. In addition, HUD may require documents related to the financing (e.g., loan documents, partnership or operating agreement, regulatory and operating agreement, etc.) to be submitted in final draft form as part of the development proposal. Upon financial closing, HUD may also require final, executed copies of these documents to be submitted to HUD for final approval, per § 905.612(b)(2) of this part.

      (A)  Documents submitted pursuant to this section must irrevocably commit funds to the project. Irrevocability of funds means that binding legal documents—such as loan agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, partnership agreements or operating agreements, or similar documents committing funds—have been executed by the applicable parties; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/or other conditions generally consistent with similar non-public housing transactions. For projects involving revolving loan funds, the irrevocability of funds means that funds in an amount identified to HUD as the maximum revolving loan have been committed pursuant to legally binding documents; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/or other conditions generally consistent with similar affordable housing transactions. The PHA must confirm the availability of each party's financing, the amount and source of financing committed to the proposal by the parties, and the irrevocability of those funds.

      (B)  To ensure the irrevocable nature of the committed funds, the PHA shall review the legal documents committing such funds to ensure that the progress milestones and conditions precedent contained in such contracts are generally consistent with similar affordable housing transactions; that the PHA and/or its Owner Entity know of no impediments that would prevent the project from moving forward consistent with the project milestones and conditions precedent; and, after conducting sufficient due diligence, that such documents are properly executed by persons or entities legally authorized to bind the entity committing such funds.

      (C)  The PHA is not required to ensure the availability of funds by enforcing documents to which it is not a party.

      (D)  As part of the proposal, the PHA may certify as to the irrevocability of funds through the submission of an opinion of the PHA's counsel attesting that counsel has examined the availability of the participating parties' financing, and the amount and source of financing committed to the project by the participating parties, and has determined that such financing has been irrevocably committed, as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, and that such commitments are consistent with the project budget submitted under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.

      (7)  To allow HUD to assess the financial feasibility of projects, PHAs shall submit a 10-year operating pro-forma, including all assumptions, to assure that operating expenses do not exceed operating income. For mixed-finance development, the PHA must describe its methodology for providing and distributing operating subsidy to the Owner Entity for the public housing units.

      (8)  A PHA may elect to exempt all public housing units in a mixed-finance project from the payment in lieu of taxes provisions under section 6(d) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(d), and from the finding of need and cooperative agreement provisions under sections 5(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437c(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2), and instead subject units to local real estate taxes, but only if the PHA provides documentation from an authorized official of the local jurisdiction that development of the units is consistent with the jurisdiction's comprehensive housing affordability strategy. If the PHA does not elect this exemption, the Cooperation Agreement as provided in § 905.602(a) is required and must be submitted.

      (9)  The PHA must provide an approved Request for Release of Funds and environmental certification, submitted in accordance with 24 CFR part 58, or approval in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. HUD will not approve a development proposal without the appropriate environmental approval.

      (10)  For a mixed-finance development that includes nonpublic housing units, the PHA must include an analysis of the projected market for the proposed project.

      (11)  The PHA must provide information identifying fees to be paid to the PHA, the PHA's partner(s), the Owner Entity, and/or other participating parties identified by HUD and on the receipt and use of program income.

      (b)  PHAs are required to provide any additional information that HUD may need to assess the development proposal.

      § 905.608   Site acquisition proposal.

#### § § 905.608

      (a)  When a PHA determines that it is necessary to acquire vacant land for development of public housing through new construction, using public housing funds, prior to submission and approval of a development proposal under § 905.606 of this part, the PHA must submit an acquisition proposal to HUD for review and approval prior to acquisition. The acquisition proposal shall include the following:

      (b)  A justification for acquiring property prior to development proposal submission and approval.

      (c)  A description of the property (, the proposed site and/or project) to be acquired.

      (d)  An identification and description of the proposed project, site plan, and neighborhood, together with information sufficient to enable HUD to determine that the proposed site meets the site and neighborhood standards at § 905.602(d) of this part.

      (e)  Documentation that the proposed project is permitted by current zoning ordinances or regulations, or evidence to indicate that needed rezoning is likely and will not delay the project.

      (f)  Documentation attesting that an appraisal of the proposed property by an independent, state certified appraiser has been conducted and that the acquisition is in compliance with § 905.308(b)(9) of this part. The purchase price of the site/property may not exceed the appraised value without HUD approval.

      (g)  A schedule of the activities to be carried out by the PHA.

      (h)  An environmental review or request for HUD to perform the environmental review pursuant to § 905.308(b)(2) of this part.

      § 905.610   Technical processing.

#### § § 905.610

      (a)  HUD shall review all development proposals and site acquisition proposals for compliance with the statutory, Executive order, and regulatory requirements applicable to the development of public housing and the project. HUD's review will evaluate whether the proposed sources and uses of funds are eligible and reasonable, and whether the financing and other documentation establish to HUD's satisfaction that the development is financially viable and structured so as to adequately protect the federal investment of funds in the development. For this purpose, HUD will consider the PHA's proposed methodology for allocating operating subsidies on behalf of the public housing units, the projected revenue to be generated by any nonpublic housing units in a mixed-finance development, and the 10-year operating pro forma and other information contained in the development proposal.

      (b)  After the PHA submits the documentation required under paragraph (a) of this section, HUD or its designee (e.g., the State Housing Finance Agency) shall carry out a subsidy layering analysis, pursuant to section 102(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) (see 24 CFR part 4), to determine that the amount of assistance being provided for the development is not more than necessary to make the assisted activity feasible after taking into account the other governmental assistance.

      (c)  For mixed-finance projects, in order to expedite the mixed-finance review process and control costs, HUD may make available safe harbor and maximum fee ranges for a number of costs. If a project is at or below a safe harbor standard, no further review will be required by HUD. If a project is above a safe harbor standard, additional review by HUD will be necessary. In order to approve terms above the safe harbor, the PHA must demonstrate to HUD in writing that the negotiated terms are appropriate for the level of risk involved in the project, the scope of work, any specific circumstances of the development, and the local or national market for the services provided.

      (d)  If HUD determines that a site acquisition proposal or a development proposal is approvable, HUD shall notify the PHA in writing of its approval. The HUD approval of a development proposal will include the appropriate form of ACC for signature. The PHA must execute the ACC and return it to HUD for execution. Until HUD approves a development proposal, a PHA may only expend public housing funds for predevelopment costs, as provided in § 905.612 of this part.

      (e)  HUD must approve any material change to an approved development proposal. HUD defines material change as:

      (1) A change in the number of public housing units;

      (2) A change in the number of bedrooms by an increase/decrease of more than 10 percent;

      (3) A change in cost or financing by an increase/decrease of more than 10 percent; or

      (4) A change in the site.

      § 905.612   Disbursement of Capital Funds—predevelopment costs.

#### § § 905.612

      (a)  After a new development project has been included in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan that has been approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, a PHA may use funding for predevelopment expenses. Predevelopment funds may be expended in accordance with the following requirements:

      (1) Predevelopment assistance may be used to pay for materials and services related to proposal development and project soft costs. It may also be used to pay for costs related to the demolition of units on a proposed site. Absent HUD approval, predevelopment assistance may not be used to pay for site work, installation of infrastructure, construction, or other hard costs related to a development.

      (2) For non-mixed-finance projects, predevelopment funding up to 5 percent of the total amount of the public housing funds committed to a project does not require HUD approval. HUD shall determine on a case-by-case basis that an amount greater than 5 percent may be drawn down by a PHA to pay for necessary and reasonable predevelopment costs, based upon a consideration of the nature and scope of activities proposed to be carried out by the PHA. Before a request for predevelopment assistance in excess of 5 percent may be approved, the PHA must provide to HUD information and documentation specified in §§ 905.606 and 905.608 of this part, as HUD deems appropriate.

      (3) For mixed-finance projects, all funding for predevelopment costs must be reviewed and approved by HUD prior to expenditure.

      (4) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section to disburse funds for mixed-financed projects in an approved ratio to other public and private funding do not apply to disbursement of predevelopment funds.

      (b)  (1)  If HUD determines that the proposed development is approvable, it may execute with the PHA the applicable ACC Amendment to provide funds for the purposes and in the amounts approved by HUD. Upon approval of the development proposal and all necessary documentation evidencing and implementing the development plan, the PHA may disburse amounts as are necessary and consistent with the approved development proposal without further HUD approval, unless HUD determines that such approval is necessary. Once HUD approves the site acquisition proposal, the PHA may request funds for acquisition activities. Each Capital Fund disbursement from HUD is deemed to be an attestation of compliance by the PHA with the requirements of this part, as prescribed in § 905.106 of this part. If HUD determines that the PHA is in noncompliance with any provision of this part, the PHA may be subject to the sanctions in § 905.800, subpart H, of this part.

      (2)  For mixed-finance projects, prior to PHA disbursement of public housing funds, except predevelopment funds identified in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD may require a PHA to submit to HUD, for review and approval, copies of final, fully executed, and, where appropriate, recorded documents, submitted as part of the development proposal process. Upon completion of the project, the ratio of public housing funds to non-public housing funds for the overall project must remain as reflected in the executed documents. The ratio does not apply during the construction period.

      § 905.700   Other security interests.

#### § § 905.700

      (a) The PHA may not pledge, mortgage, enter into a transaction that provides recourse to public housing assets, or otherwise grant a security interest in any public housing project, portion thereof, or other property of the PHA without the written approval of HUD.

      (b) The PHA shall submit the request in the form and manner prescribed by HUD.

      (c) HUD shall consider:

      (1) The ability of the PHA to complete the financing, the improvements, and repay the financing;

      (2) The reasonableness of the provisions in the proposal; or

      (3) Any other factors HUD deems appropriate.

#### § § 905.800

      As provided in § 905.106 of this part, PHAs or other owner/management entities and their partners are required to comply with all applicable provisions of this part. Execution of the CF ACC Amendment received from the PHA, submissions required by this part, and disbursement of Capital Fund grants from HUD are individually and collectively deemed to be the PHA's certification that it is in compliance with the provisions of this part and all other Public Housing Program Requirements. Noncompliance with any provision of this part or other applicable requirements may subject the PHA and/or its partners to sanctions contained in § 905.804 of this part.

      § 905.802   HUD review of PHA performance.

#### § § 905.802

      (a)  HUD shall review the PHA's performance in completing work in accordance with this part. HUD may make such other reviews when and as it determines necessary. When conducting such a review, HUD shall, at minimum, make the following determinations:

      (1) HUD shall determine whether the PHA has carried out its activities under this part in a timely manner and in accordance with its CFP 5-Year Action Plan and other applicable requirements.

      (2) HUD shall determine whether the PHA has a continuing capacity to carry out its Capital Fund activities in a timely manner.

      (3) HUD shall determine whether the PHA has accurately reported its obligation and expenditures in a timely manner.

      (4) HUD shall determine whether the PHA has accurately reported required building and unit data for the calculation of the formula.

      (5) HUD shall determine whether the PHA has obtained approval for any CFFP or OFFP proposal and any PHA development proposal.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 905.804   Sanctions.

#### § § 905.804

      (a) If at any time, HUD finds that a PHA has failed to comply substantially with any provision this part, HUD may impose one or a combination of sanctions, as it determines is necessary. Sanctions associated with failure to obligate or expend in a timely manner are specified at § 905.306 of this part. Other possible sanctions that HUD may impose for noncompliance by the PHA include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (1) Issue a corrective action order, at any time, by notifying the PHA of the specific program requirements that the PHA has violated, and specifying that any of the corrective actions listed in this section must be taken. Any corrective action ordered by HUD shall become a condition of the CF ACC Amendment.

      (2) Require reimbursement from non-HUD sources.

      (3) Limit, withhold, reduce, or terminate Capital Fund or Operating Fund assistance.

      (4) Issue a Limited Denial of Participation or Debar responsible PHA officials, pursuant to 2 CFR parts 180 and 2424.

      (5) Withhold assistance to the PHA under section 8 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437f.

      (6) Declare a breach of the CF ACC with respect to some or all of the PHA's functions.

      (7) Take any other available corrective action or sanction as HUD deems necessary.

      (b)  Before taking any action described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall notify the PHA of its finding and proposed action and provide to the PHA an opportunity, within a prescribed period of time, to present any arguments or additional facts and data concerning the finding and proposed action to HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 1172, Mar. 11, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 906.1   Purpose.

#### § § 906.1

      (a) This part states the requirements and procedures governing public housing homeownership programs involving sales of individual dwelling units to families or to purchase and resale entities (PREs) for resale to families carried out by public housing agencies (PHAs), as authorized by section 32 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-4) (1937 Act). A PHA may only transfer public housing units for homeownership under a homeownership program approved by HUD under this part, except as provided under § 906.3. This section does not govern new construction or substantial rehabilitation of units sold under this part. Such construction or rehabilitation is governed by the public housing development and modernization regulations.

      (b) Under a public housing homeownership program, a PHA makes available for purchase by low-income families for use as their principal residences public housing dwelling units, public housing developments, and other housing units or developments owned, assisted, or operated, or otherwise acquired by the PHA for sale under a homeownership program in connection with the use of assistance provided under the 1937 Act (1937 Act funds). A PHA may sell all or a portion of a property for purposes of homeownership in accordance with a HUD-approved homeownership program, and in accordance with the PHA's annual plan under part 903 of this title.

      § 906.2   Definitions.

#### § § 906.2

      (ACC) is defined in 24 CFR 5.403.

      is defined in the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2).

      means a housing unit that does not receive assistance under the 1937 Act (other than Section 8 assistance).

      means the 5-year or annual plan required under section 5A of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437c-1, and its implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 903.

      means an entity that acquires units for resale to low-income families in accordance with this part.

      § 906.3   Requirements applicable to homeownership programs previously approved by HUD.

#### § § 906.3

      (a) Any existing section 5(h) or Turnkey III homeownership program continues to be governed by the requirements of part 906 or part 904 of this title, respectively, contained in the April 1, 2002, edition of 24 CFR, parts 700 to 1699. The use of other program income for homeownership activities continues to be governed by agreements executed with HUD.

      (b) A PHA may convert an existing homeownership program, or a specific number of the units in such a program, to a homeownership program under this part with HUD approval.

    Subpart B—Basic Program Requirements

      § 906.5   Dwelling units and types of assistance that a PHA may make available under a homeownership program under this part.

#### § § 906.5

      (a) A homeownership program under this part may provide for sale of:

      (1) Units that are public housing units; and

      (2) Other units owned, operated, assisted, or acquired for homeownership sale and that have received the benefit of 1937 Act funds or are to be sold with the benefit of 1937 Act funds (non-public housing units). In selecting such units to be sold in a homeownership program under this part, the PHA shall not select units such that it could not comply with § 906.7(a).

      (b) A homeownership program under this part may provide for financing to eligible families ( § 905.15 of this title) purchasing dwelling units eligible under paragraph (a) of this section under the program, or for acquisition of housing units or developments by the PHA for sale under the program.

      (1) Under this part, a PHA may use assistance from amounts it receives under the Capital Fund under section 9(d) of the 1937 Act or from other income earned from its 1937 Act programs to provide assistance to public housing residents only to facilitate the purchase of homes ( counseling, closing costs, that portion of the down payment not required to be supplied from the purchaser's funds under the provisions of § 906.15(c), financing, and moving assistance). Public housing residents may use such assistance to purchase the unit in which they reside, another public housing unit, or a residence not located in a public housing development.

      (2) A PHA may provide financing assistance for other eligible purchasers from other income,  funds not from 1937 Act programs, such as proceeds from selling public housing units, loan repayments, and public housing debt forgiveness funding not already committed to another purpose.

      (3) In accordance with the rules and regulations governing the Section 8(y) Homeownership Option, found in 24 CFR part 982 subpart M, a PHA may make its housing choice voucher funds available to provide assistance to a family purchasing a unit under this part. A family receiving assistance under the Section 8(y) program and participating in a homeownership program under this part must meet the requirements of both programs.

      (c) A PHA must not use 1937 Act funds to rehabilitate units that are not public housing units.

      § 906.7   Physical requirements that a property offered for sale under this part must meet.

#### § § 906.7

      (a)  A property offered for sale under a homeownership program must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982) and the relevant requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, L, and R of this title. When a prospective purchaser who has known disabilities, or who has a family member with known disabilities requires accessible features, the features must be added as a reasonable accommodation to the disability, in accordance with the requirements of § 8.29 of this title. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. These standards must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser.

      (b) A unit in this program for which the purchasing family is receiving assistance under Section 8(y) must be an eligible unit for purposes of the Homeownership Option under 24 CFR part 982, subpart M.

      § 906.9   Title restrictions and encumbrances on properties sold under a homeownership program.

#### § § 906.9

      (a) If the property is subject to indebtedness under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC), HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated under the ACC, and the property sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness.

      (b) Upon sale of a public housing unit to a public housing tenant or eligible family, or to a PRE operating the units as non-public housing, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership program, HUD will execute a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale, it will cease to be eligible for public housing Operating Fund or Capital Fund payments.

    Subpart C—Purchaser Requirements

      § 906.11   Eligible purchasers.

#### § § 906.11

      Entities that purchase units from the PHA for resale to low-income families (purchase and resale entities or PREs) and low-income families are eligible to purchase properties made available for sale under a PHA homeownership program.

      § 906.13   Right of first refusal.

#### § § 906.13

      (a) In selling a public housing unit under a homeownership program, the PHA or PRE must initially offer the unit to the resident occupying the unit, if any, notwithstanding the requirements of §§ 906.15(a) and 906.15(c).

      (b) This program does not require the PHA, when selling a unit that is a non-public housing unit, to offer the unit for sale first to the current resident of the unit.

      § 906.15   Requirements applicable to a family purchasing a property under a homeownership program.

#### § § 906.15

      (a)  Except in the case of a PHA's offer of first refusal to a resident occupying the unit under § 906.13, a family purchasing a property under a PHA homeownership program must be a low-income family, as defined in section 3 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a), at the time the contract to purchase the property is executed.

      (b)  The dwelling unit sold to an eligible family must be used as the principal residence of the family.

      (c)  Eligibility must be limited to families who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership, under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A homeownership program may, however, take account of any available subsidy from other sources. Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements:

      (1)  On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, and other regularly recurring homeownership costs (such as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of:

      (i) 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR part 913; and

      (ii) Any subsidy that will be available for such payments;

      (2)  Each family purchasing housing under a homeownership program must provide a down payment in connection with any loan for acquisition of the housing, in an amount determined by the PHA or PRE, in accordance with an approved homeownership program. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the PHA or PRE must permit the family to use grant amounts, gifts from relatives, contributions from private sources, and other similar amounts in making the down payment;

      (3) The family must use its own resources other than grants, gifts, contributions, or similar amounts, to contribute an amount of the down payment that is not less than one percent of the purchase price of the housing. The PHA or PRE must maintain records that are verifiable by HUD through audits regarding the source of this one percent contribution.

      (d)  A PHA may establish requirements or limitations for families to purchase housing under a homeownership program, including but not limited to requirements or limitations regarding:

      (1) Employment or participation in employment counseling or training activities;

      (2) Criminal activity;

      (3) Participation in homeownership counseling programs; and

      (4) Evidence of regular income.

      § 906.17   PHA handling of homeownership applications.

#### § § 906.17

      Families who are interested in purchasing a unit must submit applications to the PHA or PRE for that specific purpose, and those applications must be handled separately from applications for other PHA programs. Application for homeownership must not affect an applicant's place on any other PHA waiting list for rental units.

      § 906.19   Requirements applicable to a purchase and resale entity (PRE).

#### § § 906.19

      (a)  In the case of a purchase of units for resale to low-income families by a PRE, the PHA must have an approved homeownership program that describes the use of a PRE to sell the units to low-income families within 5 years from the date of the PRE's acquisition of the units.

      (b)  The PHA must demonstrate in its homeownership program that the PRE has the necessary legal capacity and administrative capability to carry out its responsibilities under the program. The PHA's homeownership program also must contain a written agreement (not required to be submitted as part of the homeownership plan) that specifies the respective rights and obligations of the PHA and the PRE, and which includes:

      (1) Assurances that the PRE will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership program;

      (2) Assurances that the PRE will be subject to a title restriction providing that the property must be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to eligible families, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership program, or by reconveyance to the PHA, and that the property will not be encumbered by the PRE without the written consent of the PHA;

      (3) Protection against fraud or misuse of funds or other property on the part of the PRE, its employees, and agents;

      (4) Assurances that the resale proceeds will be used only for the purposes specified by the HUD-approved homeownership program;

      (5) Limitation of the PRE's administrative and overhead costs, and of any compensation or profit that may be realized by the PRE, to amounts that are reasonable in relation to its responsibilities and risks;

      (6) Accountability to the PHA and residents for the recordkeeping, reporting, and audit requirements of § 906.33;

      (7) Assurances that the PRE will administer its responsibilities under the plan on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act, its implementing regulations, and other applicable civil rights statutes and authorities, including the authorities cited in § 5.105(a) of this title; and

      (8) Adequate legal remedies for the PHA and residents, in the event of the PRE's failure to perform in accordance with the agreement.

      (c)  The requirement for a PRE to sell units under a homeownership program only to low-income families must be recorded as a deed restriction at the time of purchase by the PRE.

      (d)  A PRE must agree that, with respect to any units it acquires under a homeownership program under this part, it will transfer ownership to the PHA if the PRE fails to resell the unit to a low-income family within 5 years of the PRE's acquisition of the unit.

    Subpart D—Program Administration

      § 906.23   Protections available to non-purchasing public housing residents.

#### § § 906.23

      (a) If a public housing resident does not exercise the right of first refusal under § 906.13, and the PHA determines to move the tenant for the purpose of transferring possession of the unit, the PHA must provide the notice stated in this section 90 days before the date the resident is displaced, and may not displace the resident, except as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the full 90-day period. The PHA:

      (1) Must notify the resident residing in the unit 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health or safety, that:

      (i) The public housing unit will be sold;

      (ii) The transfer of possession of the unit will not occur until the resident is relocated; and

      (iii) Each resident displaced by such action will be offered comparable housing (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section);

      (2) Must provide for the payment of the actual costs and reasonable relocation expenses of the resident to be displaced;

      (3) Must ensure that the resident is offered comparable housing under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section;

      (4) Must provide counseling for displaced residents regarding their rights to comparable housing, including their rights under the Fair Housing Act to choice of a unit on a nondiscriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, disability, age, sex, or familial status; and

      (5) Must not transfer possession of the unit until the resident is relocated.

      (b) For purposes of this section, the term “comparable housing” means housing:

      (1) That meets housing quality standards;

      (2) That is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the displaced resident's original development; and

      (3) Which may include:

      (i) Tenant-based assistance (tenant-based assistance must only be provided upon the relocation of the resident to the comparable housing);

      (ii) Project-based assistance; or

      (iii) Occupancy in a unit owned, operated, or assisted by the PHA at a rental rate paid by the resident that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the resident is vacating.

      § 906.24   Protections available to non-purchasing residents of housing other than public housing.

#### § § 906.24

      Residents of non-public housing that would be displaced by a homeownership program are eligible for assistance under the Uniform Relocation Act and part 42 of this title. For purposes of this part, a family that was over-income ( an individual or family that is not a low-income family) at the time of initial occupancy of public housing and was admitted in accordance with section 3(a)(5) of the 1937 Act, is treated as a non-purchasing resident of non-public housing.

      § 906.25   Ownership interests that may be conveyed to a purchaser.

#### § § 906.25

      A homeownership program may provide for sale to the purchasing family of any ownership interest that the PHA considers appropriate under the homeownership program, including but not limited to:

      (a) Ownership in fee simple;

      (b) A condominium interest;

      (c) An interest in a limited dividend cooperative;

      (d) A shared appreciation interest with a PHA providing financing; or

      (e) A leasehold under a bona fide lease-purchase arrangement.

      § 906.27   Limitations applicable to net proceeds on the sale of a property acquired through a homeownership program.

#### § § 906.27

      (a) Where the family has owned a unit under this part, the following rules apply:

      (1) In this section, the term  means the financial gain on resale attributable solely to the home's appreciation in value over time, and not attributable to government-provided assistance or any below-market financing provided under § 906.29.

      (2) In this section, the term  means the financial gain on resale received by the seller after satisfying all amounts owing under mortgages, paying closing costs, and receiving an amount equal to the down payment (made from the seller's own funds) and principal payments on the mortgage(s).

      (3) A PHA must have a policy that provides for the recapture of net proceeds in an amount that the PHA considers appropriate under the guidelines in this section.

      (4) A PHA must have a policy that provides the recapture of the following amounts, if a family resells a homeownership unit it purchased under this part during the 5-year period beginning upon purchase of the dwelling unit:

      (i) All or a portion of the gain from appreciation; and

      (ii) All or a portion of the assistance provided (which includes below-market financing, but which does not include Section 8(y) assistance used for mortgage payments under this part) under the homeownership program to the family to the extent there are net proceeds, considering the factors the PHA establishes under paragraphs (b)(1)-(7) of this section.

      (b) The PHA's program under this part may provide for consideration of any factors the PHA considers appropriate in determining how much of the gain from appreciation and assistance to recapture, including but not limited to the following:

      (1) The aggregate amount of assistance provided under the homeownership program to the family;

      (2) The contribution of equity by the purchasing family;

      (3) The period of time elapsed between purchase by the homebuyer under the homeownership program and resale by the homebuyer;

      (4) The reason for resale;

      (5) Any improvements made by the family purchasing under the homeownership program;

      (6) Any appreciation in the value of the property; and

      (7) Any other factors that the PHA considers appropriate in making the recapture determination under this section.

      (c) After the expiration of the 5-year period in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the PHA must recapture all or a portion of the assistance provided under the homeownership program to the family to the extent there are net proceeds.

      (d) The PHA must enforce its recapture policy through an appropriate form of title restriction.

      § 906.29   Below-Market sales and financing.

#### § § 906.29

      A homeownership plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing to enable below-market purchases, or a combination of the two. Discounted purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's ability to pay, or may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method ( uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings, within a range of affordability by potential purchases). Below-market financing may include any lawful type of public or private financing, including but not limited to purchase-money mortgages, non-cash second mortgages, promissory notes, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared equity, or lease-purchase arrangements.

      § 906.31   Requirements applicable to net proceeds resulting from sale.

#### § § 906.31

      (a)  The PHA must use any net proceeds of any sales under a homeownership program remaining after payment of all costs of the sale for purposes relating to low-income housing and in accordance with its PHA plan.

      (b)  The PHA may require the PRE to return the net proceeds from the resale of the units to the PHA. If the PHA permits the PRE to retain the net proceeds, the PRE must use these proceeds for low-income housing purposes.

      (c)  In a situation where the PRE fails to sell a unit to an eligible family within 5 years, and the provision of § 906.19(d) requiring that the unit be transferred to the PHA applies:

      (1) If the unit has not been operated by the PRE as a public housing unit at any time during the 5-year period, the PHA may resell the unit in accordance with this part or any successor homeownership program of the department, or apply to have the unit included in its public housing program, if it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements of the public housing program; or

      (2) If the unit has been operated by the PRE as a public housing unit within such a 5-year period, the PHA must return the unit to operation in its regular public housing program.

      (d)  Where the PRE operates the unit as public housing during the 5-year interim period under § 960.40, and fails to sell the unit to an eligible family within such 5-year period and the provision of § 906.19(d) applies, the PHA must return the unit to operation in its regular public housing program.

      § 906.33   Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

#### § § 906.33

      The PHA is responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records) for all activities incident to implementation of the HUD-approved homeownership program. Where a PRE is responsible for the sale of units, the PHA must ensure that the PRE's responsibilities include proper recordkeeping and accountability to the PHA, sufficient to enable the PHA to monitor compliance with the approved homeownership program and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records must be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO). The PHA must report annually to HUD on the progress of each program approved under this part. The PHA must report as part of the Annual Plan process under § 903.7(k) of this title, except for those PHAs under §§ 903.11(c)(1) and (2) of this title who are not required to include information on their public housing homeownership programs in their Annual Plan. Those PHAs must report by providing a description of the homeownership program to HUD, including the cumulative number of units sold.

      § 906.35   Inapplicability of section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

#### § § 906.35

      The provisions of section 18 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p) do not apply to disposition of public housing dwelling units under a homeownership program approved by HUD under this part, or to the sale of a unit to a PRE to operate as public housing and sell to a low-income family within 5 years, under the requirements of § 906.19.

      § 906.37   Davis-Bacon and HUD wage rate requirements.

#### § § 906.37

      (a)  Wage rate requirements in accordance with § 968.110(e) of this title apply to the following activities:

      (1) Rehabilitation, repairs, and accessibility modifications performed under an agreement or contract with the PHA or by the PHA, pursuant to § 906.7. Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply as follows:

      (ii) Non-public housing units acquired by a PHA using Capital Funds that will be sold under a homeownership program: Davis-Bacon rates apply; and

      (iii) Non-public housing units owned or acquired by a PHA with the intent to use 1937 Act funds to finance the sale of the units, or otherwise provide assistance to purchasers of the units: Davis-Bacon rates apply;

      (2) New construction of non-public housing units pursuant to a contract for acquisition by a PHA for the purpose of sale under a homeownership program: Davis-Bacon rates apply;

      (3) Operation, rehabilitation, and repair of units operated as public housing units by a PRE: HUD rates apply to nonroutine maintenance, as defined in § 968.105 of this title, and routine maintenance. Davis-Bacon rates apply to rehabilitation and repair that does not qualify as nonroutine maintenance.

      (b)  All architects, technical engineers, draftsmen, and technicians employed in the development of units under a homeownership program shall be paid not less than the HUD-determined wage rates in accordance with § 968.100(f) of this title.

    Subpart E—Program Submission and Approval

      § 906.38   Requirement of HUD approval to implement a homeownership program under this part.

#### § § 906.38

      A PHA must obtain HUD approval before implementing a homeownership program under this part. A homeownership program under this part must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this part and the PHA Plan submitted under part 903 of this title.

      § 906.39   Contents of a homeownership program.

#### § § 906.39

      A homeownership program must include the following matters, as applicable to the particular factual situation:

      (a)  The PHA should indicate how units will be sold, including a description of the exact method of sale, such as, for example, fee simple conveyance, lease-purchase, or sale of a cooperative share. PHAs may sell units directly to a tenant or eligible family directly or via a  lease-purchase arrangement. The PHA must indicate whether it, or a PRE will sell units to families directly or via such lease-purchase method. If the PHA or PRE will use a lease-purchase method the proposal should indicate the terms of the lease-purchase arrangement. The terms of the lease-purchase arrangement shall include, but are not limited to the periodic documentation to be provided to the family regarding the amount they have accrued toward the down payment, and the length of the lease period (with regard to PREs the sales must be completed within the statutory 5-year period.);

      (b)  (1) If the program involves only financing assistance to the family purchasing the unit, the PHA need not specify property addresses, but it must describe the area(s) in which the assistance is to be used;

      (2) If the PHA is selling existing public housing, it must describe the property, including identification of the property by project number, or street address if there is no project number, and the specific dwellings to be sold, with bedroom distribution by size and type broken down by development;

      (3) If the PHA is acquiring units with 1937 Act funds to sell under the program, it must comply with the provisions of § 906.40 concerning this element of the program;

      (c)  If applicable, a plan for any repair or rehabilitation needed to meet the requirements of § 906.7, based on the assessment of the physical condition of the property that is included in the supporting documentation.

      (d)  The standards and procedures to be used for homeownership applications and the eligibility and selection of purchasers, consistent with the requirements of § 906.15. If the homeownership program allows application for purchase of units by families who are not presently public housing or Section 8 residents and not already on the PHA's waiting lists for those programs, the program must include an affirmative fair housing marketing strategy for such families, including specific steps to inform them of their eligibility to apply, and to solicit applications from those in the housing market who are least likely to apply for the program without special outreach, including persons with disabilities;

      (e)  Terms and conditions of sale and financing, including any below-market financing under § 906.29;

      (f)  A description of resident input obtained during the resident consultation process required by the PHA Plan under part 903 of this title. If the PHA is one whose Plan does not require information regarding homeownership under § 903.11(b)(1) of this title, the PHA must consult with the Resident Advisory Board or Boards regarding the homeownership plan, and provide the information required in this paragraph;

      (g)  Counseling, training, and technical assistance to be provided to purchasers;

      (h)  If the program contemplates sale to residents by an entity other than the PHA, a description of that entity's responsibilities and information demonstrating that the requirements of § 906.19 have been met or will be met in a timely fashion;

      (m)  An estimated timetable for the major steps required to carry out the program;

      (n)  A deed restriction or covenant running with the land that will assure to HUD's satisfaction that the requirements of §§ 906.27 and 906.15(b) are met.

      § 906.40   Supporting documentation.

#### § § 906.40

      The following supporting documentation must be submitted to HUD with the proposed homeownership program, as appropriate for the particular program:

      (a)  In approving homeownership programs in which the PHA contemplates selling public housing units to a PRE for operation as public housing during the 5 year interim period the department will require evidentiary materials including but not limited to:

      (1) Organizational documents of the PRE;

      (2) Regulatory and operating agreement between the PHA and PRE regarding the provision of operating subsidy and the operation of the public housing units in accordance with all applicable public housing requirements;

      (3) Management agreement and plan;

      (4) Financing documents, if any;

      (5) A description of the use of operating subsidy during the PRE's period of ownership, in the form of an operating pro forma;

      (6) A mixed-finance ACC amendment governing these units;

      (7) A deed restriction or covenant running with the land that will assure to HUD's satisfaction that the PRE will operate the units in accordance with public housing laws and regulations, including § 906.19.

      (8) A bond for repairs or proof of insurance to cover any damage to the property during the period of PRE ownership and operation;

      (9) Such other materials as may be required by HUD.

      (b)  An assessment of the physical condition of the properties, based on the standards specified in § 906.7;

      (c)  A statement demonstrating the practical feasibility of the program, based on analysis of data on such elements as purchase prices, costs of repair or rehabilitation, accessibility costs, if applicable, homeownership costs, family incomes, availability of financing, and the extent to which there are eligible residents who are expected to be interested in purchase ( § 906.45(a));

      (d)  A statement of the commitment and capability of the PHA (and any other entity with substantial responsibility for implementing the homeownership program) to successfully carry out the homeownership program. The statement must describe the PHA's (and other entity's) past experience in carrying out homeownership programs for low-income families, and (if applicable) its reasons for considering such programs to have been successful. A PHA that has not previously implemented a homeownership program for low-income families instead must submit a statement describing its experience in carrying out public housing modernization and development projects under part 905 of this title, respectively;

      (e)  The PHA's or PRE's certification that it will administer the plan on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11063, other authorities cited in § 5.105(a) of this title, and the implementing regulations, and will assure compliance with those requirements by any other entity that may assume substantial responsibilities for implementing the program;

      (f)  An opinion by legal counsel to the PHA, stating that counsel has reviewed the program and finds it consistent with all applicable requirements of federal, state, and local law, including regulations as well as statutes. At a minimum, the attorney must certify that the documents to be used will ensure sales only to eligible families under § 906.15, compliance with the 5-year PRE sale guarantee in § 906.19(d), and compliance with the restriction of use of resale proceeds of § 906.27;

      (g)  A resolution by the PHA's Board of Commissioners, evidencing its approval of the program;

      (h)  In any case where the PHA plans to provide families with assistance under the Section 8(y) homeownership option in connection with homeownership under this part, a certification that the PHA will comply with the requirements of the Section 8(y) statute and implementing regulations;

      (i)  Any other information that may reasonably be required for HUD review of the program. Except for the PHA-HUD implementing agreement under § 906.49 and the deed restriction required by § 906.39(n), HUD approval is not required for documents to be prepared and used by the PHA in implementing the program (such as contracts, applications, deeds, mortgages, promissory notes, and cooperative or condominium documents), if their essential terms and conditions are described in the program. Consequently, those documents need not be submitted as part of the program or the supporting documentation.

      § 906.41   Additional supporting documentation for acquisition of non-public housing for homeownership.

#### § § 906.41

      (a)  The PHA must submit an acquisition proposal to the HUD field office for review and approval before its homeownership plan containing acquisition of non-public housing can be approved. This proposal must contain the following:

      (6)  A copy of the PHA acquisition schedule;

      (7)  (i) The environmental information required by § 906.47(f), where HUD will perform the environmental review under 24 CFR part 50, or a statement identifying the responsible entity that has performed or will perform the review under 24 CFR part 58. This paragraph (a)(7)(i) does not apply to a property where a contract or agreement for sale to the PHA has already been executed and HUD has already given prior approval of the property following environmental review under 24 CFR part 50.

      (ii) Where the PHA's homeownership program is submitted for approval to HUD and contemplates acquisition of properties not identified at the time of submission or approval, the procedures at § 906.47(e) apply.

      (9)  Any additional information that may be needed for HUD to determine whether it can approve the proposal.

      (b)  The acquisition cost of each property is limited by the housing cost cap limit, as determined by HUD.

      § 906.43   Where a PHA is to submit a homeownership program for HUD approval.

#### § § 906.43

      A PHA must submit its proposed homeownership program together with supporting documentation, in a format prescribed by HUD, to the Special Applications Center with a copy to the appropriate HUD field office.

      § 906.45   HUD criteria for reviewing a proposed homeownership program.

#### § § 906.45

      HUD will use the following criteria in reviewing a homeownership program:

      (a)  The program must be practically feasible, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement.

      (b)  Counsel for the PHA shall certify that the homeownership program is consistent with applicable law, including the requirements of this part and any other applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including existing contracts, and HUD shall accept such certification unless HUD has information indicating that the certification is incorrect.

      (c)  The program must be clear and complete enough to serve as a working document for implementation, as well as a basis for HUD review.

      (d)  The PHA (and any other entity with substantial responsibility for implementing the homeownership program) must have demonstrated the commitment and capability to successfully implement the homeownership program based upon the criteria stated in § 906.41(d).

      § 906.47   Environmental requirements.

#### § § 906.47

      (a)  HUD environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 58 apply to this part, unless, under § 58.11 of this title, HUD itself performs the environmental review under 24 CFR part 50. The PHA conducting a homeownership program under this part must comply with this section and part 50 or 58, as applicable.

      (b)  Where the PHA's homeownership program involves assistance provided under the 1937 Act solely to assist homebuyers to purchase existing dwelling units or dwelling units under construction, an environmental review is not required under part 58 or part 50 of this title. However, the requirements of § 58.6 or § 50.19(b)(15) of this title are still applicable.

      (c)  Before the PHA rehabilitates or repairs units in its inventory for use for homeownership, or expends or commits HUD or local funds for such activities, the responsible entity must comply with part 58 and the PHA, where required, must submit and receive HUD approval of its request for release of funds, or HUD must have completed any part 50 environmental review and notified the PHA of its approval of the property. HUD may not release funds under this part before the appropriate approval is obtained.

      (d)  A PHA may not enter into any contract for acquisition of real property to be used in a homeownership program unless the required environmental reviews have been performed and approvals have been obtained.

      (e)  Where the PHA's homeownership program contemplates acquisition of properties not identified at the time of submission, the PHA must certify that it will comply with this section, including paragraph (f) of this section, prior to such acquisition or construction. HUD may conditionally approve such a homeownership program; however, HUD will not give final approval of any site or unit until the required environmental review has been completed.

      (f)  The PHA shall supply all relevant information necessary for the responsible entity, or HUD, if applicable, to perform the environmental review for each property included in the homeownership program, and, if necessary, shall carry out mitigating measures or select alternate eligible properties. Where HUD performs the environmental review, the PHA shall comply with 24 CFR 50.3(h).

      (g)  Nothing in this section relieves the participating PHA, and its partners and contractors, from complying with all requirements of 24 CFR part 50 or part 58, as applicable.

      § 906.49   HUD approval; implementing agreement.

#### § § 906.49

      HUD may approve a homeownership program as submitted, conditionally approve it under § 906.47(e), or return it to the PHA for revision and resubmission. Where such conditional approval is given, the PHA, partners, and contractors remain subject to the restrictions in § 906.47. Upon HUD notification to the PHA that the homeownership program is approvable (in final form that satisfies all applicable requirements of this part), the PHA and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement, in a form prescribed by HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The program itself, as approved by HUD, must be incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also be incorporated, if agreeable to the PHA and HUD. The PHA is obligated to carry out the approved homeownership program and other provisions of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD.

  PART 907—SUBSTANTIAL DEFAULT BY A PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCY

### Part 907

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437d(j), 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 10162, Feb. 23, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

    § 907.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 907.1

    This part provides the criteria and procedures for determining and declaring substantial default by a public housing agency (PHA) and the actions available to HUD to address and remedy substantial default by a PHA. Nothing in this part shall limit the discretion of HUD to take any action available under the provisions of section 6(j)(3)(A) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)), any applicable annual contributions contract (ACC), or any other law or regulation that may authorize HUD to take actions against a PHA that is in substantial default.

    § 907.3   Bases for substantial default.

#### § § 907.3

    (a)  A PHA may be declared in substantial default when the PHA:

    (1) Violates a federal statute;

    (2) Violates a federal regulation; or

    (3) Violates one or more terms of an ACC, or other covenants or conditions to which the PHA is subject.

    (b)  In addition to the violations listed in paragraph (a) of this section, in the case where a PHA is designated as a troubled performer under PHAS, the PHA shall be in substantial default if the PHA:

    (1) Fails to execute an MOA;

    (2) Fails to comply with the terms of an MOA; or

    (3) Fails to show substantial improvement, as provided in § 902.75(d) of this chapter.

    § 907.5   Procedures for declaring substantial default.

#### § § 907.5

    (a)  If the PHA is found in substantial default, the PHA shall be notified of such determination in writing. Except in situations as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the PHA shall have an opportunity to respond to the written determination, and an opportunity to cure the default, if a cure of the default is determined appropriate by HUD. The determination of substantial default shall be transmitted to the Executive Director of the PHA, the Chairperson of the Board of the PHA, and the appointing authority(ies) of the PHA's Board of Commissioners, and shall:

    (1) Identify the specific statute, regulation, covenants, conditions, or agreements of which the PHA is determined to be in violation;

    (2) Identify the specific events, occurrences, or conditions that constitute the violation;

    (3) Specify the time period, which shall be a period of 10 but not more than 30 days, during which the PHA shall have an opportunity to demonstrate that the determination or finding is not substantively accurate, if required;

    (4) If determined by HUD to be appropriate, provide for an opportunity to cure and specify the time period for the cure; and

    (5) Notify the PHA that, absent a satisfactory response in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, action shall be taken as determined by HUD to be appropriate.

    (b)  Upon receipt of the notification described in paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may submit a response, in writing and within the specified time period, demonstrating:

    (1) The description of events, occurrences, or conditions described in the written determination of substantial default is in error, or establish that the events, occurrences, or conditions described in the written determination of substantial default do not constitute noncompliance with the statute, regulation, covenants, conditions, or agreements that are cited in the notification under paragraph (a) of this section; or

    (2) If any opportunity to cure is provided, that the violations have been cured or will be cured in the time period specified by HUD.

    (c)  A PHA may waive, in writing, receipt of written notification from HUD of a finding of substantial default and the opportunity to respond to such finding. HUD may then immediately proceed with the remedies as provided in § 907.7.

    (d)  A PHA shall not be afforded the opportunity to respond to a written determination or to cure a substantial default in any case where:

    (1) HUD determines that conditions exist that pose an imminent threat to the life, health, or safety of public housing residents or residents of the surrounding neighborhood; or

    (2) The events or conditions precipitating the default are determined to be the result of criminal or fraudulent activity.

    § 907.7   Remedies for substantial default.

#### § § 907.7

    (a) Except as provided in § 907.7(c), upon determining that events have occurred or conditions exist that constitute a substantial default, HUD may:

    (1) Take any action provided for in section 6(j)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3));

    (2) Provide technical assistance for existing PHA management staff; or

    (3) Provide assistance deemed necessary, in the discretion of HUD, to remedy emergency conditions.

    (b) HUD may take any of the actions described in paragraph (a) of this section sequentially or simultaneously in any combination.

    (c) In the case of a substantial default by a troubled PHA pursuant to § 902.83(b):

    (1) For a PHA with 1,250 or more units, HUD shall petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)); or

    (2) For a PHA with fewer than 1,250 units, HUD shall either petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)), or take possession of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA) pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(iv) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(iv)), and appoint, on a competitive or noncompetitive basis, an individual or entity as an administrative receiver to assume the responsibilities of HUD for the administration of all or part of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA).

    (d) To the extent feasible, while a PHA is operating under any of the actions that may have been taken by HUD, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.

    (e) HUD may limit remedies under this part to one or more of a PHA's specific operational areas ( maintenance, capital improvement, occupancy, or financial management), to a single program or group of programs, or to a single project or a group of projects. For example, HUD may select, or participate in the selection of, an AME to assume management responsibility for a specific project, a group of projects in a geographical area, or a specific operational area, while permitting the PHA to retain responsibility for all programs, operational areas, and projects not so designated.

  PART 908—ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF REQUIRED FAMILY DATA FOR PUBLIC HOUSING, INDIAN HOUSING, AND THE SECTION 8 RENTAL VOUCHER, AND MODERATE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS

### Part 908

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437f, 3535(d), 3543, 3544, and 3608a.

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 11628, Mar. 2, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

    § 908.101   Purpose.

#### § § 908.101

    The purpose of this part is to require Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), including Moving-to-Work (MTW) PHAs, that operate Public Housing, Indian Housing, or Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs to electronically submit certain data to HUD for those programs. These electronically submitted data are required for HUD forms: HUD-50058, including the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Addendum. Applicable program entities must retain at a minimum, the last three years of the form HUD-50058, and supporting documentation, during the term of each assisted lease, and for a period of at least 3 years from the end of participation (EOP) date, to support billings to HUD and to permit an effective audit. Electronic retention of form HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS and supporting documentation fulfills the record retention requirement under this section.

> [74 FR 68934, Dec. 29, 2009, as amended at 89 FR 38293, May 7, 2024]

    § 908.104   Requirements.

#### § § 908.104

    (a)  Housing agencies that currently use automated software packages to transmit Forms HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS information by tape or diskette to the Department's data processing contractor must convert to telephonic electronic transmission of that data in a HUD specified format by June 30, 1995.

    (b)  Housing agencies that currently prepare and transmit the HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS information to HUD paper must:

    (1) Complete a vendor search and obtain either:

    (i) The necessary hardware and software required to develop and maintain an in-house automated data processing system (ADP) used to generate electronic submission of the data for these forms via telephonic network; or

    (ii) A service contract for the operation of an automated system to generate electronic submission of the data for these forms via telephonic network;

    (2) Complete their data loading; and

    (3) Begin electronic transmission by March 2, 1996.

    (c)  Electronic transmission of data consists of submission of all required data fields (correctly formatted) from the forms HUD-050058 and HUD-50058-FSS telephonically, in accordance with HUD instructions. Regardless of whether an HA obtains the ADP system itself or contracts with a service bureau to provide the system, the software must be periodically updated to incorporate changes or revisions in legislation, regulations, handbooks, notices, or HUD electronic transmission data format requirements.

    (d)  HAs that determine that the purchase of hardware and/or software is not cost effective may contract out the electronic data transmission function to organizations that provide such services, including, but not limited to the following organizations: local management associations and management agents with centralized facilities. HAs that contract out the electronic transmission function must retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the project at the HA site and be able to demonstrate the ability to the relevant HUD Field Office.

    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Department may approve transmission of the data by tape or diskette if it determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive.

    § 908.108   Cost.

#### § § 908.108

    (a)  The costs of the electronic transmission of the correctly formatted data, including either the purchase and maintenance of computer hardware or software, or both, the cost of contracting for those services, or the cost of centralizing the electronic transmission function, shall be considered Section 8 Administrative expenses, or eligible public and Indian housing operating expenses that can be included in the public and Indian housing operating budget. At the HA's option, the cost of the computer software may include service contracts to provide maintenance or training, or both.

    (b)  For public and Indian housing, costs may be covered from operating subsidy for which the HA is already eligible, or the initial cost may be covered by funds received by the HA under HUD's Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) or Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP). For Section 8 programs, the costs may be covered from ongoing administrative fees or the Section 8 operating reserve.

    § 908.112   Extension of time.

#### § § 908.112

    The HUD Field Office may grant an HA an extension of time, of a reasonable period, for implementation of the requirements of § 908.104, if it determines that such electronic submission is infeasible because of one of the following:

    (a) Lack of staff resources;

    (b) Insufficient financial resources to purchase the required hardware, software or contractual services; or

    (c) Lack of adequate infrastructure, including, but not limited to, the inability to obtain telephone service to transmit the required data.

  PART 943—PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCY CONSORTIA AND JOINT VENTURES

### Part 943

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437k and 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 71207, Nov. 29, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 943.100   What is the purpose of this part?

#### § § 943.100

      This part authorizes public housing agencies (PHAs) to form consortia, joint ventures, affiliates, subsidiaries, partnerships, and other business arrangements under section 13 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437k). Under this authority, PHAs participating in a consortium enter into a consortium agreement, submit joint PHA Plans to HUD, and may combine all or part of their funding and program administration. This part does not preclude a PHA from entering cooperative arrangements to operate its programs under other authority, as long as they are consistent with other program regulations and requirements.

    Subpart B—Consortia

      § 943.115   What programs are covered under this subpart?

#### § § 943.115

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart applies to the following:

      (1) PHA administration of public housing or Section 8 programs under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD; and

      (2) PHA administration of grants to the PHA in connection with its public housing or Section 8 programs.

      (b) This subpart does not apply to the following:

      (1) PHA administration of Section 8 projects assigned to a PHA for contract administration pursuant to an ACC entered under the Request for Proposals (RFP) published May 19, 1999 (64 FR 27358);

      (2) Section 8 contract administration of a restructured subsidized multifamily project by a Participating Administrative Entity in accordance with part 401 of this title; or

      (3) A PHA in its capacity as owner of a Section 8 project.

      § 943.118   What is a consortium?

#### § § 943.118

      A consortium consists of two or more PHAs that join together to perform planning, reporting, and other administrative or management functions for participating PHAs, as specified in a consortium agreement. A consortium also submits a joint PHA Plan. The lead agency collects the assistance funds from HUD that would be paid to the participating PHAs for the elements of their operations that are administered by the consortium and allocates them according to the consortium agreement. The participating PHAs must adopt the same fiscal year so that the applicable periods for submission and review of the joint PHA Plan are the same. Notwithstanding any other regulation, PHAs proposing to form consortia may request and HUD may approve changes in PHA fiscal years to make this possible.

      § 943.120   What programs of a PHA are included in a consortium's functions?

#### § § 943.120

      (a) A PHA may enter a consortium under this subpart for administration of any of the following program categories:

      (1) The PHA's public housing program (which may include either the operating fund or the capital fund, or both);

      (2) The PHA's Section 8 voucher program (including the project-based voucher program and special housing types);

      (3) The PHA's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, including Single Room Occupancy program;

      (4) All other project-based Section 8 programs administered by the PHA under an ACC with HUD; and

      (5) Any grant programs of the PHA in connection with its Section 8 or public housing programs, such as the Drug Elimination program or the Resident Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency program, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the governing documents for the grant program's funding source.

      (b) If a PHA elects to enter a consortium with respect to a category specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the consortium must cover the PHA's whole program under the ACC with HUD for that category, including all dwelling units and all funding for that program under the ACC with HUD.

> [65 FR 71207, Nov. 29, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 38293, May 7, 2024]

      § 943.122   How is a consortium organized?

#### § § 943.122

      (a) PHAs that elect to form a consortium enter into a consortium agreement among the participating PHAs, specifying a lead agency (see § 943.124), and submit a joint PHA Plan (§ 943.118). HUD enters into any necessary payment agreements with the lead agency and the other participating PHAs (see § 943.126) to provide that HUD funding to the participating PHAs for program categories covered by the consortium will be paid to the lead agency.

      (b) The lead agency must not be a PHA that is designated as a “troubled PHA” by HUD, that has been determined by HUD to fail the civil rights compliance threshold for new funding, or that has had a PHAS designation withheld for civil rights or other reasons. The lead agency is designated to receive HUD program payments on behalf of participating PHAs, to administer HUD requirements for administration of the funds, and to apply the funds in accordance with the consortium agreement and HUD regulations and requirements.

      § 943.124   What elements must a consortium agreement contain?

#### § § 943.124

      (a) The consortium agreement among the participating PHAs governs the formation and operation of the consortium. The consortium agreement must be consistent with any payment agreements between the participating PHAs and HUD and must specify the following:

      (1) The names of the participating PHAs and the program categories each PHA is including under the consortium agreement;

      (2) The name of the lead agency;

      (3) The functions to be performed by the lead agency and the other participating PHAs during the term of the consortium;

      (4) The allocation of funds among participating PHAs and responsibility for administration of funds paid to the consortium; and

      (5) The period of existence of the consortium and the terms under which a PHA may join or withdraw from the consortium before the end of that period. To provide for orderly transition, addition or withdrawal of a PHA and termination of the consortium must take effect on the anniversary of the consortium's fiscal year.

      (b) The agreement must acknowledge that the participating PHAs are subject to the joint PHA Plan submitted by the lead agency.

      (c) The agreement must be signed by an authorized representative of each participating PHA.

      § 943.126   What is the relationship between HUD and a consortium?

#### § § 943.126

      HUD has a direct relationship with the consortium through the PHA Plan process and through one or more payment agreements, executed in a form prescribed by HUD, under which HUD and the participating PHAs agree that program funds will be paid to the lead agency on behalf of the participating PHAs. Such funds must be used in accordance with the consortium agreement, the joint PHA Plan and HUD regulations and requirements.

      § 943.128   How does a consortium carry out planning and reporting functions?

#### § § 943.128

      (a) During the term of the consortium agreement, the consortium must submit joint five-year Plans and joint Annual Plans for all participating PHAs, in accordance with part 903 of this chapter. HUD may prescribe methods of submission for consortia generally and where the consortium does not cover all program categories.

      (b) The consortium must maintain records and submit reports to HUD, in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements, for all of the participating PHAs. All PHAs will be bound by Plans and reports submitted to HUD by the consortium for programs covered by the consortium.

      (c) Each PHA must keep a copy of the consortium agreement on file for inspection. The consortium agreement must also be a supporting document to the joint PHA Plan.

      § 943.130   What are the responsibilities of participating PHAs?

#### § § 943.130

      (a)  Despite participation in a consortium, each participating PHA remains responsible for its own obligations under its ACC with HUD. This means that the PHA has an obligation to assure that all program funds, including funds paid to the lead agency for administration by the consortium, are used in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements, and that the PHA program is administered in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements. Any breach of program requirements with respect to a program covered by the consortium agreement is a breach of the ACC with each of the participating PHAs, so each PHA is responsible for the performance of the consortium.

      (b)  Where the lead agency will manage substantially all program and activities of the consortium, HUD interprets financial accountability to rest with the consortium and thus HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements on a consortium-wide basis. Where the lead agency will not manage substantially all programs and activities of a consortium, the consortium shall indicate in its PHA Plan submission which PHAs have financial accountability for the programs. The determination of financial accountability shall be made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as determined in consultation with an independent public accountant. In such situations, HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements consistent with that determination. With respect to any consortium, however, HUD may determine (based on a request from the consortium or other circumstances) to apply independent audit and performance requirements on a different basis where this would promote sound management.

    Subpart C—Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Joint Ventures in Public Housing

      § 943.140   What programs and activities are covered by this subpart?

#### § § 943.140

      (a) This subpart applies to the provision of a PHA's public housing administrative and management functions, and to the provision (or arranging for the provision) of supportive and social services in connection with public housing. This subpart does not apply to activities of a PHA that are subject to the requirements of part 941, subpart F, of this title.

      (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term “joint venture partner” means a participant (other than a PHA) in a joint venture, partnership, or other business arrangement or contract for services with a PHA.

      (c) This part does not affect a PHA's authority to use joint ventures, as may be permitted under State law, when using non-1937 Act funds.

      § 943.142   In what types of operating organizations may a PHA participate?

#### § § 943.142

      (a) A PHA may create and operate a wholly owned or controlled subsidiary or other affiliate; may enter into joint ventures, partnerships, or other business arrangements with individuals, organizations, entities, or governmental units. A subsidiary or affiliate may be a nonprofit corporation. A subsidiary or affiliate may be an organization controlled by the same persons who serve on the governing board of the PHA or who are employees of the PHA.

      (b) The purpose of any of these operating organizations would be to administer programs of the PHA.

      § 943.144   What financial impact do operations of a subsidiary, affiliate, or joint venture have on a PHA?

#### § § 943.144

      Income generated by subsidiaries, affiliates, or joint ventures formed under the authority of this subpart is to be used for low-income housing or to benefit the residents assisted by the PHA. This income will not cause a decrease in funding provided under the public housing program, except as otherwise provided under the Operating Fund and Capital Fund formulas.

      § 943.146   What impact does the use of a subsidiary, affiliate, or joint venture have on financial accountability to HUD and the Federal government?

#### § § 943.146

      None; the subsidiary, affiliate, or joint venture is subject to the same authority of HUD, HUD's Inspector General, and the Comptroller General to audit its conduct.

      § 943.148   What procurement standards apply to PHAs selecting partners for a joint venture?

#### § § 943.148

      (a) The requirements of part 85 of this title are applicable to this part, subject to paragraph (b) of this section, in connection with the PHA's public housing program.

      (b) A PHA may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement (request for qualifications or “RFQ”), or may solicit a proposal from only one source (“sole source”) to select a joint venture partner to perform an administrative or management function of its public housing program or to provide or arrange to provide supportive or social services covered under this part, under the following circumstances:

      (1) The proposed joint venture partner has under its control and will make available to the partnership substantial, unique and tangible resources or other benefits that would not otherwise be available to the PHA on the open market ( planning expertise, program experience, or financial or other resources). In this case, the PHA must maintain documentation to substantiate both the cost reasonableness of its selection of the proposed partner and the unique qualifications of the partner: or

      (2) A resident group or a PHA subsidiary is willing and able to act as the PHA's partner in performing administrative and management functions or to provide supportive or social services. This entity must comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 (if the entity is a nonprofit or a State or local government) with respect to its selection of the members of the team and the members must be paid on a cost-reimbursement basis only. The PHA must maintain documentation that indicates both the cost reasonableness of its selection of a resident group or PHA subsidiary and the ability of that group or subsidiary to act as the PHA's partner under this provision.

> [65 FR 71207, Nov. 29, 2000, as amended at 80 FR 75942, Dec. 7, 2015]

      § 943.150   What procurement standards apply to a PHA's joint venture partner?

#### § § 943.150

      (a)  A joint venture partner is not a grantee or subgrantee and, accordingly, is not required to comply with 2 CFR part 200 in its procurement of goods and services under this part. The partner must comply with all applicable State and local procurement and conflict of interest requirements with respect to its selection of entities to assist in PHA program administration.

      (b)  If the joint venture partner is a subsidiary, affiliate, or identity of interest party of the PHA, it is subject to the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 of this title. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt such a joint venture partner from the need to comply with requirements under 2 CFR part 200 of this title if HUD determines that the joint venture has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.

      (c)  A joint venture partner may contract with an identity-of-interest party for goods or services, or a party specified in the selected bidder's response to a RFP or RFQ (as applicable), without the need for further procurement if:

      (1) The PHA can demonstrate that its original competitive selection of the partner clearly anticipated the later provision of such goods or services;

      (2) Compensation of all identity-of-interest parties is structured to ensure there is no duplication of profit or expenses; and

      (3) The PHA can demonstrate that its selection is reasonable based upon prevailing market costs and standards, and that the quality and timeliness of the goods or services is comparable to that available in the open market. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an “identity-of-interest party” means a party that is wholly owned or controlled by, or that is otherwise affiliated with, the partner or the PHA. The PHA may use an independent organization experienced in cost valuation to determine the cost reasonableness of the proposed contracts.

  PART 945—DESIGNATED HOUSING—PUBLIC HOUSING DESIGNATED FOR OCCUPANCY BY DISABLED, ELDERLY, OR DISABLED AND ELDERLY FAMILIES

### Part 945

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1473e and 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 17662, Apr. 13, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 945.101   Purpose.

#### § § 945.101

      The purpose of this part is to provide for designated housing as authorized by section 7 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437e). Section 7 provides public housing agencies with the option, subject to the requirements and procedures of this part, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing projects, for occupancy by disabled families, elderly families, or mixed populations of disabled families and elderly families.

      § 945.103   General policies.

#### § § 945.103

      (a)  Participation in this program is limited to public housing agencies (PHAs) (as this term is defined in 24 CFR 913.102) that elect to designate public housing projects for occupancy by disabled families, elderly families, or disabled families and elderly families, as provided by this part.

      (b) —(1)  Projects eligible for designation under this part are public housing projects as described in the definition of “project” in § 945.105.

      (2)  To meet the housing and supportive service needs of elderly families, and disabled families, including non-elderly disabled families, who will not be housed in a designated project, PHAs shall utilize housing resources that they own, control, or have received preliminary notification that they will obtain (e.g., section 8 vouchers). They also may utilize housing resources for which they plan to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan, and that they have a reasonable expectation of obtaining. PHAs also may utilize, to the extent practicable, any housing facilities that they own or control in which supportive services are already provided, facilitated or coordinated, such as mixed housing, shared housing, family housing, group homes, and congregate housing.

      (3)  A PHA with a public housing project with a mixed population of elderly families and disabled families that plans to house them in such project in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, is not required to meet the designation requirements of this part.

      (c) —(1)  The election to reside in designated housing is voluntary on the part of a family. No disabled family or elderly family may be required to reside in designated housing, nor shall a decision not to reside in designated housing adversely affect the family with respect to occupancy of another appropriate project.

      (2)  Nothing in this part shall be construed to require or permit a PHA to accept for admission to a designated project a disabled family or elderly family who does not meet the stated eligibility requirements for occupancy in the project (for example, income), as set forth in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR parts 912 and 913, and in the PHA's admission policies.

      (B) The number of families who are not members of the group for whom the project is to be designated;

      (ii) An estimate of the total number of elderly families and disabled families who are potential tenants of the project (i.e., as the project now exists), based on information provided by:

      (A) The waiting list from which vacancies in the project are filled; and

      (B) A local housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS, for the jurisdiction within which the area served by the PHA is located;

      (iii) An estimate of the number of potential tenants who will need accessible units based on information provided by:

      (A) The needs assessment prepared in accordance with 24 CFR 8.25, and

      (B) A housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS or HUD-prescribed successor survey;

      (iv) The number of units in the project that became vacant and available for occupancy during the year preceding the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD;

      (v) The average length of vacancy for dwelling units in the project for the year preceding the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD;

      (vi) An estimate of the number of units in the project that the PHA expects to become vacant and available for occupancy during the two-year period following the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD (i.e., if the project were not to be designated);

      (5)  This component of the plan must describe any changes the PHA intends to make in its admission policies to accommodate the designation, including:

      (i) How the waiting list will be maintained;

      (ii) How dwelling units will be assigned; and

      (iii) How records will be maintained to document the effect on all families who would have resided in the designated project if it had not been designated.

      (6)  The PHA must:

      (i) Identify the housing resources currently owned or controlled by the PHA, including any mixed population projects, in existence, as provided in 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, that will be available to these families;

      (ii) Describe the steps to be taken by the PHA to respond to any need for accessible units that will no longer be available for applicants who need them. The PHA has a continuing obligation under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) to provide accessible dwellings even if the project designation removes accessible dwellings from the inventory of possible dwellings for non-elderly persons with disabilities;

      (iii) If a project is being designated for elderly families, describe the steps the PHA will take to facilitate access to supportive services by non-elderly disabled families. The services should be equivalent to those available in the designated project and requested by non-elderly disabled families. If the PHA funds supportive services for the designated project for elderly families, the PHA must provide the same level of services, upon the request of non-elderly disabled families.

      (iv) If a project is being designated for elderly families, identify the additional housing resources that the PHA determines will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed by the PHA if occupancy in units in the designated project were not restricted to elderly families (one-for-one replacement is not required). Among these resources may be:

      (A) Normal turnover in existing projects;

      (B) Existing housing stock that previously was not available to or considered for non-elderly disabled families. Examples are dwellings in general occupancy (family) projects that are reconfigured to meet the dwelling size needs of the non-elderly disabled families, or were previously occupied by elderly families who will relocate to the designated project for elderly families, or were previously vacant because there had not been a demand for dwellings of that size in that location;

      (C) Housing for which the PHA has received preliminary notification that it will obtain; and

      (D) Housing for which the PHA plans to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan, and which it has a reasonable expectation of obtaining.

      (v) Where a project is being designated for elderly families, explain how the PHA plans to secure the required additional housing resources. In the case of housing for which the PHA plans to apply, the PHA must provide sufficient information about the housing resource and its application to establish that the PHA can reasonably expect to obtain the housing.

      (vi) Describe incentives, if any, that the PHA intends to offer to:

      (A) Families who are members of the group for whom a project was designated _to_ achieve voluntary transfers  the designated project; and

      (B) Families who are not members of the group for whom a project was designated to achieve voluntary transfers  the project proposed to be designated;

      (d)  HUD shall approve an initial allocation plan, or updated allocation plan, if HUD determines that:

      (1) The information contained in the plan is complete and accurate (a plan that is incomplete, i.e., missing required statements or items, will be disapproved), and the projections are reasonable;

      (2) Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial increase in the vacancy rates in the designated project;

      (3) Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial increase in delaying or denying housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because of designating projects;

      (4) The plan for securing sufficient additional housing resources for non-elderly disabled persons can reasonably be achieved; and

      (5) The plan conforms to the requirements of this part.

      (e) —(1)  HUD shall notify each PHA, in writing, of approval or disapproval of the initial or updated allocation plan.

      (2)  An allocation plan shall be considered to be approved by HUD if HUD fails to provide the PHA with notification of approval or disapproval of the plan, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, within:

      (i) 90 days after the date of submission of an allocation plan that contains comments, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or

      (ii) 45 days after the date of submission of all other plans, including

      (A) Initial plans for which no comments were received;

      (B) Updated plans, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section; and

      (C) Revised initial plans or revised updated plans, as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

      (3)  HUD's approval of an initial plan or updated allocation plan under this section may not be construed to constitute approval of any request for assistance for major reconstruction of obsolete projects, assistance for development or acquisition of public housing, or assistance under 24 CFR part 890 (supportive housing for persons with disabilities).

      (4)  If HUD disapproves an initial allocation plan, a PHA shall have a period of not less than 45 days or more than 90 days following notification of disapproval as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, to submit amendments to the plan, or to submit a revised plan.

      (f) —(1)  Each PHA that owns or operates a public housing project that is designated for occupancy under this part shall update its allocation plan not less than once every two years, from the date of HUD approval of the initial allocation plan. A PHA that wishes to amend or revise its plan later than 90 days after HUD disapproval must begin the hearing and consultation process again.

      (2)  If the PHA fails to submit the updated plan as required by this paragraph (f), the Secretary may revoke the designation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.

      (3)  The updated allocation plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:

      (i) The most recent update of the allocation plan data, and projections for the next two years;

      (ii) An assessment of the accuracy of the projections contained in previous plans and in the updated allocation plan;

      (iii) The number of times a vacancy was filled in accordance with § 945.303(c);

      (iv) A discussion of the impact of the designation on the designated project and the other public housing projects operated by the PHA, using the data obtained from the system developed in § 945.203(c), including

      (A) The number of times there was a substantial increase in delaying housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because projects were designated; and

      (B) The number of times there was a substantial increase in denying housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because projects were designated;

      (v) A plan for adjusting the allocation of designated units, if necessary.

      (4)  (i) HUD shall approve an updated allocation plan based on HUD's review and assessment of the updated plan, using the criteria in (d) of this section. If HUD considers it appropriate, the review and assessment shall include any on-site review and monitoring of PHA performance in the administration of its designated housing and in the allocation of the PHA's housing resources. Notification of approval or disapproval of the updated allocation plan shall be provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

      (ii) If a PHA's updated plan is not approved, HUD may require PHAs to change the designation of existing or planned projects to other categories, such as general occupancy or mixed population projects.

      (5)  HUD shall notify each PHA submitting an updated plan of approval or disapproval of the updated plan, in accordance with the form of notification and within the time periods required by paragraph (e) of this section.

      (i) Identify the number of disabled families who need the supportive services and who have expressed an interest in receiving them;

      (ii) Describe the types of supportive services that will be provided, and, if known, the length of time the supportive services will be available;

      (iii) Identify each service provider to be utilized, and describe the experience of the service provider in delivering supportive services;

      (iv) Describe how the supportive services will be provided to the disabled families that the designated housing is expected to serve (how the services will be provided depends upon the type of service offered; e.g., if the package includes transportation assistance, how transportation assistance will be provided to disabled families);

      (v) Identify all sources of funding upon which the PHA is relying to deliver supportive services to residents of the designated housing for disabled families, or the supportive service resources to be provided in lieu of funding;

      (vi) Submit evidence of a specific contractual commitment or commitments provided to the PHA by the sources identified in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section to make funds available for supportive services, or the delivery of supportive services available to the PHA for at least two calendar years;

(These comments must be maintained for a period of five years, and be available for review by HUD as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section.);

      (viii) If applicable, address the need for residential supervision of disabled families (on-site supervision within the designated housing) and how this supervision is to be provided;

      (ix) Include any other information that the PHA determines would assist HUD in assessing the suitability of the PHA's supportive service plan; and

      (x) Include any additional information that HUD may request, and which is appropriate to a determination of the suitability of the supportive service plan.

      (2)  In preparing the initial supportive service plan, or any update of the supportive service plan, the PHA shall:

      (i) Issue public notices regarding its intention to provide supportive services to designated housing for disabled families and the availability of the draft supportive service plan;

      (ii) Send notices directly to interested individuals and agencies that have contacted the PHA and have expressed an interest in the supportive service plan, and to parties specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section;

      (iii) Allow not less than 30 days for public comment on the supportive service plan;

      (iv) Make free copies of the draft plan available upon request, and in accessible format, when appropriate;

      § 945.303   Requirements governing occupancy in designated housing.

#### § § 945.303

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in determining priority for admission to designated housing, the PHA shall make units in the designated housing available only to designated families.

      (b)  Among the designated families, the PHA shall give preference in accordance with the preferences in 24 CFR part 960, subpart B.

      (c) —(1)  If there are an insufficient number of elderly families for the units in a project designated for elderly families, the PHA may make dwelling units available to near-elderly families, who qualify for preferences under 24 CFR part 960, subpart B. The election to make dwelling units available to near-elderly families if there are an insufficient number of elderly families should be explained in the PHA's allocation plan.

      (2)  If there are an insufficient number of elderly families and near-elderly families for the units in a project designated for elderly families, the PHA shall make available to all other families any dwelling unit that is:

      (i) Ready for re-rental and for a new lease to take effect; and

      (ii) Vacant for more than 60 consecutive days.

      (d)  (1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the decision of any disabled family or elderly family not to occupy or accept occupancy in designated housing shall not have an adverse affect on:

      (i) The family's admission to or continued occupancy in public housing; or

      (ii) The family's position on or placement on a public housing waiting list.

      (2) The protection provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply to any family who refuses to occupy or accept occupancy in designated housing because of the race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin of the occupants of the designated housing or the surrounding area.

      (3) The protection provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to an elderly family or disabled family that declines to accept occupancy, respectively, in a designated project for elderly families or for disabled families, and requests occupancy in a general occupancy project or in a mixed population project.

      (e)  This part may not be construed to require a PHA to offer a dwelling in a designated project to any family who is not of appropriate family size for the dwelling unit. The temporary absence of a child from the home due to placement in foster care is not considered in determining family composition and family size.

      (f)  Any tenant who is lawfully residing in a dwelling unit in a public housing project may not be evicted or otherwise required to vacate the unit because of the designation of the project, or because of any action taken by HUD or the PHA in accordance with this part.

      (g)  As with other HUD-assisted housing, no disabled family or elderly family residing in designated housing may be required to accept supportive services made available by the PHA under this part.

      (h)  The grievance procedures in 24 CFR part 966, subpart B, which applies to public housing tenants, is applicable to this part.

      (ii) The amount of the monthly subsidy provided for the unit, which will be determined by adding the per unit assistance provided to a public housing property as calculated through the applicable formulas for the Public Housing Capital Fund and Public Housing Operating Fund.

      (A) For the Public Housing Capital Fund, the amount of Capital Funds provided to the unit will be calculated as the per unit Capital Fund assistance provided to a PHA for the development in which the family resides for the most recent funding year for which Capital Funds have been allocated;

      (B) For the Public Housing Operating Fund, the amount of Operating Funds provided to the unit will be calculated as the per unit amount provided to the public housing project where the unit is located for the most recent funding year for which a final funding obligation determination has been made;

      (C) HUD will publish such funding amounts no later than December 31 each year.

      See § 960.253(d).

      For HUD's public housing program, “covered housing provider,” as such term is in used HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), is the PHA.

      § 960.202   Tenant selection policies.

#### § § 960.202

      (a)  (1) The PHA shall establish and adopt written policies for admission of tenants.

      (2) These policies shall provide for and include the following:

      (i) Targeting admissions to extremely low income families as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (ii) Deconcentration of poverty and income-mixing in accordance with the PHA Plan regulations (see 24 CFR part 903).

      (iii) Precluding admission of applicants whose habits and practices reasonably may be expected to have a detrimental effect on the residents or the project environment;

      (iv) Objective and reasonable policies for selection by the PHA among otherwise eligible applicants, including requirements for applications and waiting lists (see 24 CFR 1.4), and for verification and documentation of information relevant to acceptance or rejection of an applicant, including documentation and verification of citizenship and eligible immigration status under 24 CFR part 5; and

      (v) Policies of participant transfer between units, developments, and programs. For example, a PHA could adopt a criterion for voluntary transfer that the tenant had met all obligations under the current program, including payment of charges to the PHA.

      (b) —(1)  (i) Not less than 40 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's public housing program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low income families. This is called the “basic targeting requirement.”

      (ii) To the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, admission of extremely low income families to the PHA's Section 8 voucher program during the same PHA fiscal year is credited against the basic targeting requirement.

      (iii) A PHA must comply with both the targeting requirement found in this part and the deconcentration requirements found in part 903 of this chapter.

      (2)  (i) If admissions of extremely low income families to the PHA's voucher program during a PHA fiscal year exceeds the 75 percent minimum targeting requirement for the PHA's voucher program (see 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)), such excess shall be credited (subject to the limitations in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) against the PHA's basic targeting requirement for the same fiscal year.

      (ii) The fiscal year credit for voucher program admissions that exceed the minimum voucher program targeting requirement shall not exceed the lower of:

      (A) Ten percent of public housing waiting list admissions during the PHA fiscal year;

      (B) Ten percent of waiting list admission to the PHA's Section 8 tenant-based assistance program during the PHA fiscal year; or

      (C) The number of qualifying low income families who commence occupancy during the fiscal year of PHA public housing units located in census tracts with a poverty rate of 30 percent or more. For this purpose, qualifying low income family means a low income family other than an extremely low income family.

      (c)  The PHA must adopt a preference for tenant-based and project-based families displaced due to HQS noncompliance in accordance with § 982.404(e)(2) and § 983.208(d)(6)(ii).

      (d)  These selection policies shall:

      (1) Be duly adopted and implemented;

      (2) Be publicized by posting copies thereof in each office where applications are received and by furnishing copies to applicants or tenants upon request, free or at their expense, at the discretion of the PHA; and

      (3) Be consistent with the fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of § 5.105 of this title; and

      (4) Be submitted to the HUD field office upon request from that office.

      § 960.203   Standards for PHA tenant selection criteria.

#### § § 960.203

      (a) The tenant selection criteria to be established and information to be considered shall be reasonably related to individual attributes and behavior of an applicant and shall not be related to those which may be imputed to a particular group or category of persons of which an applicant may be a member. The PHA may use local preferences, as provided in § 960.206.

      (b) Under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), PHAs that have adopted policies, implemented procedures and can document that they successfully screen out and deny admission to certain applicants with unfavorable criminal histories receive points. (See 24 CFR 902.43(a)(5).) This policy takes into account the importance of screening to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.

      (c) In selection of families for admission to its public housing program, or to occupy a public housing development or unit, the PHA is responsible for screening family behavior and suitability for tenancy. The PHA may consider all relevant information, which may include, but is not limited to:

      (1) An applicant's past performance in meeting financial obligations, especially rent;

      (2) A record of disturbance of neighbors, destruction of property, or living or housekeeping habits at prior residences which may adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of other tenants; and

      (3) A history of criminal activity involving crimes of physical violence to persons or property and other criminal acts which would adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of other tenants. (See § 960.204.) With respect to criminal activity described in § 960.204:

      (i) The PHA may require an applicant to exclude a household member in order to be admitted to the housing program where that household member has participated in or been culpable for actions described in § 960.204 that warrants denial.

      (ii) The PHA may, where a statute requires that the PHA prohibit admission for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, choose to continue that prohibition for a longer period of time.

      (4) PHA tenant selection criteria are subject to 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking). In cases of requests for emergency transfers under VAWA, with the written consent of the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the receiving PHA may accept and use the prior covered housing provider's determination of eligibility and tenant screening and all related verification information, including form HUD 50058 (Family Report).

      (d) In the event of the receipt of unfavorable information with respect to an applicant, consideration shall be given to the time, nature, and extent of the applicant's conduct (including the seriousness of the offense).

      (1) In a manner consistent with the PHA's policies, procedures and practices referenced in paragraph (b) of this section, consideration may be given to factors which might indicate a reasonable probability of favorable future conduct. For example:

      (i) Evidence of rehabilitation; and

      (ii) Evidence of the applicant family's participation in or willingness to participate in social service or other appropriate counseling service programs and the availability of such programs;

      (2)  (i) In determining whether to deny admission for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use, or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the PHA may require the applicant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.

      (ii) If rehabilitation is not an element of the eligibility determination (see § 960.204(a)(1)), the PHA may choose not to consider whether the person has been rehabilitated.

> [66 FR 28799, May 24, 2001, as amended at 73 FR 72344, Nov. 28, 2008; 75 FR 66262, Oct. 27, 2010; 81 FR 80815, Nov. 16, 2016]

      § 960.204   Denial of admission for criminal activity or drug abuse by household members.

#### § § 960.204

      (a) —(1)  The PHA standards must prohibit admission of an applicant to the PHA's public housing program for three years from the date of the eviction if any household member has been evicted from federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:

      (i) The evicted household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or

      (ii) The circumstances leading to the eviction no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).

      (2)  The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission of a household to the PHA's public housing program if:

      (i) The PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug (For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” the criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current); or

      (ii) The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal use or pattern of illegal use of a drug may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (3)  The PHA must establish standards that permanently prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.

      (4)  The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In the screening of applicants, the PHA must perform necessary criminal history background checks in the State where the housing is located and in other States where household members are known to have resided. (See part 5, subpart J of this title for provisions concerning access to sex offender registration records.)

      (b)  The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (c)  Before a PHA denies admission to the PHAs public housing program on the basis of a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant with a copy of the criminal record and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record. (See part 5, subpart J of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)

      (d)  The PHA may not pass along to the applicant the costs of a criminal records check.

      § 960.205   Drug use by applicants: Obtaining information from drug treatment facility.

#### § § 960.205

      (a)  This section addresses a PHA's authority to request and obtain information from drug abuse treatment facilities concerning applicants. This section does not apply to information requested or obtained from drug abuse treatment facilities other than under the authority of section 6(t).

      (b)  used in this section are as follows:

      (1)  Illegal use of a drug occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that there is continuing illegal drug use by a household member.

      (2)  An entity:

      (i) That holds itself out as providing, and provides, diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment with respect to the illegal drug use; and

      (ii) That is either an identified unit within a general care facility; or an entity other than a general medical care facility.

      (c)  (1) The PHA may require each applicant to submit for all household members who are at least 18 years of age, and for each family head or spouse regardless of age, one or more consent forms signed by such household member that:

      (i) Requests any drug abuse treatment facility to inform the PHA only whether the drug abuse treatment facility has reasonable cause to believe that the household member is currently engaging in illegal drug use;

      (ii) Complies with the form of written consent required by 42 CFR 2.31; and

      (iii) Authorizes the PHA to receive such information from the drug abuse treatment facility, and to utilize such information in determining whether to prohibit admission of the household member to the PHA's public housing program in accordance with § 960.203. (See the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2, and implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 2, with respect to responsibilities of the drug abuse treatment facility.)

      (2) The consent form submitted for a proposed household member must expire automatically after the PHA has made a final decision to either approve or deny the admission of such person.

      (d)  (1) The PHA may request that a drug abuse treatment facility disclose whether the drug abuse treatment facility has reasonable cause to believe that the proposed household member is currently engaging in the illegal use of a drug (as defined in § 5.100 of this title).

      (2) The PHA's request to the drug abuse treatment facility must include a copy of the consent form signed by the proposed household member.

      (3) A drug abuse treatment facility is not liable for damages based on any information required to be disclosed under this section if such disclosure is consistent with section 543 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290dd-2).

      (4) The PHA is not obligated to request information from a drug treatment facility under this section, and is not liable for damages for failing to request or receive such information.

      (5) A drug abuse treatment facility may charge the PHA a reasonable fee for information provided under this section. The PHA may not pass along to the applicant or tenant the costs of obtaining this information.

      (e)  (1) A PHA may request information from a drug abuse treatment facility under paragraph (d) of this section only if the PHA has adopted and has consistently implemented either of the following policies, obtaining a signed consent form from the proposed household members:

      (i)  Under Policy A, the PHA must submit a request for information to a drug abuse treatment facility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section before admitting any family to the PHA's public housing program. For each such family, the request must be submitted for each proposed household member described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (ii)  Under Policy B, the PHA must submit a request to a drug abuse treatment facility only with respect to each proposed household member:

      (A) Whose criminal record indicates prior arrest or conviction for any criminal activity that may be a basis for denial of admission under § 960.205; or

      (B) Whose prior tenancy records indicate that the proposed household member:

      (1) Engaged in the destruction of property;

      (2) Engaged in violent activity against another person; or

      (3) Interfered with the right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other residents.

      (4) The policy adopted by the PHA must be included in the PHA administrative plan and the PHA plan.

      (f)  Each PHA that receives information from a drug abuse treatment facility under this section must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any information which the PHA receives from the drug abuse treatment facility about a person:

      (1) Is maintained confidentially in accordance with section 543 of the Public Health Service Act (12 U.S.C. 290dd-2);

      (2) Is not misused or improperly disseminated; and

      (3) Is destroyed, as applicable:

      (i) Not later than 5 business days after the PHA makes a final decision to admit the person as a household member under the PHA's public housing program; or

      (ii) If the PHA denies the admission of such person as a household member, in a timely manner after the date on which the statute of limitations for the commencement of a civil action based upon that denial of admissions has expired without the filing of a civil action or until final disposition of any such litigation.

      § 960.206   Waiting list: Local preferences in admission to public housing program.

#### § § 960.206

      (a)  (1) The PHA may adopt a system of local preferences for selection of families admitted to the PHA's public housing program. The PHA system of selection preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities as determined by the PHA. In determining such needs and priorities, the PHA shall use generally accepted data sources. Such sources include public comment on the PHA plan (as received pursuant to § 903.17 of this chapter), and on the consolidated plan for the relevant jurisdiction (as received pursuant to part 91 of this title).

      (2) The PHA may limit the number of applicants that qualify for any local preference.

      (3) PHA adoption and implementation of local preferences is subject to HUD requirements concerning income-targeting (§ 960.202(b)), deconcentration and income-mixing (§ 903.7), and selection preferences for developments designated exclusively for elderly or disabled families or for mixed population developments (§ 960.407).

      (4) The PHA must inform all applicants about available preferences and must give applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for available preferences.

      (b) —(1)  (i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although a PHA is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the PHA may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title.

      (ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”). A county or municipality may be used as a residency preference area. An area smaller than a county or municipality may not be used as a residency preference area.

      (iii) Any PHA residency preferences must be included in the statement of PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admission to the program, which is included in the PHA annual plan (or supporting documents) pursuant to part 903 of this chapter. Such policies must specify that use of a residency preference will not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to the program based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.

      (iv) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.

      (v) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The PHA may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.

      (2)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families where the head, spouse, or sole member, is employed). However, an applicant must be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.

      (3)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the PHA may not adopt a preference for persons with a specific disability.

      (4)  The PHA should consider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

      (5)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.

      (6)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of non-public housing over-income families paying the alternative non-public housing rent and are on a NPHOI lease who become an income-eligible low-income family as defined in § 5.603(b) of this title and are eligible for admission to the public housing program.

      (c)  In selecting a family to occupy a particular unit, the PHA may match characteristics of the family with the type of unit available, for example, number of bedrooms. In selection of families to occupy units with special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the PHA must first offer such units to families which include persons with disabilities who require such accessibility features (see §§ 8.27 and 100.202 of this title).

      (d)  A single person who is not an elderly or displaced person, or a person with disabilities, or the remaining member of a resident family may not be provided a housing unit with two or more bedrooms.

      (e)  (1) The PHA must use the following to select among applicants on the waiting list with the same priority for admission:

      (i) Date and time of application; or

      (ii) A drawing or other random choice technique.

      (2) The method for selecting applicants must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that each applicant has been selected in accordance with the method specified in the PHA plan.

      § 960.208   Notification to applicants.

#### § § 960.208

      (a) The PHA must promptly notify any applicant determined to be ineligible for admission to a project of the basis for such determination, and must provide the applicant upon request, within a reasonable time after the determination is made, with an opportunity for an informal hearing on such determination.

      (b) When a determination has been made that an applicant is eligible and satisfies all requirements for admission, including the tenant selection criteria, the applicant must be notified of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as that date can be reasonably determined.

    Subpart C—Rent and Reexamination

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 16726, Mar. 29, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

      § 960.253   Choice of rent.

#### § § 960.253

      (a) —(1)  Once a year, the PHA must give each family the opportunity to choose between the two methods for determining the amount of tenant rent payable monthly by the family. The family may choose to pay as tenant rent either a flat rent as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or an income-based rent as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Except for financial hardship cases as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the family may not be offered this choice more than once a year.

      (2)  Regardless of whether the family chooses to pay a flat rent or income-based rent, the family must pay at least the minimum rent as determined in accordance with § 5.630 of this title.

      (3)  Non-public housing over-income families must pay the alternative non-public housing rent, as applicable, as determined in accordance with § 960.102.

      (b) . The flat rent is determined annually, based on the market rental value of the unit as determined by this paragraph (b).

      (1) The PHA must establish a flat rent for each public housing unit that is no less than 80 percent of the applicable Fair Market Rent (FMR) as determined under 24 CFR part 888, subpart A; or

      (2) HUD may permit a flat rent of no less than 80 percent of an applicable small area FMR (SAFMR) or unadjusted rent, if applicable, as determined by HUD, or any successor determination, that more accurately reflects local market conditions and is based on an applicable market area that is geographically smaller than the applicable market area used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If HUD has not determined an applicable SAFMR or unadjusted rent, the PHA must rely on the applicable FMR under paragraph (b)(1) or may apply for an exception flat rent under paragraph (b)(3).

      (3) The PHA may request, and HUD may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a flat rent that is lower than the amounts in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, subject to the following requirements:

      (i) The PHA must submit a market analysis of the applicable market.

      (ii) The PHA must demonstrate, based on the market analysis, that the proposed flat rent is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units, based on the location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the public housing unit and any amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the PHA in accordance with the lease.

      (iii) All requests for exception flat rents under this paragraph (b)(3) must be submitted to HUD.

      (4) For units where utilities are tenant-paid, the PHA must adjust the flat rent downward by the amount of a utility allowance for which the family might otherwise be eligible under 24 CFR part 965, subpart E.

      (5) The PHA must revise, if necessary, the flat rent amount for a unit no later than 90 days after HUD issues new FMRs.

      (6) If a new flat rent would cause a family's rent to increase by more than 35 percent, the family's rent increase must be phased in at 35 percent annually until such time that the family chooses to pay the income-based rent or the family is paying the flat rent established pursuant to this paragraph.

      (c)  (1) An income-based rent is a tenant rent that is based on the family's income and the PHA's policies for determination of such rents.

      (2) The PHA rent policies may specify that the PHA will use percentage of family income or some other reasonable system to determine income-based rents. The PHA rent policies may provide for depositing a portion of tenant rent in an escrow or savings account, for imposing a ceiling on tenant rents, for adoption of permissive income deductions (see § 5.611(b) of this title), or for another reasonable system to determining the amount of income-based tenant rent.

      (3) The income-based tenant rent must not exceed the total tenant payment (§ 5.628 of this title) for the family minus any applicable utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. If the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, the PHA shall pay such excess amount (the utility reimbursement) either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family.

      (4) The PHA may elect to establish policies regarding the frequency of utility reimbursement payments for payments made to the family.

      (i) The PHA will have the option of making utility reimbursement payments not less than once per calendar-year quarter, for reimbursements totaling $45 or less per quarter. In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the PHA must reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.

      (ii) If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier, the PHA must notify the family of the amount of utility reimbursement paid to the utility supplier.

      (d)  A PHA using ceiling rents authorized and established before October 1, 1999, may continue to use ceiling rents, provided such ceiling rents are set at the level required for flat rents under this section. PHAs must follow the requirements for calculating and adjusting flat rents in paragraph (b) of this section when calculating and adjusting ceiling rents.

      (e)  For the family to make an informed choice about its rent options, the PHA must provide sufficient information for an informed choice. Such information must include at least the following written information:

      (1) The PHA's policies on switching type of rent in circumstances of financial hardship, and

      (2) The dollar amounts of tenant rent for the family under each option, following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (f)  Families must be offered the choice between a flat rental amount and a previously calculated income-based rent according to the following:

      (1) For a family that chooses the flat rent option, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least once every three years, except for families a PHA determines exceed the over-income limit described in § 960.507(b). Once a PHA determines that a family has an income exceeding the over-income limit, the PHA must follow the income examination and notification requirements under § 960.507(c).

      (2) At initial occupancy, or in any year in which a participating family is paying the income-based rent, the PHA must:

      (i) Conduct a full examination of family income and composition, following the provisions in § 960.257;

      (ii) Inform the family of the flat rental amount and the income-based rental amount determined by the examination of family income and composition;

      (iii) Inform the family of the PHA's policies on switching rent types in circumstances of financial hardship; and

      (iv) Apply the family's rent decision at the next lease renewal.

      (3) In any year in which a family chooses the flat rent option but the PHA chooses not to conduct a full examination of family income and composition for the annual rent option under the authority of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the PHA must:

      (i) Use income information from the examination of family income and composition from the first annual rent option;

      (ii) Inform the family of the updated flat rental amount and the rental amount determined by the most recent examination of family income and composition;

      (iii) Inform the family of the PHA's policies on switching rent types in circumstances of financial hardship; and

      (iv) Apply the family's rent decision at the next lease renewal.

      (g)  (1) A family that is paying a flat rent may at any time request a switch to payment of income-based rent (before the next annual option to select the type of rent) if the family is unable to pay flat rent because of financial hardship. The PHA must adopt written policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship for the family.

      (2) If the PHA determines that the family is unable to pay the flat rent because of financial hardship, the PHA must immediately allow the requested switch to income-based rent. The PHA shall make the determination within a reasonable time after the family request.

      (3) The PHA policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship must provide that financial hardship include the following situations:

      (i) The family has experienced a decrease in income because of changed circumstances, including loss or reduction of employment, death in the family, or reduction in or loss of earnings or other assistance;

      (ii) The family has experienced an increase in expenses, because of changed circumstances, for medical costs, child care, transportation, education, or similar items; and

      (iii) Such other situations determined by the PHA to be appropriate.

      § 960.255   Self-sufficiency incentives—Disallowance of increase in annual income.

#### § § 960.255

      (a)  The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

      The annual income immediately prior to implementation of the disallowance described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section of a person who is a member of a qualified family.

      Exclusion from annual income.

      includes a person who has earned, in the twelve months previous to employment, no more than would be received for 10 hours of work per week for 50 weeks at the established minimum wage.

      A family residing in public housing:

      (i) Whose annual income increases as a result of employment of a family member who was unemployed for one or more years previous to employment;

      (ii) Whose annual income increases as a result of increased earnings by a family member during participation in any economic self-sufficiency or other job training program; or

      (iii) Whose annual income increases, as a result of new employment or increased earnings of a family member, during or within six months after receiving assistance, benefits or services under any state program for temporary assistance for needy families funded under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act, as determined by the PHA in consultation with the local agencies administering temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) and Welfare-to-Work (WTW) programs. The TANF program is not limited to monthly income maintenance, but also includes such benefits and services as one-time payments, wage subsidies and transportation assistance—provided that the total amount over a six-month period is at least $500.

      (b) —(1)  During the 12-month period beginning on the date on which a member of a qualified family is first employed or the family first experiences an increase in annual income attributable to employment, the PHA must exclude from the annual income (as defined in § 5.609 of this title) of a qualified family any increase in the income of the family member as a result of employment over the baseline income of that family member.

      (2)  Upon the expiration of the 12-month period defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for the subsequent 12-month period, the PHA must exclude from the annual income of a qualified family at least 50 percent of any increase in income of such family member as a result of employment over the family member's baseline income.

      (3)  The disallowance of increased income of an individual family member as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is limited to a lifetime 24-month period. It applies for a maximum of 12 months for disallowance under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a maximum of 12 months for disallowance under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, during the 24-month period starting from the initial exclusion under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (4) Effect of changes on currently participating families. Families eligible for and participating in the disallowance of earned income under this section prior to May 9, 2016 will continue to be governed by this section in effect as it existed immediately prior to that date.

      (c)  The disallowance of increases in income as a result of employment under this section does not apply for purposes of admission to the program (including the determination of income eligibility and income targeting).

      (d)  As an alternative to the disallowance of increases in income as a result of employment described in paragraph (b) of this section, a PHA may choose to provide for individual savings accounts for public housing residents who pay an income-based rent, in accordance with a written policy, which must include the following provisions:

      (1) The PHA must advise the family that the savings account option is available;

      (2) At the option of the family, the PHA must deposit in the savings account the total amount that would have been included in tenant rent payable to the PHA as a result of increased income that is disallowed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;

      (3) Amounts deposited in a savings account may be withdrawn only for the purpose of:

      (i) Purchasing a home;

      (ii) Paying education costs of family members;

      (iii) Moving out of public or assisted housing; or

      (iv) Paying any other expense authorized by the PHA for the purpose of promoting the economic self-sufficiency of residents of public housing;

      (4) The PHA must maintain the account in an interest bearing investment and must credit the family with the net interest income, and the PHA may not charge a fee for maintaining the account;

      (5) At least annually the PHA must provide the family with a report on the status of the account; and

      (6) If the family moves out of public housing, the PHA shall pay the tenant any balance in the account, minus any amounts owed to the PHA.

      (e)  This section applies to a family that is:

      (1) Receiving the disallowance of earned income under this section on December 31, 2023 or

      (2) Eligible to receive the Jobs Plus program rent incentive pursuant to the Jobs Plus FY2023 notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) or earlier appropriations and distributed through prior Jobs Plus NOFOs.

      (f)  This section will lapse on January 1, 2030.

      § 960.257   Family income and composition: Annual and interim reexaminations.

#### § § 960.257

      (a)  (1) For families who pay an income-based rent, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least annually and must make appropriate adjustments in the rent after consultation with the family and upon verification of the information.

      (2) For families who choose flat rents, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family composition at least annually, and must conduct a reexamination of family income at least once every three years in accordance with the procedures in § 960.253(f).

      (3) For all families who include nonexempt individuals, as defined in § 960.601, the PHA must determine compliance once each twelve months with community service and self-sufficiency requirements in subpart F of this part.

      (4) The PHA may use the results of these reexaminations to require the family to move to an appropriate size unit.

      (5) For all non-public housing over-income families, the PHA may not conduct an annual reexamination of family income.

      (b)  (1) A family may request an interim reexamination of family income or composition because of any changes since the last determination. The PHA must conduct any interim reexamination within a reasonable period of time after the family request or when the PHA becomes aware of an increase in family adjusted income under paragraph (3) of this section. What qualifies as a “reasonable time” may vary based on the amount of time it takes to verify information, but generally should not be longer than 30 days after changes in income are reported.

      (2) The PHA may decline to conduct an interim reexamination of family income if the PHA estimates the family's adjusted income will decrease by an amount that is less than ten percent of the family's annual adjusted income (or a lower amount established by HUD by notice), or a lower threshold established by the PHA.

      (3) The PHA must conduct an interim reexamination of family income when the PHA becomes aware that the family's adjusted income (as defined in § 5.611 of this title) has changed by an amount that the PHA estimates will result in an increase of ten percent or more in annual adjusted income or such other amount established by HUD through notice, except:

      (i) The PHA may not consider any increase in the earned income of the family when estimating or calculating whether the family's adjusted income has increased, except that, based on the PHA's established written policy, the PHA may consider increases in earned income if the PHA has processed an interim reexamination for a decrease in the family's income under paragraph (b)(1) of this section within the same annual or biennial reexamination cycle; and

      (ii) The PHA may choose not to conduct an interim reexamination in the last three months of a family's certification period, in accordance with the PHA's established written policy.

      (4) For over-income families in the period of up to six months before their tenancy termination pursuant to § 960.507(d)(2), the PHA must conduct an interim reexamination of family income as otherwise required under this paragraph. However, the resulting income determination will not make the family eligible to remain in the public housing program beyond the period before termination as defined by PHA policy.

      (5) The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.

      (6)  (i) If the family has reported a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, the PHA must provide the family with 30 days advance notice of any rent increases, and such rent increases will be effective the first day of the month beginning after the end of that 30-day period. Rent decreases will be effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the actual change leading to the interim reexamination of family income.

      (ii) If the family has failed to report a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, PHAs must implement any resulting rent increases retroactively to the first of the month following the date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income. Any resulting rent decrease must be implemented no later than the first rent period following completion of the reexamination. However, a PHA may apply rent decreases retroactively at the discretion of the PHA, in accordance with the conditions established by the PHA in written policy and subject to paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.

      (iii) A retroactive rent decrease may not be applied by the PHA prior to the later of the first of the month following:

      (A) The date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income; or

      (B) The effective date of the family's most recent previous interim or annual reexamination (or initial examination if that was the family's last examination).

      (c) —(1)  A PHA may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

      (2)  For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:

      (i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.

      (ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.

      (iii) Annuities or other retirement benefit programs, insurance policies, disability or death benefits, or other similar types of periodic receipts.

      (iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.

      (3)  A PHA using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.

      (i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's sources of fixed income, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, the PHA is not required to make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income individually. The PHA must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (4)  PHAs using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.

      (5)  For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, a PHA must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.

      (d)  The PHA must adopt admission and continued occupancy policies concerning conduct of annual and interim reexaminations in accordance with this section, and shall conduct reexaminations in accordance with such policies. The PHA reexamination policies must be in accordance with the PHA plan.

      (e) Reviews of family income under this section are subject to the provisions in section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3544).

      (f)  The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income varies from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).

      (i) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their rent as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Families will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for rent or family share.

      (ii) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (f) through a rulemaking published in the  for public comment.

      § 960.259   Family information and verification.

#### § § 960.259

      (a)  (1) The family must supply any information that the PHA or HUD determines is necessary in administration of the public housing program, including submission of required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status (as provided by part 5, subpart E of this title). “Information” includes any requested certification, release or other documentation.

      (2) The family must supply any information requested by the PHA or HUD for use in a regularly scheduled reexamination or an interim reexamination of family income and composition in accordance with HUD requirements.

      (3) For requirements concerning the following, see part 5, subpart B of this title:

      (i) Family verification and disclosure of social security numbers;

      (ii) Family execution and submission of consent forms for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (SWICAs).

      (4) Any information supplied by the family must be true and complete.

      (b)  (1) As a condition of admission to or continued assistance under the program, the PHA shall require the family head, and such other family members as the PHA designates, to execute a consent form (including any release and consent as required under § 5.230 of this title) authorizing any depository or private source of income, or any Federal, State or local agency, to furnish or release to the PHA or HUD such information as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary.

      (2) The use or disclosure of information obtained from a family or from another source pursuant to this release and consent shall be limited to purposes directly connected with administration of the program.

      (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PHA must obtain and document in the family file third-party verification of the following factors, or must document in the file why third-party verification was not available:

      (i) Reported family annual income;

      (ii) The value of assets;

      (iii) Expenses related to deductions from annual income; and

      (iv) Other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income or income-based rent.

      (2) For a family with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.

    Subpart E—Occupancy by Over-Income Families or Police Officers

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 16729, Mar. 29, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

      § 960.503   Occupancy by over-income families.

#### § § 960.503

      A PHA that owns or operates fewer than two hundred fifty (250) public housing units, may lease a unit in a public housing development to an over-income family (a family whose annual income exceeds the limit for a low income family at the time of initial occupancy), in accordance with its PHA annual plan (or supporting documents), if all the following conditions are satisfied:

      (a) There are no eligible low income families on the PHA waiting list or applying for public housing assistance when the unit is leased to an over-income family;

      (b) The PHA has publicized availability of the unit for rental to eligible low income families, including publishing public notice of such availability in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction at least thirty days before offering the unit to an over-income family;

      (c) The over-income family rents the unit on a month-to-month basis for a rent that is not less than the PHA's cost to operate the unit;

      (d) The lease to the over-income family provides that the family agrees to vacate the unit when needed for rental to an eligible family; and

      (e) The PHA gives the over-income family at least thirty days notice to vacate the unit when the unit is needed for rental to an eligible family.

      § 960.505   Occupancy by police officers to provide security for public housing residents.

#### § § 960.505

      (a)  For purpose of this subpart E, “police officer” means a person determined by the PHA to be, during the period of residence of that person in public housing, employed on a full-time basis as a duly licensed professional police officer by a Federal, State or local government or by any agency of these governments. An officer of an accredited police force of a housing agency may qualify.

      (b)  For the purpose of increasing security for residents of a public housing development, the PHA may allow police officers who would not otherwise be eligible for occupancy in public housing, to reside in a public housing dwelling unit. The PHA must include in the PHA annual plan or supporting documents the number and location of the units to be occupied by police officers, and the terms and conditions of their tenancies; and a statement that such occupancy is needed to increase security for public housing residents.

      § 960.507   Families exceeding the income limit.

#### § § 960.507

      (a)  Families participating in the public housing program must not have incomes that exceed the over-income limit, as determined by paragraph (b) of this section, for more than 24 consecutive months.

      (1) This provision applies to all families in the public housing program, including FSS families and all families receiving EID.

      (i) Mixed families (as defined in § 5.504 of this title) who are non-public housing over-income families pay the alternative non-public housing rent (as defined in § 960.102), as applicable.

      (ii) All non-public housing over-income families are precluded from participating in a public housing resident council.

      (iii) Furthermore, non-public housing over-income families cannot participate in programs that are only for public housing or low-income families.

      (iv) PHAs cannot provide any Federal assistance, including a utility allowance, to non-public housing over-income families.

      (2) PHAs must implement the requirements of this section by amending all applicable admission and continued occupancy policies according to the provisions in 24 CFR part 903. All PHAs must have effective over-income policies, consistent with the requirements of this section, no later than June 14, 2023.

      (b)  The over-income limit is determined by multiplying the applicable income limit for a very low-income family as defined in § 5.603(b) of this title, by a factor of 2.4.

      (c)  (1) If the PHA determines the family has exceeded the over-income limit pursuant to an income examination, the PHA must provide written notice to the family of the over-income determination no later than 30 days after the income examination. The notice must state that the family has exceeded the over-income limit and continuing to exceed the over-income limit for a total of 24 consecutive months will result in the PHA following its continued occupancy policy for over-income families in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Pursuant to 24 CFR part 966, subpart B, the PHA must afford the family an opportunity for a hearing if the family disputes within a reasonable time the PHA's determination that the family has exceeded the over-income limit.

      (2) The PHA must conduct an income examination 12 months after the initial over-income determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the PHA determined the family's income fell below the over-income limit since the initial over-income determination. If the PHA determines the family has exceeded the over-income limit for 12 consecutive months, the PHA must provide written notification of this 12-month over-income determination no later than 30 days after the income examination that led to the 12-month over-income determination. The notice must state that the family has exceeded the over-income limit for 12 consecutive months and continuing to exceed the over-income limit for a total of 24 consecutive months will result in the PHA following its continued occupancy policy for over-income families in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Additionally, if applicable under PHA policy, the notice must include an estimate (based on current data) of the alternative non-public housing rent for the family's unit. Pursuant to 24 CFR part 966, subpart B, the PHA must afford the family an opportunity for a hearing if the family disputes within a reasonable time the PHA's determination that the family has exceeded the over-income limit.

      (3) The PHA must conduct an income examination 24 months after the initial over-income determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the PHA determined the family's income fell below the over-income limit since the second over-income determination. If the PHA determines the family has exceeded the over-income limit for 24 consecutive months, then the PHA must provide written notification of this 24-month over-income determination no later than 30 days after the income examination that led to the 24-month over-income determination. The notice must state:

      (i) That the family has exceeded the over-income limit for 24 consecutive months.

      (ii) That the PHA must either terminate the family's tenancy or charge the family the alternative non-public housing rent, in accordance with it continued occupancy policy for over-income families in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (A) If the PHA determines that under its policy the family's tenancy must be terminated in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the notice must inform the family of this determination and state the period of time before tenancy termination.

      (B) If the PHA determines that under its policy the family must be charged the alternative non-public housing rent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then the notice must inform the family of this determination and state that the family be charged the alternative non-public housing rent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The PHA must also present the family with a new lease, in accordance with the requirements at § 960.509, and inform the family that the lease must be executed no later than 60 days of the date of the notice or at the next lease renewal, whichever is sooner.

      (iii) Pursuant to 24 CFR part 966, subpart B, the PHA must afford the family an opportunity for a hearing if the family disputes within a reasonable time the PHA's determination that the family has exceeded the over-income limit.

      (4) If, at any time during the consecutive 24-month period following the initial over-income determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a PHA determines that the family's income is below the over-income limit, the family is entitled to a new 24 consecutive month period of being over-income and new notices under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section if the PHA later determines that the family income exceeds the over-income limit.

      (d)  Once a family has exceeded the over-income limit for 24 consecutive months, the PHA must, as detailed in its admissions and continued occupancy policies—

      (1) Require the family to execute a new lease consistent with § 960.509 and charge the family the alternative non-public housing rent, as defined in § 960.102, no later than 60-days after the notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section or at the next lease renewal, whichever is sooner; or

      (2) Terminate the tenancy of the family no more than 6 months after the notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section as determined by the PHA's continued occupancy policy. PHAs must continue to charge these families the family's choice of income-based, flat rent, or prorated rent for mixed families during the period before termination. The PHA must give appropriate notice of lease tenancy termination (notice to vacate) in accordance with State and local laws.

      (e)  An over-income family will continue to be a public housing program participant until their tenancy is terminated by the PHA in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the family executes a new non-public housing lease in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (f)  Each PHA must submit a report annually to HUD that specifies, as of the end of the year, the number of families residing in public housing with incomes exceeding the over-income limit and the number of families on the waiting lists for admission to public housing projects and provide any other information regarding over-income families requested by HUD. These reports must also be publicly available.

      § 960.509   Lease requirements for non-public housing over-income families.

#### § § 960.509

      (a)  If a family, when permitted by written PHA's continued occupancy policy, elects to remain in a public housing unit paying the alternative non-public housing rent, the PHA and each non-public housing over-income (NPHOI) family (referred to as the “tenant” in this section) must enter into a lease. The tenant and the PHA must execute the lease, as presented by the PHA pursuant to § 960.507(c)(3)(ii)(B) no later than 60 days after the notice provided pursuant to § 960.507(c)(3) or at the next lease renewal, whichever is sooner. If the tenant does not execute the lease within this time period, the PHA must terminate the tenancy of the tenant no more than 6 months after the notification under § 960.507(c)(3) in accordance with 960.507(d)(2). Notwithstanding, a PHA may permit, in accordance with its policies, an over-income family to execute the lease beyond this time period, but before termination of the tenancy, if the over-income family pays the PHA the total difference between the alternative non-public housing rent and their public housing rent dating back to the point in time that the over-income family was required to execute the lease.

      (b)  The non-public housing over-income lease must contain at a minimum the following provisions.

      (1)  The lease must state:

      (i) The name of the PHA and names of the tenants.

      (ii) The unit rented (address, apartment number, and any other information needed to identify the dwelling unit).

      (iii) The term of the lease (lease term and renewal in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

The family must promptly inform the PHA of the birth, adoption, or court-awarded custody of a child. The family must request PHA approval to add any other family member as an occupant of the unit.

      (2)  (i) The lease must have a term as determined by the PHA and included in PHA policy.

      (ii) At any time, the PHA may terminate the tenancy in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section.

      (3)  (i)  (A) The tenant must pay the amount of the monthly tenant rent determined by the PHA in accordance with § 960.507(e)(1).

      (B) The lease must specify the initial amount of the tenant rent at the beginning of the initial lease term. The PHA must comply with State or local law in giving the tenant written notice stating any change in the amount of tenant rent.

      (ii)  The lease must provide for charges to the tenant for repair beyond normal wear and tear and for consumption of excess utilities. The lease must state the basis for the determination of such charges ( by a posted schedule of charges for repair, amounts charged for excess utility consumption, etc.). The imposition of charges for consumption of excess utilities is permissible only if such charges are determined by an individual check meter servicing the leased unit or result from the use of major tenant-supplied appliances.

      (iii)  The lease may provide for penalties for late payment of rent.

      (iv)  The lease must provide that charges assessed under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section are due in accordance with PHA policy.

      (v)  The lease must provide that any previously paid security deposit will be applied to the tenancy upon signing a new lease. The lease must also inform the tenant of the circumstances under which a security deposit will be returned to the tenant or when the tenant will be charged for damage to the unit, consistent with State and local security deposit laws.

      (4)  The lease must provide that the tenant has the right to exclusive use and occupancy of the leased unit by the members of the household authorized to reside in the unit in accordance with the lease, as well as their _guest_s. The term  is defined in § 5.100 of this title.

      (5)  The PHA's obligations under the lease must include the following:

      (i) To maintain the dwelling unit and the project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition.

      (ii) To comply with requirements of applicable State and local building codes, housing codes, and HUD regulations materially affecting health and safety.

      (iii) To make necessary repairs to the dwelling unit.

      (iv) To keep project buildings, facilities, and common areas, not otherwise assigned to the tenant for maintenance and upkeep, in a clean and safe condition.

      (vii) To supply running water, including an adequate source of potable water, and reasonable amounts of hot water and reasonable amounts of heat at appropriate times of the year (according to local custom and usage), except where the building that includes the dwelling unit is not required by law to be equipped for that purpose, or where heat or hot water is generated by an installation within the exclusive control of the tenant and supplied by a direct utility connection.

      (viii) To notify the tenant of the specific grounds for any proposed adverse action by the PHA as required by State and local law.

      (ix) To comply with Federal, State, and local nondiscrimination and fair housing requirements, including Federal accessibility requirements and providing reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.

      (ii) Not provide accommodations for boarders or lodgers.

      (iii) Use the dwelling unit solely as a private dwelling for the tenant and the tenant's household as identified in the lease, and not use or permit its use for any other purpose.

      (iv) Abide by necessary and reasonable policies established by the PHA for the benefit and well-being of the housing project and the tenants, which must be posted in the project office and incorporated by reference in the lease.

      (v) Comply with all applicable State and local building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety.

      (vi) Keep the dwelling unit and such other areas as may be assigned to the tenant for the tenant's exclusive use in a clean and safe condition.

      (x) Pay reasonable charges (other than for wear and tear) for the repair of damages to the dwelling unit, or to the housing project (including damages to buildings, facilities, or common areas) caused by the tenant, a member of the household or a guest.

      (xi) Act, and cause household members and guests to act, in a manner which will not disturb other residents' peaceful enjoyment of their accommodations and will be conducive to maintaining the project in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.

      (xii) Assure that no tenant, member of the tenant's household, guest, or any other person under the tenant's control engages in:

      (A)  () Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (B)  For non-public housing over-income units that are not within mixed-finance projects, any smoking of prohibited tobacco products in the tenant's unit as well as restricted areas, as defined by § 965.653(a) of this chapter, or in other outdoor areas that the PHA has designated as smoke-free.

      (xiii) To assure that no member of the household engages in an abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol that affects the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (7)  The lease may provide that the tenant must perform seasonal maintenance or other maintenance tasks, where performance of such tasks by tenants of dwellings units of a similar design and construction is customary, as long as such provisions are not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the PHA. In cases where a PHA adopts such lease provisions, the PHA must exempt tenants who are unable to perform such tasks because of age or disability.

      (8)  The lease must set forth the rights and obligations of the tenant and the PHA if to the dwelling unit is damaged to the extent that conditions are created which are hazardous to life, health, or safety of the occupants. The lease must provide that:

      (i) The tenant must immediately notify project management of the damage.

      (ii) The PHA must repair the unit within a reasonable time. The PHA must charge the tenant the reasonable cost of the repairs if the damage was caused by the tenant, the tenant's household, or the tenant's guests.

      (iii) The PHA must offer standard alternative accommodations, if available, where necessary repairs cannot be made within a reasonable time, subject to paragraph (b)(5)(ix) of this section; and

      (iv) The lease must allow for abatement of rent in proportion to the seriousness of the damage and loss in value as a dwelling if repairs are not made in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section or alternative accommodations not provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section, except that no abatement of rent may occur if the tenant rejects the alternative accommodation or if the damage was caused by the tenant, tenant's household or guests.

      (9)  The lease must set forth the circumstances under which the PHA may enter the dwelling unit during the tenant's possession and must include the following requirements:

      (i) The PHA is, upon reasonable advance notification to the tenant, permitted to enter the dwelling unit during reasonable hours for the purpose of performing routine inspections and maintenance, for making improvement or repairs, or to show the dwelling unit for re-leasing. A written statement specifying the purpose of the PHA entry delivered to the dwelling unit at least two days before such entry is reasonable advance notification.

      (ii) The PHA may enter the dwelling unit at any time without advance notification when there is reasonable cause to believe that an emergency exists; and

      (iii) If the tenant and all adult members of the household are absent from the dwelling unit at the time of entry, the PHA must leave in the dwelling unit a written statement specifying the date, time, and purpose of entry prior to leaving the dwelling unit.

      (10)  The lease must provide procedures, in accordance with State and local laws, the PHA and tenant must follow when giving notices, which must include:

      (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(9) of this section, notice to a tenant must be provided in a form to allow meaningful access for persons who are limited English proficient and, in a form, to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities; and

      (ii) Notice to the PHA can be in writing, hand delivered, or sent by prepaid first-class mail to PHA address provided in the lease, orally, or submitted electronically through a communications system established by the PHA for that purpose.

      (11)  (i)  The lease must state the procedures to be followed by the PHA and the tenant to terminate the tenancy.

      (ii)  The PHA must terminate the tenancy for good cause, which includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      (A) Criminal activity or alcohol abuse as provided in paragraph (b)(11)(iv) of this section.

      (B) Failure to accept the PHA's offer of a lease revision to an existing lease: with written notice of the offer of the revision at least 60 calendar days before the lease revision is scheduled to take effect; and with the offer specifying a reasonable time limit within that period for acceptance by the family.

      (iii)  The PHA must give notice of lease termination in accordance with State and local laws.

      (iv)  (A)  ()  The PHA must immediately terminate the tenancy if the PHA determines that any member of the household has been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of Federally assisted housing.

      ()  The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or off the premises by any tenant, member of the tenant's household or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the PHA to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that a PHA may evict a family when the PHA determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the PHA determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (B)  ()  The lease must provide that any criminal activity by a covered person that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents (including PHA management staff residing on the premises) or threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises is grounds for termination of tenancy.

      ()  The PHA may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.

      (C)  ()  The PHA may evict the tenant by judicial action for criminal activity in accordance with this section if the PHA determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction.

      ()  When a PHA evicts an individual or family for criminal activity, the PHA must notify the local post office serving the dwelling unit that the individual or family is no longer residing in the unit.

      (D)  If the PHA seeks to terminate the tenancy for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record before a PHA grievance hearing, as applicable, or court trial concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant must be given an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in the grievance hearing or court trial.

      (E)  The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.

      (F)  The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of tenancy if the PHA determines that a household member has:

      () Engaged in abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or

      () Furnished false or misleading information concerning illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, or rehabilitation of illegal drug users or alcohol abusers.

      (G)  ()  In a manner consistent with policies, procedures and practices, the PHA may consider all circumstances relevant to a particular case such as the nature and severity of the offending action, the extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action, the effects that the eviction would have on family members not involved in the offending activity, the extent to which the leaseholder has taken steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action, the amount of time that has passed since the criminal conduct occurred, whether the crime or conviction was related to a disability, and whether the individual has engaged in rehabilitative or community services.

      ()  The PHA may require a tenant to exclude a household member to continue to reside in the dwelling unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.

      ()  In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use, or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 1_3_662). For this purpose, the PHA may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.

      ()  The PHA's eviction actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of § 5.105 of this title.

      (12)  Upon expiration of the lease term, the lease shall not automatically renew.

      (13)  The lease may include hearing or grievance procedures and may explain when the procedures are available to the family.

      (14)  The lease may be modified at any time by written agreement of the tenant and the PHA. The lease must provide that modification of the lease must be evidenced by a written rider or amendment to the lease, executed by both parties, except as permitted under § 966.5 of this chapter, which allows modifications of the lease by posting of policies, rules and regulations.

      (15)  The lease must provide a signature clause attesting that the lease has been executed by the parties.

      § 960.603   General requirements.

#### § § 960.603

      (a)  Except for any family member who is an exempt individual, each adult resident of public housing must:

      (1) Contribute 8 hours per month of community service (not including political activities); or

      (2) Participate in an economic self-sufficiency program for 8 hours per month; or

      (3) Perform 8 hours per month of combined activities as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

      (b)  The lease shall specify that it shall be renewed automatically for all purposes, unless the family fails to comply with the service requirement. Violation of the service requirement is grounds for nonrenewal of the lease at the end of the twelve month lease term, but not for termination of tenancy during the course of the twelve month lease term (see § 966.4(l)(2)(i) of this chapter).

      § 960.605   How PHA administers service requirements.

#### § § 960.605

      (a)  Each PHA must develop a local policy for administration of the community service and economic self-sufficiency requirements for public housing residents.

      (b)  The PHA may administer qualifying community service or economic self-sufficiency activities directly, or may make such activities available through a contractor, or through partnerships with qualified organizations, including resident organizations, and community agencies or institutions.

      (c)  (1) The PHA policy must describe how the PHA determines which family members are subject to or exempt from the service requirement, and the process for determining any changes to exempt or non-exempt status of family members.

      (2) The PHA must give the family a written description of the service requirement, and of the process for claiming status as an exempt person and for PHA verification of such status. The PHA must also notify the family of its determination identifying the family members who are subject to the service requirement, and the family members who are exempt persons. The PHA must also notify the family that it will be validating a sample of self-certifications of completion of the service requirement accepted by the PHA under § 960.607(a)(1)(ii).

      (3) The PHA must review family compliance with service requirements and must verify such compliance annually at least 30 days before the end of the 12-month lease term. If qualifying activities are administered by an organization other than the PHA, the PHA may obtain verification of family compliance from such third parties or may accept a signed certification from the family member that he or she has performed such qualifying activities.

      (4) The PHA must retain reasonable documentation of service requirement performance or exemption in a participant family's files.

      (5) The PHA must comply with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title and affirmatively further fair housing in all their activities in accordance with the AFFH Certification as described in § 903.7(o) of this chapter.

      (i) A signed certification to the PHA by such other organization that the family member has performed such qualifying activities; or

      (ii) A signed self-certification to the PHA by the family member that he or she has performed such qualifying activities.

      (2) The signed self-certification must include the following:

      (i) A statement that the tenant contributed at least 8 hours per month of community service not including political activities within the community in which the adult resides; or participated in an economic self-sufficiency program (as that term is defined in 24 CFR 5.603(b)) for at least 8 hours per month;

      (ii) The name, address, and a contact person at the community service provider; or the name, address, and contact person for the economic self-sufficiency program;

      (iii) The date(s) during which the tenant completed the community service activity, or participated in the economic self-sufficiency program;

      (iv) A description of the activity completed; and

      (v) A certification that the tenant's statement is true.

      (3) If a PHA accepts self-certifications under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the PHA must validate a sample of such self-certifications using third-party certification described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

      (b)  (1) If the PHA determines that there is a family member who is required to fulfill a service requirement, but who has violated this family obligation (noncompliant resident), the PHA must notify the tenant of this determination.

      (2) The PHA notice to the tenant must:

      (i) Briefly describe the noncompliance;

      (ii) State that the PHA will not renew the lease at the end of the twelve month lease term unless:

      (A) The tenant, and any other noncompliant resident, enter into a written agreement with the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA, to cure such noncompliance, and in fact cure such noncompliance in accordance with such agreement; or

      (B) The family provides written assurance satisfactory to the PHA that the tenant or other noncompliant resident no longer resides in the unit.

      (iii) State that the tenant may request a grievance hearing on the PHA determination, in accordance with part 966, subpart B of this chapter, and that the tenant may exercise any available judicial remedy to seek timely redress for the PHA's nonrenewal of the lease because of such determination.

      (c)  If the tenant or another family member has violated the service requirement, the PHA may not renew the lease upon expiration of the term unless:

      (1) The tenant, and any other noncompliant resident, enter into a written agreement with the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA, to cure such noncompliance by completing the additional hours of community service or economic self-sufficiency activity needed to make up the total number of hours required over the twelve-month term of the new lease, and

      (2) All other members of the family who are subject to the service requirement are currently complying with the service requirement or are no longer residing in the unit.

      § 960.609   Prohibition against replacement of PHA employees.

#### § § 960.609

      In implementing the service requirement under this subpart, the PHA may not substitute community service or self-sufficiency activities performed by residents for work ordinarily performed by PHA employees, or replace a job at any location where residents perform activities to satisfy the service requirement.

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 43636, Aug. 24, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 964.1   Purpose.

#### § § 964.1

      The purpose of this part is to recognize the importance of resident involvement in creating a positive living environment and in actively participating in the overall mission of public housing.

      § 964.3   Applicability and scope.

#### § § 964.3

      (a) The policies and procedures contained in this part apply to any PHA that has a Public Housing Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD. This part, except for subpart E, does not apply to PHAs with housing assistance payments contracts with HUD under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.

      (b) Subpart B of this part contains HUD policies, procedures, and requirements for the participation of residents in public housing operations. These policies, procedures, and requirements apply to all residents participating under this part.

      (c)(1) Subpart C of this part contains HUD policies, procedures, and requirements for residents participating in the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) (replaces the Resident Management Program under Section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937). Resident management in public housing is viable and remains an option under TOP.

      (2) Subpart C of this part is not intended to negate any pre-existing arrangements for resident management in public housing between a PHA and a resident management corporation. On or after September 23, 1994, any new, renewed or renegotiated contracts must meet the requirements of this part, the ACC and all applicable laws and regulations.

      (d) Subpart D of this part includes requirements for the Family Investment Centers (FIC) Program which was established by Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) to provide families living in public housing and Indian housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities.

      (e) Subpart E of this part implements section 2(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437), which provides for resident membership on the board of directors or similar governing body of a PHA. Subpart E applies to any public housing agency that has a public housing annual contributions contract with HUD or administers tenant-based rental under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).

      (f) The term “resident,” as used throughout this part, is interchangeable with the term “tenant,” to reflect the fact that local resident organizations have differing preferences for the terms. Terms such as “resident council” and “tenant council” and “resident management” and “tenant management” are interchangeable. Hereafter, for ease of discussion, the rule will use the terms resident, resident council and resident management corporation, as appropriate.

      § 964.7   Definitions.

#### § § 964.7

      A contract (in the form prescribed by HUD) under which HUD agrees to provide financial assistance, and the HA agrees to comply with HUD requirements for the development and operation of the public housing project.

      A participating resident of a participating HA. If the HA is combining FIC with the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, the term also means Public Housing FSS and Section 8 families participating in the FSS program. Although Section 8 FSS families are eligible residents for FIC, they do not qualify for income exclusions that are provided for public housing residents participating in employment and supportive service programs.

      A facility on or near public housing which provides families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence.

      Any person who is responsible for:

      (1) Determining the eligibility and assessing needs of families to be served by the FIC;

      (2) Assessing training and service needs of eligible residents;

      (3) Working with service providers to coordinate the provision of services on a HA-wide or less than HA-wide basis, and to tailor the services to the needs and characteristics of eligible residents;

      (4) Mobilizing public and private resources to ensure that the supportive services identified can be funded over the five-year period, at least, following the initial receipt of funding.

      (5) Monitoring and evaluating the delivery, impact, and effectiveness of any supportive service funded with capital or operating assistance under the FIC program;

      (6) Coordinating the development and implementation of the FIC program with other self-sufficiency programs, and other education and employment programs; and

      (7) Performing other duties and functions that are appropriate for providing eligible residents with better access to educational and employment opportunities.

      means the same as

      All activities for which the HA is responsible to HUD under the ACC, within the definition of “operation” under the Act and the ACC, including the development of resident programs and services.

      A written agreement between a resident management corporation and a HA, as provided by subpart C.

      is defined in 24 CFR part 5.

      The term “development” has the same meaning as that provided for “low-income housing project” as that term is defined Section 3(b)(1) of the Act.

      The performance of one or more management activities for one or more projects by a resident management corporation under a management contract with the HA.

      An entity that proposes to enter into, or enters into, a contract to manage one or more management activities of a HA.

      Any business concern which is owned and controlled by public housing residents. (The term “resident-owned business” includes sole proprietorships.) For purposes of this part, “owned and controlled” means a business:

      (1) Which is at least 51 percent owned by one or more public housing residents; and

      (2) Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more such individuals.

      New or significantly expanded services that are essential to providing families living with children in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence.

      The TOP program is designed to prepare residents to experience the dignity of meaningful work, to own and operate resident businesses, to move toward financial independence, and to enable them to choose where they want to live and engage in meaningful participation in the management of housing developments in which they live. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is available to RCs/RMCs to prepare to manage activities in their public housing developments.

      A dwelling unit that is not under an effective lease to an eligible family. An effective lease is a lease under which an eligible family has a right to possession of the unit and is being charged rent, even if the amount of any utility allowance equals or exceeds the amount of a total resident payment that is based on income and, as a result, the amount paid by the family to the HA is zero.

      § 964.11   HUD policy on tenant participation.

#### § § 964.11

      HUD promotes resident participation and the active involvement of residents in all aspects of a HA's overall mission and operation. Residents have a right to organize and elect a resident council to represent their interests. As long as proper procedures are followed, the HA shall recognize the duly elected resident council to participate fully through a working relationship with the HA. HUD encourages HAs and residents to work together to determine the most appropriate ways to foster constructive relationships, particularly through duly-elected resident councils.

      § 964.12   HUD policy on the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP).

#### § § 964.12

      HUD promotes TOP programs to support activities that enable residents to improve the quality of life and resident satisfaction, and obtain other social and economic benefits for residents and their families. Tenant opportunity programs are proven to be effective in facilitating economic uplift, as well as in improving the overall conditions of the public housing communities.

      § 964.14   HUD policy on partnerships.

#### § § 964.14

      HUD promotes partnerships between residents and HAs which are an essential component to building, strengthening and improving public housing. Strong partnerships are critical for creating positive changes in lifestyles thus improving the quality of life for public housing residents, and the surrounding community.

      § 964.15   HUD policy on resident management.

#### § § 964.15

      It is HUD's policy to encourage resident management. HUD encourages HAs, resident councils and resident management corporations to explore the various functions involved in management to identify appropriate opportunities for contracting with a resident management corporation. Potential benefits of resident-managed entities include improved quality of life, experiencing the dignity of meaningful work, enabling residents to choose where they want to live, and meaningful participation in the management of the housing development.

      § 964.16   HUD role in activities under this part.

#### § § 964.16

      (a)  Subject to the requirements of this part and other requirements imposed on HAs by the ACC, statute or regulation, the form and extent of resident participation including resident management are local decisions to be made jointly by resident councils/resident management corporations and their HAs. HUD will promote tenant participation and tenant opportunities programs, and will provide additional guidance, as necessary and appropriate. In addition, HUD will endeavor to provide technical assistance in connection with these initiatives.

      (b)  HUD shall ensure that the requirements under this part are operating efficiently and effectively.

      § 964.18   HA role in activities under subparts B & C.

#### § § 964.18

      (a)  (1) A HA shall officially recognize a duly elected resident council as the sole representative of the residents it purports to represent, and support its tenant participation activities.

      (2) When requested by residents, a HA shall provide appropriate guidance to residents to assist them in establishing and maintaining a resident council.

      (3) A HA may consult with residents, or resident councils (if they exist), to determine the extent to which residents desire to participate in activities involving their community, including the management of specific functions of a public housing development that may be mutually agreeable to the HA and the resident council/resident management corporation.

      (4) A HA shall provide the residents or any resident council with current information concerning the HA's policies on tenant participation in management.

      (5) If requested, a HA should provide a duly recognized resident council office space and meeting facilities, free of charge, preferably within the development it represents. If there is no community or rental space available, a request to approve a vacant unit for this non-dwelling use will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

      (6) If requested, a HA shall negotiate with the duly elected resident council on all uses of community space for meetings, recreation and social services and other resident participation activities pursuant to HUD guidelines. Such agreements shall be put into a written document to be signed by the HA and the resident council. If a HA fails to negotiate with a resident council in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses to permit such usage of community space, the resident council may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing copies of relevant materials evidencing the resident council's efforts to negotiate a written agreement. HUD shall require the HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the request or for refusing to negotiate. HUD shall require the parties (with or without direct HUD participation) to undertake or to resume negotiations on an agreement. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days).

      (7) In no event shall HUD or a HA recognize a competing resident council once a duly elected resident council has been established. Any funding of resident activities and resident input into decisions concerning public housing operations shall be made only through the officially recognized resident council.

      (8) The HA shall ensure open communication and frequent meetings between HA management and resident councils and shall encourage the formation of joint HA management-resident committees to work on issues and planning.

      (9) The resident council shall hold frequent meetings with the residents to ensure that residents have input, and are aware and actively involved in HA management-resident council decisions and activities.

      (10) The HA and resident council shall put in writing in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding the elements of their partnership agreement and it shall be updated at least once every three (3) years.

      (11) The HA, in collaboration with the resident councils, shall assume the lead role for assuring maximum opportunities for skills training for public housing residents. To the extent possible, the training resources should be local to ensure maximum benefit and on-going access.

      (b)  (1) HAs with fewer than 250 units of public housing have the option of participating in programs under this part.

      (2) HAs shall not deny residents the opportunity to organize. If the residents decide to organize and form a resident council, the HA shall comply with the following:

      (i) A HA shall officially recognize a duly elected resident council as the sole representative of the residents it purports to represent, and support its tenant participation activities.

      (ii) When requested by residents, a HA shall provide appropriate guidance to residents to assist them in establishing and maintaining a resident council.

      (iii) A HA shall provide the residents or any resident council with current information concerning the HA's policies on tenant participation in management.

      (iv) In no event shall HUD or a HA officially recognize a competing resident council once a duly elected resident council has been established. If a duly elected resident council has been formed, any input into changes concerning public housing operations shall be made only through the officially recognized resident council.

Such appeal shall be submitted to a jointly selected third-party arbitrator at the local level. If costs are incurred by using a third-party arbitrator, then such costs should be paid from the HAs resident services funds pursuant to § 964.150.

      § 964.135   Resident involvement in HA management operations.

#### § § 964.135

      Residents shall be involved and participate in the overall policy development and direction of Public Housing operations.

      (a) Resident management corporations (RMCs) may contract with HAs to perform one or more management functions provided the resident entity has received sufficient training and/or has staff with the necessary expertise to perform the management functions and provided the RMC meets bonding and licensing requirements.

      (b) Residents shall be actively involved in a HA's decision-making process and give advice on matters such as modernization, security, maintenance, resident screening and selection, and recreation.

      (c) While a HA has responsibility for management operations, it shall ensure strong resident participation in all issues and facets of its operations through the duly elected resident councils at public housing developments, and with jurisdiction-wide resident councils.

      (d) A HA shall work in partnership with the duly elected resident councils.

      (e) HAs, upon request from the duly elected resident council, shall ensure that the duly elected resident council officers as defined in subpart B of this part, and other residents in the development are fully trained and involved in developing and implementing Federal programs including but not limited to Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), Comprehensive Grant Program, Urban Revitalization Demonstration, Drug Elimination, and FIC.

      § 964.150   Funding tenant participation.

#### § § 964.150

      (a)  (1) The HA shall provide funds it receives for this purpose to the duly elected resident council at each development and/or those jurisdiction-wide councils eligible to receive the resident portion of the tenant services account to use for resident participation activities. This shall be an addition to the Performance Funding System (PFS), as provided by 24 CFR part 990, to permit HAs to fund $25 per unit per year for units represented by duly elected resident councils for resident services, subject to the availability of appropriations. Of this amount, $15 per unit per year would be provided to fund tenant participation activities under subpart B of this part for duly elected resident councils and/or jurisdiction-wide councils and $10 per unit per year would be used by the HA to pay for costs incurred in carrying out tenant participation activities under subpart B of this part, including the expenses for conducting elections, recalls or arbitration required under § 964.130 in subpart B. This will guarantee the resources necessary to create a bona fide partnership among the duly elected resident councils, the HA and HUD. Where both local and jurisdiction-wide councils exist, the distribution will be agreed upon by the HA and the respective councils.

      (2) If funds are available through appropriations, the HA must provide tenant services funding to the duly elected resident councils regardless of the HA's financial status. The resident council funds shall not be impacted or restricted by the HA financial status and all said funds must be used for the purpose set forth in subparts B and C of this part.

      (3) The HA and the duly elected resident council at each development and/or those jurisdiction-wide councils shall collaborate on how the funds will be distributed for tenant participation activities. If disputes regarding funding decisions arise between the parties, the matter shall be referred to the Field Office for intervention. HUD Field Office shall require the parties to undertake further negotiations to resolve the dispute. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date of the Field Office intervention, the Field Office shall refer the matter to HUD Headquarters for final resolution.

      (b)  (1) HUD encourages HAs to provide stipends to resident council officers who serve as volunteers in their public housing developments. The amount of the stipend, up to $200 per month/per officer, shall be decided locally by the resident council and the HA. Subject to appropriations, the stipends will be funded from the resident council's portion of the operating subsidy funding for resident council expenses ($15.00 per unit per year).

      (2) Pursuant to § 913.106, stipends are not to be construed as salaries and should not be included as income for calculation of rents, and are not subject to conflict of interest requirements.

      (3) Funding provided by a HA to a duly elected resident council may be made only under a written agreement between the HA and a resident council, which includes a resident council budget and assurance that all resident council expenditures will not contravene provisions of law and will promote serviceability, efficiency, economy and stability in the operation of the local development. The agreement must require the local resident council to account to the HA for the use of the funds and permit the HA to inspect and audit the resident council's financial records related to the agreement.

      § 964.225   Resident management requirements.

#### § § 964.225

      The following requirements apply when a HA and its residents are interested in providing for resident performance of several management functions in one or more projects.

      (a)  Resident councils interested in contracting with a HA must establish a resident management corporation that meets the requirements for such a corporation, as specified in subpart B. The RMC and its employees must demonstrate their ability and skill to perform in the particular areas of management pursuant to the management contract.

      (b)  HAs shall give full and serious consideration to resident management corporations seeking to enter into a management contract with the HA. A HA shall enter into good-faith negotiations with a corporation seeking to contract to provide management services.

      (c)  If a HA refuses to negotiate with a resident management corporation in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses to enter into a contract, the corporation may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing copies of relevant materials evidencing the corporation's efforts to negotiate a contract.

Thereafter, HUD shall require the parties (with or without direct HUD participation) to undertake or to resume negotiations on a contract providing for resident management, and shall take such other actions as are necessary to resolve the conflicts between the parties. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days).

      (d)  A management contract between the HA and a resident management corporation is required for property management. The HA and the resident management corporation may agree to the performance by the corporation of any or all management functions for which the HA is responsible to HUD under the ACC and any other functions not inconsistent with the ACC and applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements.

      (e)  The management contract shall be treated as a contracting out of services, and must be subject to any provision of a collective bargaining agreement regarding the contracting out of services to which the HA is subject. Provisions on competitive bidding and requirements of prior written HUD approval of contracts contained in the ACC do not apply to the decision of a HA to contract with a RMC.

      (f)  If a resident management corporation is approved by the tenant organization representing one or more buildings or an area of row houses that are part of a public housing project for purposes of part 941 of this chapter, the resident management program may not, as determined by the HA, interfere with the rights of other residents of such project or harm the efficient operation of such project.

      (g)  (1) The HA may enter into a contract with the RMC to provide comprehensive improvement assistance under part 968 of this chapter to modernize a project managed by the RMC.

      (2) The HA shall not retain, for any administrative or other reason, any portion of the comprehensive improvement assistance provided, unless the PHA and the RMC provide otherwise by contract.

      (3) In assessing the modernization needs of its projects under 24 CFR part 968, or other grant mechanisms established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the HAs must consult with the tenant management corporation regarding any project managed by the corporation, in order to determine the modernization needs and preferences of resident-managed projects. Evidence of this required consultation must be included with a HA's initial submission to HUD.

      (h) —(1)  The ACC shall provide for the direct provision of operating and capital assistance by HUD to an RMC if:

      (i) The RMC petitions HUD for the release of funds;

      (ii) The contract provides for the RMC to assume the primary management responsibilities of the PHA;

      (iii) The RMC has been designated as at least a “standard performer” under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) (see 24 CFR part 902); and

      (iv) The RMC is not in violation of any financial, accounting, procurement, civil rights, fair housing or other program requirements that HUD determines call into question the capability of the RMC to effectively discharge its responsibilities under the contract.

      (2)  Any direct capital or operating assistance provided to the RMC must be used for purposes of performing eligible activities with respect to public housing as may be provided under the contract.

      (3)  If HUD provides direct funding to a RMC under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the PHA is not responsible for the actions of the RMC.

      (i)  A HA may not contract for assumption by the resident management corporation of the HA's underlying responsibilities to HUD under the ACC.

      (j) —(1)  Before assuming any management responsibility under its contract, the RMC must provide fidelity bonding and insurance, or equivalent protection that is adequate (as determined by HUD and the PHA) to protect HUD and the PHA against loss, theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the RMC or its employees.

      (2)  An RMC must be in compliance with any local licensing, or other local requirement, governing the qualifications or operations of a property manager.

      (k)  Upon the joint request of a resident management corporation and the HA, HUD may waive any requirement that HUD has established and that is not required by law, if HUD determines, after consultation with the resident management corporation and the HA, that the requirement unnecessarily increases the costs to the project or restricts the income of the project; and that the waiver would be consistent with the management contract and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Any waiver granted to a resident management corporation under this section will apply as well to the HA to the extent the waiver affects the HA's remaining responsibilities relating to the resident management corporation's project.

      (l)  The HA must review periodically (but not less than annually) the management corporation's performance to ensure that it complies with all applicable requirements and meets agreed-upon standards of performance. (The method of review and criteria used to judge performance should be specified in the management contract.)

      (3) Alternatively, the board member may be allowed to complete his/her current term as a member of the governing board. However, the board member may not be re-appointed (or re-elected) to the governing board for purposes of serving as the statutorily required resident board member.

      (c)  Any generally applicable qualifications for board membership also apply to residents, unless the application of the requirements would result in the governing board not containing at least one eligible resident as a member. Further, PHAs and localities may not establish eligibility requirements for board membership that are solely applicable to residents.

      § 964.420   Resident board member may be elected.

#### § § 964.420

      (b)  A public housing agency that has no public housing units, but administers Section 8 tenant-based assistance, is eligible for the exception described in paragraph (a) of this section, regardless of the number of Section 8 vouchers it administers.

      (c)  A public housing agency that is otherwise eligible for the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but does not meet the three conditions described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, must comply with the requirements of this subpart.

      (ii) Do not involve housing assistance (as may occur where the city or county governing body also serves as the PHA board).

      (3)  A public housing agency may choose to expand the scope of resident member involvement to matters not required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (b)  A governing board may not prohibit any person from serving on the governing board because that person is a resident of a public housing project or is assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).

      (c)  A governing board may not exclude any resident board member from participating in any matter before the governing board on the grounds that the resident board member's lease with the public housing agency, or the resident board member's status as a public housing resident or recipient of Section 8 tenant-based assistance, either results or may result in a conflict of interest, unless the matter is clearly applicable to the resident board member only in a personal capacity and applies uniquely to that member and not generally to residents or to a subcategory of residents.

    Subpart B—Required Insurance Coverage

**Source:** Source: 58 FR 51957, Oct. 5, 1993, unless otherwise noted.

      § 965.201   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 965.201

      (a)  The purpose of this subpart is to implement policies concerning insurance coverage required under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and a Public Housing Agency (PHA).

      (b)  The provisions of this subpart apply to all housing owned by PHAs, including Turnkey III housing. However, these provisions do not apply to Section 23 and Section 10(c) PHA-leased projects or to Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program projects.

      § 965.205   Qualified PHA-owned insurance entity.

#### § § 965.205

      (a)  The Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between PHAs and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires that PHAs maintain specified insurance coverage for property and casualty losses that would jeopardize the financial stability of the PHAs. The insurance coverage is required to be obtained under procedures that provide “for open and competitive bidding.” The HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provided that a PHA could purchase insurance coverage without regard to competitive selection procedures when it purchases it from a nonprofit insurance entity owned and controlled by PHAs approved by HUD in accordance with standards established by regulation. This section specifies the standards.

      (b)  While 2 CFR 200.319 requires that grantees solicit full and open competition for their procurements, the HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provides an exception to this requirement. PHAs are authorized to obtain any line of insurance from a nonprofit insurance entity that is owned and controlled by PHAs and approved by HUD in accordance with this section, without regard to competitive selection procedures. Procurement of insurance from other entities is subject to competitive selection procedures.

      (c)  Under the following conditions, HUD will approve a nonprofit self-funded insurance entity created by PHAs that limits participation to PHAs (and to nonprofit entities associated with PHAs that engage in activities or perform functions only for housing authorities or housing authority residents):

      (1)  (i) The insurance company is licensed or authorized to do business in the State by the State Insurance Commissioner and has submitted documentation of this approval to HUD; and

      (ii) The insurance company has not been suspended from providing insurance coverage in the State or been suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal government. The insurance company is obligated to send to HUD a copy of any action taken by the authorizing official to withdraw the license or authorization.

      (2)  (i) The entity has competent underwriting staff (hired directly or engaged by contract with a third party), as evidenced by professionals with an average of at least five years of experience in large risk (exceeding $100,000 in annual premiums) commercial underwriting or at least five years of experience in the underwriting of risks for public entity risk pools. This standard may be satisfied by submission of evidence of competent underwriting staff, including copies of resumes of underwriting staff for the entity;

      (ii) The entity has efficient and qualified management (hired directly or engaged by contract with a third party), as evidenced by the report submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section and by having at least one senior staff person who has a minimum of five years of experience:

      (A) At the management level of Vice President of a property/casualty insurance entity;

      (B) As a senior branch manager of a branch office with annual property/casualty premiums exceeding $5 million; or

      (C) As a senior manager of a public entity risk pool. Documentation for this standard must include copies of resumes of key management personnel responsible for oversight and for the day-to-day operation of the entity;

      (iii) The entity maintains internal controls and cost containment measures, as evidenced by an annual budget;

      (iv) The entity maintains sound investments consistent with the State insurance commissioner's requirements for licensed insurance companies, or other State statutory requirements controlling investments of public entities, in the State in which the entity is organized, investing only in assets that qualify as “admitted assets”;

      (v) The entity maintains adequate surplus and reserves for undischarged liabilities of all types, as evidenced by a current audited financial statement and an actuarial review conducted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and

      (vi) Upon application for initial approval, the entity has proper organizational documentation, as evidenced by copies of the articles of incorporation, by-laws, business plans, copies of contracts with third party administrators, and an opinion from legal counsel that establishment of the entity conforms with all legal requirements under Federal and State law. Any material changes made to these documents after initial approval must be submitted for review and approval before becoming effective.

      (d)  Audits and actuarial reviews are required to be prepared and submitted annually to the HUD Office of Public and Indian Housing, for review and appropriate action, by nonprofit insurance entities that are not insurance companies approved under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In addition, an evaluation of other management factors is required to be performed by an insurance professional every three years. For fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 1993, the initial audit, actuarial review, and insurance management review required for a nonprofit insurance entity must be submitted to HUD within 90 days after the entity's fiscal year.

      (1) The annual financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (including any supplementary data required under GASB 10) is to be audited by an independent auditor (see 2 CFR part 200, subpart F), in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The independent auditor shall express an opinion on whether the entity's financial statement is presented fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A copy of this audit must be submitted to HUD.

      (2) The actuarial review must be done consistent with requirements established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and must be conducted by an independent property/casualty actuary who is an Associate or Fellow of a recognized professional actuarial organization, such as the Casualty Actuary Society. The report issued, a copy of which must be submitted to HUD, must include an opinion on any over or under reserving and the adequacy of the reserves maintained for the open claims and for incurred but unreported claims.

      (3) A review must be conducted, a copy of which must be submitted to HUD, by an independent insurance consulting firm that has at least one person on staff who has received the professional designation of chartered property/casualty underwriter (CPCU), associate in risk management (ARM), or associate in claims (AIC), of the following:

      (i) Efficiency of any Third Party Administrator;

      (ii) Timeliness of the claim payments and reserving practices; and

      (iii) The adequacy of reinsurance coverage.

      (e)  HUD may revoke its approval of a nonprofit insurance entity under this section when it no longer meets the requirements of this section. The nonprofit insurance entity will be notified in writing of: the proposed revocation of its approval, the reasons for the action, and the manner and time in which to request a hearing to challenge the determination. The procedure to be followed is specified in 24 CFR part 26, subpart A.

      § 965.215   Lead-based paint liability insurance coverage.

#### § § 965.215

      (a)  The purpose of this section is to specify what HUD deems reasonable insurance coverage with respect to the hazards associated with lead-based paint activities that the PHA undertakes, in accordance with the PHA's ACC with HUD. The insurance coverage does not relieve the PHA of its responsibility for assuring that lead-based paint activities are conducted in a responsible manner.

      (b)  When the PHA undertakes lead-based paint activities, it must assure that it has reasonable insurance coverage for itself for potential personal injury liability associated with those activities. If the work is being done by PHA employees, the PHA must obtain a liability insurance policy directly to protect the PHA. If the work is being done by a contractor, the PHA must obtain, from the insurer of the contractor performing this type of work in accordance with a contract, a certificate of insurance providing evidence of such insurance and naming the PHA as an additional insured; or obtain such insurance directly. Insurance must remain in effect during the entire period of lead-based paint activity and must comply with the following requirements:

      (1)  If purchased by the PHA, the policy shall name the PHA as insured. If purchased by an independent contractor, the policy shall name the contractor as insured and the PHA as an additional insured, in connection with performing work under the PHA's contract pertaining to lead-based paint activities. If the PHA has executed a contract with a Resident Management Corporation (RMC) to manage a building/project on behalf of the PHA, the RMC shall be an additional insured under the policy in connection with the PHA's contract related to lead-based paint activities. (The duties of the RMC are similar to those of a real estate management firm.)

      (2)  The minimum limit of liability shall be $500,000 per occurrence written, with a combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage.

      (3)  A deductible, if any, may not exceed $5,000 per occurrence.

      (4)  Payments for such supplementary costs as the costs of defending against a claim must be in addition to, and not as a reduction of, the limit of liability. However, it will be permissible for the policy to have a limit on the amount payable for defense costs. If a limit is applicable, it must not be less than $250,000 per claim prior to such costs being deducted from the limit of liability.

      (5)  The form used must be an “occurrence” form, or a “claims made” form that contains an extended reporting period of at least five years. (Under an occurrence form, coverage applies to any loss regardless of when the claim is made.)

      (6)  If the policy contains an aggregate limit, the minimum acceptable limit is $1,000,000.

      (7)  In the event of cancellation, at least 30 days' advance notice is to be given to the insured and any additional insured.

      (c)  Insurance already purchased by the PHA or contractor and enforced on the day this section is effective which provides coverage for lead-based paint activities shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this section until the expiration of the policy. This section is not applicable to architects, engineers or consultants who do not physically perform lead-based paint activities.

      (d)  A PHA may also purchase special liability insurance against the existence of lead-based paint hazards, although it is not a required coverage. A PHA may purchase this coverage if, in the opinion of the PHA, the policy meets the PHA's requirements, the premium is reasonable and the policy is obtained in accordance with applicable procurement standards. (See 2 CFR part 200 and § 965.205 of this title.) If this coverage is purchased, the premium must be paid from funds available under the Performance Funding System or from reserves.

    Subpart C—Energy Audits and Energy Conservation Measures

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 7969, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 965.301   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 965.301

      (a)  The purpose of this subpart C is to implement HUD policies in support of national energy conservation goals by requiring PHAs to conduct energy audits and undertake certain cost-effective energy conservation measures.

      (b)  The provisions of this subpart apply to all PHAs with PHA-owned housing, but they do not apply to Indian Housing Authorities. (For similar provisions applicable to Indian housing, see part 950 of this chapter.) No PHA-leased project or Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program project, including a PHA-owned Section 8 project, is covered by this subpart.

      § 965.302   Requirements for energy audits.

#### § § 965.302

      All PHAs shall complete an energy audit for each PHA-owned project under management, not less than once every five years. Standards for energy audits shall be equivalent to State standards for energy audits. Energy audits shall analyze all of the energy conservation measures, and the payback period for these measures, that are pertinent to the type of buildings and equipment operated by the PHA.

      § 965.303   [Reserved]

#### § § 965.303

      § 965.304   Order of funding.

#### § § 965.304

      Within the funds available to a PHA, energy conservation measures should be accomplished with the shortest pay-back periods funded first. A PHA may make adjustments to this funding order because of insufficient funds to accomplish high-cost energy conservation measures (ECM) or where an ECM with a longer pay-back period can be more efficiently installed in conjunction with other planned modernization. A PHA may not install individual utility meters that measure the energy or fuel used for space heating in dwelling units that need substantial weatherization, when installation of meters would result in economic hardship for residents. In these cases, the ECMs related to weatherization shall be accomplished before the installation of individual utility meters.

      § 965.305   Funding.

#### § § 965.305

      (a) The cost of accomplishing cost-effective energy conservation measures, including the cost of performing energy audits, shall be funded from operating funds of the PHA to the extent feasible. When sufficient operating funds are not available for this purpose, such costs are eligible for inclusion in a modernization program, for funding from any available development funds in the case of projects still in development, or for other available funds that HUD may designate to be used for energy conservation.

      (b) If a PHA finances energy conservation measures from sources other than modernization or operating reserves, such as a loan from a utility entity or a guaranteed savings agreement with a private energy service company, HUD may agree to provide adjustments in its calculation of the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility under the PFS for the project and utility involved based on a determination that payments can be funded from the reasonably anticipated energy cost savings (See § 990.107(g) of this chapter).

      § 965.306   Energy conservation equipment and practices.

#### § § 965.306

      In purchasing original or, when needed, replacement equipment, PHAs shall acquire only equipment that meets or exceeds the minimum efficiency requirements established by the U.S. Department of Energy. In the operation of their facilities, PHAs shall follow operating practices directed to maximum energy conservation.

      § 965.307   Compliance schedule.

#### § § 965.307

      All energy conservation measures determined by energy audits to be cost effective shall be accomplished as funds are available.

      § 965.308   Energy performance contracts.

#### § § 965.308

      (a)  Energy performance contracting shall be conducted using one of the following methods of procurement:

      (1) Competitive proposals (see 2 CFR 200.320(d)). In identifying the evaluation factors and their relative importance, as required by § 2 CFR 200.320(d) of this title, the solicitation shall state that technical factors are significantly more important than price (of the energy audit); or

      (2) If the services are available only from a single source, noncompetitive proposals (see 2 CFR 200.320(f)).

      (b)  Solicitations for energy performance contracting shall be submitted to the HUD Field Office for review and approval prior to issuance. Energy performance contracts shall be submitted to the HUD Field Office for review and approval before award.

    Subpart D—Individual Metering of Utilities for Existing PHA-Owned Projects

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 7970, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 965.401   Individually metered utilities.

#### § § 965.401

      (a) All utility service shall be individually metered to residents, either through provision of retail service to the residents by the utility supplier or through the use of checkmeters, unless:

      (1) Individual metering is impractical, such as in the case of a central heating system in an apartment building;

      (2) Change from a mastermetering system to individual meters would not be financially justified based upon a benefit/cost analysis; or

      (3) Checkmetering is not permissible under State or local law, or under the policies of the particular utility supplier or public service commission.

      (b) If checkmetering is not permissible, retail service shall be considered. Where checkmetering is permissible, the type of individual metering offering the most savings to the PHA shall be selected.

      § 965.402   Benefit/cost analysis.

#### § § 965.402

      (a) A benefit/cost analysis shall be made to determine whether a change from a mastermetering system to individual meters will be cost effective, except as otherwise provided in § 965.405.

      (b) Proposed installation of checkmeters shall be justified on the basis that the cost of debt service (interest and amortization) of the estimated installation costs plus the operating costs of the checkmeters will be more than offset by reduction in future utilities expenditures to the PHA under the mastermeter system.

      (c) Proposed conversion to retail service shall be justified on the basis of net savings to the PHA. This determination involves making a comparison between the reduction in utility expense obtained through eliminating the expense to the PHA for PHA-supplied utilities and the resultant allowance for resident-supplied utilities, based on the cost of utility service to the residents after conversion.

      § 965.403   Funding.

#### § § 965.403

      The cost to change mastermeter systems to individual metering of resident consumption, including the costs of benefit/cost analysis and complete installation of checkmeters, shall be funded from operating funds of the PHA to the extent feasible. When sufficient operating funds are not available for this purpose, such costs are eligible for inclusion in a modernization project or for funding from any available development funds.

      § 965.404   Order of conversion.

#### § § 965.404

      Conversions to individually metered utility service shall be accomplished in the following order when a PHA has projects of two or more of the designated categories, unless the PHA has a justifiable reason to do otherwise, which shall be documented in its files.

      (a) In projects for which retail service is provided by the utility supplier and the PHA is paying all the individual utility bills, no benefit/cost analysis is necessary, and residents shall be billed directly after the PHA adopts revised payment schedules providing appropriate allowances for resident-supplied utilities.

      (b) In projects for which checkmeters have been installed but are not being utilized as the basis for determining utility charges to the residents, no benefit/cost analysis is necessary. The checkmeters shall be used as the basis for utility charges, and residents shall be surcharged for excess utility use.

      (c) Projects for which meter loops have been installed for utilization of checkmeters shall be analyzed both for the installation of checkmeters and for conversion to retail service.

      (d) Low- or medium-rise family units with a mastermeter system should be analyzed for both checkmetering and conversion to retail service, because of their large potential for energy savings.

      (e) Low- or medium-rise housing for the elderly should next be analyzed for both checkmetering and conversion to retail service, since the potential for energy saving is less than for family units.

      (f) Electric service under mastermeters for high-rise buildings, including projects for the elderly, should be analyzed for both use of retail service and of checkmeters.

      § 965.405   Actions affecting residents.

#### § § 965.405

      (a) Before making any conversion to retail service, the PHA shall adopt revised payment schedules, providing appropriate allowances for the resident-supplied utilities resulting from the conversion.

      (b) Before implementing any modifications to utility services arrangements with the residents or charges with respect thereto, the PHA shall make the requisite changes in resident dwelling leases in accordance with 24 CFR part 966.

      (c) PHAs must work closely with resident organizations, to the extent practicable, in making plans for conversion of utility service to individual metering, explaining the national policy objectives of energy conservation, the changes in charges and rent structure that will result, and the goals of achieving an equitable structure that will be advantageous to residents who conserve energy.

      (d) A transition period of at least six months shall be provided in the case of initiation of checkmeters, during which residents will be advised of the charges but during which no surcharge will be made based on the readings. This trial period will afford residents ample notice of the effects the checkmetering system will have on their individual utility charges and also afford a test period for the adequacy of the utility allowances established.

      (e) During and after the transition period, PHAs shall advise and assist residents with high utility consumption on methods for reducing their usage. This advice and assistance may include counseling, installation of new energy conserving equipment or appliances, and corrective maintenance.

      § 965.406   Benefit/cost analysis for similar projects.

#### § § 965.406

      PHAs with more than one project of similar design and utilities service may prepare a benefit/cost analysis for a representative project. A finding that a change in metering is not cost effective for the representative project is sufficient reason for the PHA not to perform a benefit/cost analysis on the remaining similar projects.

      § 965.407   Reevaluations of mastermeter systems.

#### § § 965.407

      Because of changes in the cost of utility services and the periodic changes in utility regulations, PHAs with mastermeter systems are required to reevaluate mastermeter systems without checkmeters by making benefit/cost analyses at least every 5 years. These analyses may be omitted under the conditions specified in § 965.406.

    Subpart E—Resident Allowances for Utilities

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 7971, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 965.501   Applicability.

#### § § 965.501

      (a) This subpart E applies to public housing, including the Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunities program. This subpart E also applies to units assisted under sections 10(c) and 23 of the U. S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 ) as in effect before amendment by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 1706e) and to which 24 CFR part 900 is not applicable. This subpart E does not apply to Indian housing projects (see 24 CFR part 950).

      (b) In rental units for which utilities are furnished by the PHA but there are no checkmeters to measure the actual utilities consumption of the individual units, residents shall be subject to charges for consumption by resident-owned major appliances, or for optional functions of PHA-furnished equipment, in accordance with § 965.502(e) and 965.506(b), but no utility allowance will be established.

      § 965.502   Establishment of utility allowances by PHAs.

#### § § 965.502

      (a) PHAs shall establish allowances for PHA-furnished utilities for all checkmetered utilities and allowances for resident-purchased utilities for all utilities purchased directly by residents from the utilities suppliers.

      (b) The PHA shall maintain a record that documents the basis on which allowances and scheduled surcharges, and revisions thereof, are established and revised. Such record shall be available for inspection by residents.

      (c) The PHA shall give notice to all residents of proposed allowances, scheduled surcharges, and revisions thereof. Such notice shall be given, in the manner provided in the lease or homebuyer agreement, not less than 60 days before the proposed effective date of the allowances or scheduled surcharges or revisions; shall describe with reasonable particularity the basis for determination of the allowances, scheduled surcharges, or revisions, including a statement of the specific items of equipment and function whose utility consumption requirements were included in determining the amounts of the allowances or scheduled surcharges; shall notify residents of the place where the PHA's record maintained in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section is available for inspection; and shall provide all residents an opportunity to submit written comments during a period expiring not less than 30 days before the proposed effective date of the allowances or scheduled surcharges or revisions. Such written comments shall be retained by the PHA and shall be available for inspection by residents.

      (d) Schedules of allowances and scheduled surcharges shall not be subject to approval by HUD before becoming effective, but will be reviewed in the course of audits or reviews of PHA operations.

      (e) The PHA's determinations of allowances, scheduled surcharges, and revisions thereof shall be final and valid unless found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.

      § 965.503   Categories for establishment of allowances.

#### § § 965.503

      Separate allowances shall be established for each utility and for each category of dwelling units determined by the PHA to be reasonably comparable as to factors affecting utility usage.

      § 965.504   Period for which allowances are established.

#### § § 965.504

      (a)  Allowances will normally be established on a quarterly basis; however, residents may be surcharged on a monthly basis. The allowances established may provide for seasonal variations.

      (b)  Monthly allowances shall be established. The allowances established may provide for seasonal variations.

      § 965.505   Standards for allowances for utilities.

#### § § 965.505

      (a) The objective of a PHA in designing methods of establishing utility allowances for each dwelling unit category and unit size shall be to approximate a reasonable consumption of utilities by an energy-conservative household of modest circumstances consistent with the requirements of a safe, sanitary, and healthful living environment.

      (b) Allowances for both PHA-furnished and resident-purchased utilities shall be designed to include such reasonable consumption for major equipment or for utility functions furnished by the PHA for all residents (e.g., heating furnace, hot water heater), for essential equipment whether or not furnished by the PHA (e.g., range and refrigerator), and for minor items of equipment (such as toasters and radios) furnished by residents.

      (c) The complexity and elaborateness of the methods chosen by the PHA, in its discretion, to achieve the foregoing objective will depend upon the nature of the housing stock, data available to the PHA and the extent of the administrative resources reasonably available to the PHA to be devoted to the collection of such data, the formulation of methods of calculation, and actual calculation and monitoring of the allowances.

      (d) In establishing allowances, the PHA shall take into account relevant factors affecting consumption requirements, including:

      (1) The equipment and functions intended to be covered by the allowance for which the utility will be used. For instance, natural gas may be used for cooking, heating domestic water, or space heating, or any combination of the three;

      (2) The climatic location of the housing projects;

      (3) The size of the dwelling units and the number of occupants per dwelling unit;

      (4) Type of construction and design of the housing project;

      (5) The energy efficiency of PHA-supplied appliances and equipment;

      (6) The utility consumption requirements of appliances and equipment whose reasonable consumption is intended to be covered by the total resident payment;

      (7) The physical condition, including insulation and weatherization, of the housing project;

      (8) Temperature levels intended to be maintained in the unit during the day and at night, and in cold and warm weather; and

      (9) Temperature of domestic hot water.

      (e) If a PHA installs air conditioning, it shall provide, to the maximum extent economically feasible, systems that give residents the option of choosing to use air conditioning in their units. The design of systems that offer each resident the option to choose air conditioning shall include retail meters or checkmeters, and residents shall pay for the energy used in its operation. For systems that offer residents the option to choose air conditioning, the PHA shall not include air conditioning in the utility allowances. For systems that offer residents the option to choose air conditioning but cannot be checkmetered, residents are to be surcharged in accordance with § 965.506. If an air conditioning system does not provide for resident option, residents are not to be charged, and these systems should be avoided whenever possible.

      § 965.506   Surcharges for excess consumption of PHA-furnished utilities.

#### § § 965.506

      (a) For dwelling units subject to allowances for PHA-furnished utilities where checkmeters have been installed, the PHA shall establish surcharges for utility consumption in excess of the allowances. Surcharges may be computed on a straight per unit of purchase basis (e.g., cents per kilowatt hour of electricity) or for stated blocks of excess consumption, and shall be based on the PHA's average utility rate. The basis for calculating such surcharges shall be described in the PHA's schedule of allowances. Changes in the dollar amounts of surcharges based directly on changes in the PHA's average utility rate shall not be subject to the advance notice requirements of this section.

      (b) For dwelling units served by PHA-furnished utilities where checkmeters have not been installed, the PHA shall establish schedules of surcharges indicating additional dollar amounts residents will be required to pay by reason of estimated utility consumption attributable to resident-owned major appliances or to optional functions of PHA-furnished equipment. Such surcharge schedules shall state the resident-owned equipment (or functions of PHA-furnished equipment) for which surcharges shall be made and the amounts of such charges, which shall be based on the cost to the PHA of the utility consumption estimated to be attributable to reasonable usage of such equipment.

      § 965.507   Review and revision of allowances.

#### § § 965.507

      (a)  The PHA shall review at least annually the basis on which utility allowances have been established and, if reasonably required in order to continue adherence to the standards stated in § 965.505, shall establish revised allowances. The review shall include all changes in circumstances (including completion of modernization and/or other energy conservation measures implemented by the PHA) indicating probability of a significant change in reasonable consumption requirements and changes in utility rates.

      (b)  The PHA may revise its allowances for resident-purchased utilities between annual reviews if there is a rate change (including fuel adjustments) and shall be required to do so if such change, by itself or together with prior rate changes not adjusted for, results in a change of 10 percent or more from the rates on which such allowances were based. Adjustments to resident payments as a result of such changes shall be retroactive to the first day of the month following the month in which the last rate change taken into account in such revision became effective. Such rate changes shall not be subject to the 60 day notice requirement of § 965.502(c).

      § 965.508   Individual relief.

#### § § 965.508

      Requests for relief from surcharges for excess consumption of PHA-purchased utilities, or from payment of utility supplier billings in excess of the allowances for resident-purchased utilities, may be granted by the PHA on reasonable grounds, such as special needs of elderly, ill or disabled residents, or special factors affecting utility usage not within the control of the resident, as the PHA shall deem appropriate. The PHA's criteria for granting such relief, and procedures for requesting such relief, shall be adopted at the time the PHA adopts the methods and procedures for determining utility allowances. Notice of the availability of such procedures (including identification of the PHA representative with whom initial contact may be made by residents), and the PHA's criteria for granting such relief, shall be included in each notice to residents given in accordance with § 965.502(c) and in the information given to new residents upon admission.

    Subpart F—Physical Condition Standards and Physical Inspection Requirements

      § 965.601   Physical condition standards; physical inspection requirements.

#### § § 965.601

      Housing owned or leased by a PHA, and public housing owned by another entity approved by HUD, must be maintained in accordance with the physical condition standards in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G. For each PHA, HUD will perform an independent physical inspection of a statistically valid sample of such housing based upon the physical condition standards in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.

Public housing is defined as low-income housing, and all necessary appurtenances ( community facilities, public housing offices, day care centers, and laundry rooms) thereto, assisted under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act), other than assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act.

      § 965.653   Smoke-free public housing.

#### § § 965.653

      (a)  PHAs must design and implement a policy prohibiting the use of prohibited tobacco products in all public housing living units and interior areas (including but not limited to hallways, rental and administrative offices, community centers, day care centers, laundry centers, and similar structures), as well as in outdoor areas within 25 feet from public housing and administrative office buildings (collectively, “restricted areas”) in which public housing is located.

      (b)  PHAs may limit smoking to designated smoking areas on the grounds of the public housing or administrative office buildings in order to accommodate residents who smoke. These areas must be outside of any restricted areas, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, and may include partially enclosed structures. Alternatively, PHAs may choose to create additional smoke-free areas outside the restricted areas or to make their entire grounds smoke-free.

      (c)  A PHA's smoke-free policy must, at a minimum, ban the use of all prohibited tobacco products. Prohibited tobacco products are defined as:

      (1) Items that involve the ignition and burning of tobacco leaves, such as (but not limited to) cigarettes, cigars, and pipes.

      (2) To the extent not covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, waterpipes (hookahs).

#### § § 966.4

      A lease shall be entered into between the PHA and each tenant of a dwelling unit which shall contain the provisions described hereinafter.

      (a)  (1) The lease shall state:

      (i) The names of the PHA and the tenant;

      (ii) The unit rented (address, apartment number, and any other information needed to identify the dwelling unit);

      (iii) The term of the lease (lease term and renewal in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section);

      (iv) A statement of what utilities, services, and equipment are to be supplied by the PHA without additional cost, and what utilities and appliances are to be paid for by the tenant;

      (v) The composition of the household as approved by the PHA (family members and any PHA-approved live-in aide). The family must promptly inform the PHA of the birth, adoption, or court-awarded custody of a child. The family must request PHA approval to add any other family member as an occupant of the unit;

      (vi) HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply.

      (2)  (i) The lease shall have a twelve month term. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the lease term must be automatically renewed for the same period.

      (ii) The PHA may not renew the lease if the family has violated the requirement for resident performance of community service or participation in an economic self-sufficiency program in accordance with part 960, subpart F of this chapter.

      (iii) The lease shall convert to a month-to-month term for families determined to be over-income whose tenancy will be terminated in accordance with § 960.507(d)(2) of this chapter as of the date of the notice provided under § 960.507(c)(3) of this chapter. PHAs must charge these families, who continue to be public housing program participants, the family's choice of income-based, flat rent, or prorated rent for mixed families during the period before termination.

      (iv) At any time, the PHA may terminate the tenancy in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section.

      (3)  The lease must be executed by the tenant and the PHA, except for automatic renewals of a lease. The lease may modified at any time by written agreement of the tenant and the PHA.

      (b) —(1)  (i) The tenant shall pay the amount of the monthly tenant rent determined by the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements. The amount of the tenant rent is subject to change in accordance with HUD requirements.

      (ii) The lease shall specify the initial amount of the tenant rent at the beginning of the initial lease term. The PHA shall give the tenant written notice stating any change in the amount of tenant rent, and when the change is effective.

      (2)  The lease shall provide for charges to the tenant for maintenance and repair beyond normal wear and tear and for consumption of excess utilities. The lease shall state the basis for the determination of such charges (e.g., by a posted schedule of charges for repair, amounts charged for utility consumption in excess of the allowance stated in the lease, etc.). The imposition of charges for consumption of excess utilities is permissible only if such charges are determined by an individual check meter servicing the leased unit or result from the use of major tenant-supplied appliances.

      (3)  At the option of the PHA, the lease may provide for payment of penalties for late payment.

      (4)  The lease shall provide that charges assessed under paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be due and collectible until two weeks after the PHA gives written notice of the charges. Such notice constitutes a notice of adverse action, and must meet the requirements governing a notice of adverse action (see § 966.4(e)(8)).

      (5)  At the option of the PHA, the lease may provide for security deposits which shall not exceed one month's rent or such reasonable fixed amount as may be required by the PHA. Provision may be made for gradual accumulation of the security deposit by the tenant. Subject to applicable laws, interest earned on security deposits may be refunded to the tenant on vacation of the dwelling unit or used for tenant services or activities.

      (c)  The lease shall provide for redetermination of rent and family composition which shall include:

      (1) The frequency of regular rental redetermination and the basis for interim redetermination.

      (2) An agreement by the tenant to furnish such information and certifications regarding family composition and income as may be necessary for the PHA to make determinations with respect to rent, eligibility, and the appropriateness of dwelling size.

      (3) An agreement by the tenant to transfer to an appropriate size dwelling unit based on family composition, upon appropriate notice by the PHA that such a dwelling unit is available.

      (4) When the PHA redetermines the amount of rent (Total Tenant Payment or Tenant Rent) payable by the tenant, not including determination of the PHA's schedule of Utility Allowances for families in the PHA's Public Housing Program, or determines that the tenant must transfer to another unit based on family composition, the PHA shall notify the tenant that the tenant may ask for an explanation stating the specific grounds of the PHA determination, and that if the tenant does not agree with the determination, the tenant shall have the right to request a hearing under the PHA grievance procedure.

      (d)  (1) The lease shall provide that the tenant shall have the right to exclusive use and occupancy of the leased unit by the members of the household authorized to reside in the unit in accordance with the lease, including reasonable accommodation of their _guest_s. The term  is defined in 24 CFR 5.100.

      (2) With the consent of the PHA, members of the household may engage in legal profitmaking activities in the dwelling unit, where the PHA determines that such activities are incidental to primary use of the leased unit for residence by members of the household.

      (3)(i) With the consent of the PHA, a foster child or a live-in aide may reside in the unit. The PHA may adopt reasonable policies concerning residence by a foster child or a live-in-aide, and defining the circumstances in which PHA consent will be given or denied. Under such policies, the factors considered by the PHA may include:

      (A) Whether the addition of a new occupant may necessitate a transfer of the family to another unit, and whether such units are available.

      (B) The PHA's obligation to make reasonable accommodation for handicapped persons.

      (ii)  means a person who resides with an elderly, disabled or handicapped person and who:

      (A) Is determined to be essential to the care and well-being of the person;

      (B) Is not obligated for the support of the person; and

      (C) Would not be living in the unit except to provide the necessary supportive services.

      (e)  The lease shall set forth the PHA's obligations under the lease, which shall include the following:

      (1) To maintain the dwelling unit and the project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition;

      (2) To comply with requirements of applicable building codes, housing codes, and HUD regulations materially affecting health and safety;

      (3) To make necessary repairs to the dwelling unit;

      (4) To keep project buildings, facilities, and common areas, not otherwise assigned to the tenant for maintenance and upkeep, in a clean and safe condition;

      (5) To maintain in good and safe working order and condition electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and other facilities and appliances, including elevators, supplied or required to be supplied by the PHA;

      (6) To provide and maintain appropriate receptacles and facilities (except containers for the exclusive use of an individual tenant family) for the deposit of ashes, garbage, rubbish, and other waste removed from the dwelling unit by the tenant in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section;

      (7) To supply running water and reasonable amounts of hot water and reasonable amounts of heat at appropriate times of the year (according to local custom and usage), except where the building that includes the dwelling unit is not required by law to be equipped for that purpose, or where heat or hot water is generated by an installation within the exclusive control of the tenant and supplied by a direct utility connection; and

      (8)(i) To notify the tenant of the specific grounds for any proposed adverse action by the PHA. (Such adverse action includes, but is not limited to, a proposed lease termination, transfer of the tenant to another unit, or imposition of charges for maintenance and repair, or for excess consumption of utilities.)

      (ii) When the PHA is required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA grievance procedure for a grievance concerning a proposed adverse action:

      (A) The notice of proposed adverse action shall inform the tenant of the right to request such hearing. In the case of a lease termination, a notice of lease termination, in accordance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section, shall constitute adequate notice of proposed adverse action.

      (B) In the case of a proposed adverse action other than a proposed lease termination, the PHA shall not take the proposed action until the time for the tenant to request a grievance hearing has expired, and (if a hearing was timely requested by the tenant) the grievance process has been completed.

      (9) To consider lease bifurcation, as provided in 24 CFR 5.2009, in circumstances involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking addressed in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), provided that, if a PHA chooses to bifurcate a lease, no assistance will be given for an individual who does not meet public housing eligibility and 24 CFR 5.508(h)(2) applies to submission of evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status.

      (f)  The lease shall provide that the tenant shall be obligated:

      (1) Not to assign the lease or to sublease the dwelling unit;

      (2) Not to provide accommodations for boarders or lodgers;

      (3) To use the dwelling unit solely as a private dwelling for the tenant and the tenant's household as identified in the lease, and not to use or permit its use for any other purpose;

      (4) To abide by necessary and reasonable regulations promulgated by the PHA for the benefit and well-being of the housing project and the tenants which shall be posted in the project office and incorporated by reference in the lease;

      (5) To comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants by applicable provisions of building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety;

      (6) To keep the dwelling unit and such other areas as may be assigned to the tenant for the tenant's exclusive use in a clean and safe condition;

      (7) To dispose of all ashes, garbage, rubbish, and other waste from the dwelling unit in a sanitary and safe manner;

      (8) To use only in a reasonable manner all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and other facilities and appurtenances including elevators;

      (9) To refrain from, and to cause the household and guests to refrain from destroying, defacing, damaging, or removing any part of the dwelling unit or project;

      (10) To pay reasonable charges (other than for wear and tear) for the repair of damages to the dwelling unit, or to the project (including damages to project buildings, facilities or common areas) caused by the tenant, a member of the household or a guest.

      (11) To act, and cause household members or guests to act, in a manner which will not disturb other residents' peaceful enjoyment of their accommodations and will be conducive to maintaining the project in a decent, safe and sanitary condition;

      (12) (i) To assure that no tenant, member of the tenant's household, or guest engages in:

      (A)  () Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents;

      () Any drug-related criminal activity on or off the premises; or

      (B)  For any units covered by 24 CFR part 965, subpart G, any smoking of prohibited tobacco products in restricted areas, as defined by 24 CFR 965.653(a), or in other outdoor areas that the PHA has designated as smoke-free.

      (ii) To assure that no other person under the tenant's control engages in:

      (A)  () Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents;

      () Any drug-related criminal activity on the premises; or

      (B)  For any units covered by 24 CFR part 965, subpart G, any smoking of prohibited tobacco products in restricted areas, as defined by 24 CFR 965.653(a), or in other outdoor areas that the PHA has designated as smoke-free.

      (iii) To assure that no member of the household engages in an abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol that affects the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (g)  The lease may provide that the tenant shall perform seasonal maintenance or other maintenance tasks, as specified in the lease, where performance of such tasks by tenants of dwellings units of a similar design and construction is customary:  That such provision is included in the lease in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the PHA. The PHA shall exempt tenants who are unable to perform such tasks because of age or disability.

      (h)  The lease shall set forth the rights and obligations of the tenant and the PHA if the dwelling unit is damaged to the extent that conditions are created which are hazardous to life, health, or safety of the occupants and shall provide that:

      (1) The tenant shall immediately notify project management of the damage;

      (2) The PHA shall be responsible for repair of the unit within a reasonable time:  That if the damage was caused by the tenant, tenant's household or guests, the reasonable cost of the repairs shall be charged to the tenant;

      (3) The PHA shall offer standard alternative accommodations, if available, where necessary repairs cannot be made within a reasonable time; and

      (4) Provisions shall be made for abatement of rent in proportion to the seriousness of the damage and loss in value as a dwelling if repairs are not made in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section or alternative accommodations not provided in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section, except that no abatement of rent shall occur if the tenant rejects the alternative accommodation or if the damage was caused by the tenant, tenant's household or guests.

      (i)  The lease shall provide that the PHA and the tenant or representative shall be obligated to inspect the dwelling unit prior to commencement of occupancy by the tenant. The PHA will furnish the tenant with a written statement of the condition of the dwelling unit, and the equipment provided with the unit. The statement shall be signed by the PHA and the tenant, and a copy of the statement shall be retained by the PHA in the tenant's folder. The PHA shall be further obligated to inspect the unit at the time the tenant vacates the unit and to furnish the tenant a statement of any charges to be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Provision shall be made for the tenant's participation in the latter inspection, unless the tenant vacates without notice to the PHA.

      (j)  The lease shall set forth the circumstances under which the PHA may enter the dwelling unit during the tenant's possession thereof, which shall include provision that:

      (1) The PHA shall, upon reasonable advance notification to the tenant, be permitted to enter the dwelling unit during reasonable hours for the purpose of performing routine inspections and maintenance, for making improvement or repairs, or to show the dwelling unit for re-leasing. A written statement specifying the purpose of the PHA entry delivered to the dwelling unit at least two days before such entry shall be considered reasonable advance notification;

      (2) The PHA may enter the dwelling unit at any time without advance notification when there is reasonable cause to believe that an emergency exists; and

      (3) If the tenant and all adult members of the household are absent from the dwelling unit at the time of entry, the PHA shall leave in the dwelling unit a written statement specifying the date, time and purpose of entry prior to leaving the dwelling unit.

      (k)  (1) The lease shall provide procedures to be followed by the PHA and the tenant in giving notice one to the other which shall require that:

      (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, notice to a tenant shall be in writing and delivered to the tenant or to an adult member of the tenant's household residing in the dwelling or sent by prepaid first-class mail properly addressed to the tenant; and

      (ii) Notice to the PHA shall be in writing, delivered to the project office or the PHA central office or sent by prepaid first-class mail properly addressed.

      (2) If the tenant is visually impaired, all notices must be in an accessible format.

      (l) —(1)  The lease shall state the procedures to be followed by the PHA and by the tenant to terminate the tenancy.

      (2)  The PHA may terminate the tenancy only for:

      (i) Serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease, such as the following:

      (A) Failure to make payments due under the lease;

      (B) Failure to fulfill household obligations, as described in paragraph (f) of this section;

      (ii) Being over the income limit for the program, as provided in 24 CFR 960.507.

      (iii) No longer meeting the restrictions on net assets and property ownership as provided in § 5.618 of this title.

      (iv) Other good cause. Other good cause includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      (A) Criminal activity or alcohol abuse as provided in paragraph (1)(5) of this section;

      (B) Discovery after admission of facts that made the tenant ineligible;

      (C) Discovery of material false statements or fraud by the tenant in connection with an application for assistance or with reexamination of income;

      (D) Failure of a family member to comply with service requirement provisions of part 960, subpart F, of this chapter—as grounds only for non-renewal of the lease and termination of tenancy at the end of the twelve-month lease term; and

      (E) Failure to accept the PHA's offer of a lease revision to an existing lease: that is on a form adopted by the PHA in accordance with § 966.3; with written notice of the offer of the revision at least 60 calendar days before the lease revision is scheduled to take effect; and with the offer specifying a reasonable time limit within that period for acceptance by the family.

      (3)  (i) The PHA must give written notice of lease termination of:

      (A) At least 30 days in the case of failure to pay rent;

      (B) A reasonable period of time considering the seriousness of the situation (but not to exceed 30 days):

      () If the health or safety of other residents, PHA employees, or persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises is threatened; or

      () If any member of the household has engaged in any drug-related criminal activity or violent criminal activity; or

      () If any member of the household has been convicted of a felony;

      (C) 30 days in any other case, except that if a State or local law allows a shorter notice period, such shorter period shall apply.

      (ii) The notice of lease termination to the tenant shall state specific grounds for termination, and shall inform the tenant of the tenant's right to make such reply as the tenant may wish. The notice shall also inform the tenant of the right (pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section) to examine PHA documents directly relevant to the termination or eviction. When the PHA is required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a grievance hearing, the notice shall also inform the tenant of the tenant's right to request a hearing in accordance with the PHA's grievance procedure. All notices of lease termination required by paragraph (1)(3)(i)(A) of this section due to a tenant's failure to pay rent must also include the following:

      (A) Instructions on how the tenant can cure the nonpayment of rent violation, including an itemized amount separated by month of alleged rent owed by the tenant, any other arrearages allowed by HUD and included in the lease separated by month, and the date by which the tenant must pay the amount of rent owed before an eviction for nonpayment of rent can be filed;

      (B) Information on how the tenant can recertify their income pursuant to 24 CFR 960.257(b), request a hardship exemption pursuant to 24 CFR 5.630(b), or request to switch from flat rent to income-based rent pursuant to 24 CFR 960.253(g); and

      (C) In the event of a Presidential declaration of a national emergency, such information as required by the Secretary.

      (iii) A notice to vacate which is required by State or local law may be combined with, or run concurrently with, a notice of lease termination under paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section.

      (iv) When the PHA is required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA grievance procedure for a grievance concerning the lease termination (see § 966.51(a)(1)), the tenancy shall not terminate (even if any notice to vacate under State or local law has expired) until the time for the tenant to request a grievance hearing has expired, and (if a hearing was timely requested by the tenant) the grievance process has been completed.

      (v) When the PHA is not required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA administrative grievance procedure for a grievance concerning the lease termination (see § 966.51(a)(2)), and the PHA has decided to exclude such grievance from the PHA grievance procedure, the notice of lease termination under paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section shall:

      (A) State that the tenant is not entitled to a grievance hearing on the termination.

      (B) Specify the judicial eviction procedure to be used by the PHA for eviction of the tenant, and state that HUD has determined that this eviction procedure provides the opportunity for a hearing in court that contains the basic elements of due process as defined in HUD regulations.

      (C) State whether the eviction is for a criminal activity as described in § 966.51(a)(2)(i)(A) or for a drug-related criminal activity as described in § 966.51(a)(2)(i)(B).

      (4)  The PHA may evict the tenant from the unit either:

      (i) By bringing a court action or;

      (ii) By bringing an administrative action if law of the jurisdiction permits eviction by administrative action, after a due process administrative hearing, and without a court determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. In order to evict without bringing a court action, the PHA must afford the tenant the opportunity for a pre-eviction hearing in accordance with the PHA grievance procedure.

      (5) —(i)  (A)  The PHA must immediately terminate the tenancy if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.

      (B)  The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or off the premises by any tenant, member of the tenant's household or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the PHA to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that a PHA may evict a family when the PHA determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the PHA determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (ii)  (A)  The lease must provide that any criminal activity by a covered person that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents (including PHA management staff residing on the premises) or threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises is grounds for termination of tenancy.

      (B)  The PHA may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.

      (iii)  (A)  The PHA may evict the tenant by judicial action for criminal activity in accordance with this section if the PHA determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction.

      (B)  When a PHA evicts an individual or family for criminal activity, the PHA must notify the local post office serving the dwelling unit that the individual or family is no longer residing in the unit.

      (iv)  If the PHA seeks to terminate the tenancy for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record before a PHA grievance hearing or court trial concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant must be given an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in the grievance hearing or court trial.

      (v)  The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.

      (vi)  The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of tenancy if the PHA determines that a household member has:

      (A) Engaged in abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or

      (B) Furnished false or misleading information concerning illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, or rehabilitation of illegal drug users or alcohol abusers.

      (vii)  (A)  Under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), PHAs that have adopted policies, implemented procedures and can document that they appropriately evict any public housing residents who engage in certain activity detrimental to the public housing community receive points. (See 24 CFR 902.43(a)(5).) This policy takes into account the importance of eviction of such residents to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.

      (B)  In a manner consistent with such policies, procedures and practices, the PHA may consider all circumstances relevant to a particular case such as the seriousness of the offending action, the extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action, the effects that the eviction would have on family members not involved in the offending activity and the extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action.

      (C)  The PHA may require a tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.

      (D)  In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use, or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13662). For this purpose, the PHA may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.

      (E)  If a statute requires that the PHA prohibit admission of persons for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, the PHA may apply that prohibition for a longer period of time.

      (F)  The PHA's eviction actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of § 5.105 of this title.

      (m)  The PHA shall provide the tenant a reasonable opportunity to examine, at the tenant's request, before a PHA grievance hearing or court trial concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, any documents, including records and regulations, which are in the possession of the PHA, and which are directly relevant to the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant shall be allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. A notice of lease termination pursuant to § 966.4(l) (3) shall inform the tenant of the tenant's right to examine PHA documents concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. If the PHA does not make documents available for examination upon request by the tenant (in accordance with this § 966.4(m)), the PHA may not proceed with the eviction.

      (n)  (1) The lease must provide that all disputes concerning the obligations of the tenant or the PHA must (except as provided in § 966.51(a)(2)) be resolved in accordance with the PHA grievance procedures. The grievance procedures must comply with subpart B of this part.

      (2) The lease must include a description of the PHA's policies for selecting a hearing officer.

      (o)  The lease shall provide that modification of the lease must be accomplished by a written rider to the lease executed by both parties, except for paragraph (c) of this section and § 966.5.

      (p)  The lease shall provide a signature clause attesting that the lease has been executed by the parties.

      § 966.50   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 966.50

      The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the requirements, standards and criteria for a grievance procedure to be established and implemented by public housing agencies (PHAs) to assure that a PHA tenant is afforded an opportunity for a hearing if the tenant disputes within a reasonable time any PHA action or failure to act involving the tenant's lease with the PHA or PHA regulations which adversely affect the individual tenant's rights, duties, welfare or status.

> [56 FR 51579, Oct. 11, 1991]

      § 966.51   Applicability.

#### § § 966.51

      (a)(1) The PHA grievance procedure shall be applicable (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) to all individual grievances as defined in § 966.53 of this subpart between the tenant and the PHA.

      (2)(i) The term  means a determination by HUD that law of the jurisdiction requires that the tenant must be given the opportunity for a hearing in court which provides the basic elements of due process (as defined in § 966.53(c)) before eviction from the dwelling unit. If HUD has issued a _due process determination_, a PHA may exclude from the PHA administrative grievance procedure under this subpart any grievance concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction that involves:

      (A) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other residents or employees of the PHA;

      (B) Any violent or drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises; or

      (C) Any criminal activity that resulted in felony conviction of a household member.

      (iii) For guidance of the public, HUD will publish in the  a notice listing the judicial eviction procedures for which HUD has issued a due process determination. HUD will make available for public inspection and copying a copy of the legal analysis on which the determinations are based.

      (iv) If HUD has issued a due process determination, the PHA may evict the occupants of the dwelling unit through the judicial eviction procedures which are the subject of the determination. In this case, the PHA is not required to provide the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA's administrative grievance procedure.

      (b) The PHA grievance procedure shall not be applicable to disputes between tenants not involving the PHA or to class grievances. The grievance procedure is not intended as a forum for initiating or negotiating policy changes between a group or groups of tenants and the PHA's Board of Commissioners.

A PHA may establish an expedited grievance procedure as defined in § 966.53.

      (b) The PHA grievance procedure shall be included in, or incorporated by reference in, all tenant dwelling leases pursuant to subpart A of this part.

      (c) The PHA shall provide at least 30 days notice to tenants and resident organizations setting forth proposed changes in the PHA grievance procedure, and providing an opportunity to present written comments. Subject to requirements of this subpart, comments submitted shall be considered by the PHA before adoption of any grievance procedure changes by the PHA.

      (d) The PHA shall furnish a copy of the grievance procedure to each tenant and to resident organizations.

      (e) The PHA must not only meet the minimal procedural due process requirements contained in this subpart but also satisfy any additional requirements required by local, state, or federal law.

#### § § 966.54

      Any grievance shall be personally presented, either orally or in writing, to the PHA office or to the office of the project in which the complainant resides so that the grievance may be discussed informally and settled without a hearing. A summary of such discussion shall be prepared within a reasonable time and one copy shall be given to the tenant and one retained in the PHA's tenant file.

      (1) The opportunity to examine before the grievance hearing any PHA documents, including records and regulations, that are directly relevant to the hearing. (For a grievance hearing concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, see also § 966.4(m).) The tenant shall be allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. If the PHA does not make the document available for examination upon request by the complainant, the PHA may not rely on such document at the grievance hearing.

      (2) The right to be represented by counsel or other person chosen as the tenant's representative and to have such person make statements on the tenant's behalf;

      (3) The right to a private hearing unless the complainant requests a public hearing;

      (5) A decision based solely and exclusively upon the facts presented at the hearing.

      (c) If the complainant or the PHA fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the hearing officer may make a determination to postpone the hearing for no more than 5 business days or may make a determination that the party has waived his right to a hearing. Both the complainant and the PHA must be notified of the determination by the hearing officer. A determination that the complainant has waived the complainant's right to a hearing will not constitute a waiver of any right the complainant may have to contest the PHA's disposition of the grievance in an appropriate judicial proceeding.

      (d) At the hearing, the complainant must first make a showing of an entitlement to the relief sought and thereafter the PHA must sustain the burden of justifying the PHA action or failure to act against which the complaint is directed.

      (e) The complainant or the PHA may arrange, in advance and at the expense of the party making the arrangement, for a transcript of the hearing. Any interested party may purchase a copy of such transcript.

      (f)  (1) The PHA must provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities to participate in the hearing. Reasonable accommodation may include qualified sign language interpreters, readers, accessible locations, or attendants.

      (2) If the tenant is visually impaired, any notice to the tenant which is required under this subpart must be in an accessible format.

      (g)  PHAs must comply with HUD's “Final Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons” issued on January 22, 2007 and available at

      § 966.57   Decision of the hearing officer.

#### § § 966.57

      (a) The hearing officer must prepare a written decision, including the reasons for the PHA's decision within a reasonable time after the hearing. A copy of the decision must be sent to the complainant and the PHA. The PHA must retain a copy of the decision in the tenant's folder. The PHA must maintain a log of all hearing officer decisions and make that log available upon request of the hearing officer, a prospective complainant, or a prospective complainant's representative.

      (b) The decision of the hearing officer will be binding on the PHA unless the PHA Board of Commissioners determines that:

      (1) The grievance does not concern PHA action or failure to act in accordance with or involving the complainant's lease on PHA regulations, which adversely affects the complainant's rights, duties, welfare or status; or

      (2) The decision of the hearing officer is contrary to applicable Federal, State or local law, HUD regulations or requirements of the annual contributions contract between HUD and the PHA.

      (c) A decision by the hearing officer or Board of Commissioners in favor of the PHA or which denies the relief requested by the complainant in whole or in part will not constitute a waiver of, nor affect in any manner whatever, any rights the complainant may have to a trial de novo or judicial review in any judicial proceedings, which may thereafter be brought in the matter.

Section 970.29 specifies criteria for disapproval of an application. Approval of the application under this part does not imply approval of a request for additional funding, which the PHA must make separately under a program that makes available funding for this purpose. The PHA shall submit the application for demolition or disposition and the timetable in a time and manner and in a form prescribed by HUD. The supporting information shall include:

    (1) A certification that the PHA has described the demolition or disposition in the PHA Annual Plan and timetable under 24 CFR part 903 (except in the case of small or high-performing PHAs eligible for streamlined annual plan treatment), and that the description in the PHA Annual Plan is identical to the application submitted pursuant to this part and otherwise complies with section 18 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p) and this part;

    (6) If applicable, a plan for the relocation of tenants who would be displaced by the proposed demolition or disposition (including persons with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodations and a relocation timetable as prescribed in § 970.21);

    (7) A description with supporting evidence of the PHA's consultations with residents, any resident organizations, and the Resident Advisory Board, as required under § 903.9 of this title;

    (13) A copy of a resolution by the PHA's Board of Commissioners approving the specific demolition or disposition application (or, in the case of the report required under § 970.27(e) for “de minimis” demolitions, the Board of Commissioner's resolution approving the “de minimis” action) for that development or developments or portions thereof. The resolution must be signed and dated after all resident and local government consultation has been completed;

    (14) Evidence that the application was developed in consultation with appropriate government officials as defined in § 970.5, including:

    (i) A description of the process of consultation with local government officials, which summarizes dates, meetings, and issues raised by the local government officials and the PHA's responses to those issues;

    (ii) A signed and dated letter in support of the application from the chief executive officer of the unit of local government that demonstrates that the PHA has consulted with the appropriate local government officials on the proposed demolition or disposition;

    (iii) Where the local government consistently fails to respond to the PHA's attempts at consultation, including letters, requests for meetings, public notices, and other reasonable efforts, documentation of those attempts;

    (iv) Where the PHA covers multiple jurisdictions (such as a regional housing authority), the PHA must meet these requirements for each of the jurisdictions where the PHA is proposing demolition or disposition of PHA property;

    (b)  (1) HUD will consider a PHA's request to rescind an earlier approval to demolish or dispose of public housing property, where a PHA submits a resolution from the Board of Commissioners and submits documentation that the conditions that originally led to the request for demolition or disposition have significantly changed or been removed.

    (2) The Assistant Secretary will not approve any request by the PHA to either substitute units or add units to those originally included in the approved demolition or disposition application, unless the PHA submits a new application for those units that meet the requirements of this part.

    § 970.9   Resident participation—consultation and opportunity to purchase.

#### § § 970.9

    (a)  PHAs must consult with residents who will be affected by the proposed action with respect to all demolition or disposition applications. The PHA must provide with its application evidence that the application was developed in consultation with residents who will be affected by the proposed action, any resident organizations for the development, PHA-wide resident organizations that will be affected by the demolition or disposition, and the Resident Advisory Board (RAB). The PHA must also submit copies of any written comments submitted to the PHA and any evaluation that the PHA has made of the comments.

    (b)  In the situation where the PHA applies to dispose of a development or portion of a development:

    (1) The PHA shall, in appropriate circumstances as determined by the Assistant Secretary, initially offer the property proposed for disposition to any eligible resident organization, eligible resident management corporation as defined in 24 CFR part 964, or to a nonprofit organization acting on behalf of the residents at any development proposed for disposition, if the resident entity has expressed an interest in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing. The entity must make the request in writing to the PHA, no later than 30 days after the resident entity has received the notification of sale from the PHA;

    (2) If the resident entity has expressed an interest in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing, the entity, in order for its purchase offer to be considered, must:

    (i) In the case of a nonprofit organization, be acting on behalf of the residents of the development; and

    (ii) Demonstrate that it has obtained a firm commitment for the necessary financing within 60 days of serving its written notice of interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (3) The requirements of this section do not apply to the following cases, which have been determined not to present an appropriate opportunity for purchase by a resident organization:

    (i) A unit of state or local government requests to acquire vacant land that is less than two acres in order to build or expand its public services (a local government wishes to use the land to build or establish a police substation); or

    (ii) A PHA seeks disposition outside the public housing program to privately finance or otherwise develop a facility to benefit low-income families (e.g., day care center, administrative building, mixed-finance housing under 24 CFR part 941 subpart F, or other types of low-income housing);

    (iii) Units that have been legally vacated in accordance with the HOPE VI program, the regulations at 24 CFR part 971, or the mandatory conversion regulations at 24 CFR part 972, excluding developments where the PHA has consolidated vacancies;

    (iv) Distressed units required to be converted to tenant-based assistance under section 33 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5); or

    (v) Disposition of non-dwelling properties, including administration and community buildings, and maintenance facilities.

    (4) If the requirements of this section are not applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the PHA may proceed to submit to HUD its application under this part to dispose of the property, or a portion of the property, without affording an opportunity for purchase by a resident organization. However, PHAs must consult with their residents in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The PHA must submit documentation with date and signatures to support the applicability of one of the exceptions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Examples of appropriate documentation include, but are not limited to: a letter from the public body that wants to acquire the land, copies of memoranda or letters approving the PHA's previous application under part 970 or mandatory conversion plan, and the HUD transmittal document approving the proposed revitalization plan.

    (c)  Where there are eligible resident organizations, eligible resident management corporations as defined in 24 CFR part 964, or nonprofit organizations acting on behalf of the residents as defined in 24 CFR part 964 (collectively, “established eligible organizations”), that have expressed an interest, in writing, to the PHA within 30 days of the date of notification of the proposed sale, in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing at the affected development, the PHA shall follow the procedures for making the offer described in § 970.11.

    § 970.11   Procedures for the offer of sale to established eligible organizations.

#### § § 970.11

    In making an offer of sale to established eligible organizations as defined in § 970.9(c) in the case of proposed disposition, the PHA shall proceed as follows:

    (a)  The PHA shall send an initial written notification to each established eligible organization (for purposes of this section, an established eligible organization that has been so notified is a “notified eligible organization”) of the proposed sale of the property. The notice of sale must include, at a minimum, the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section;

    (b)  All notified eligible organizations shall have 30 days to initially express an interest, in writing, in the offer (“initial expression of interest”). The initial expression of interest need not contain details regarding financing, acceptance of an offer of sale, or any other terms of sale.

    (c)  If a notified eligible organization expresses interest in writing during the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, no disposition of the property shall occur during the 60-day period beginning on the date of the receipt of the written notice of interest. During this period, the PHA must give the entity expressing interest an opportunity to obtain a firm financial commitment as defined in § 970.5 for the financing necessary to purchase the property;

    (d)  The initial written notification to established eligible organizations under paragraph (a) of this section must include at a minimum the following:

    (1) An identification of the development, or portion of the development, involved in the proposed disposition, including the development number and location, the number of units and bedroom configuration, the amount and use of non-dwelling space, the current physical condition (fire damaged, friable asbestos, lead-based paint test results), and percent of occupancy;

    (2) A copy of the appraisal of the property and any terms of sale;

    (3) Disclosure and description of the PHA's plans for reuse of land, if any, after the proposed disposition;

    (4) An identification of available resources (including its own and HUD's) to provide technical assistance to the organization to help it to better understand its opportunity to purchase the development, the development's value, and potential use;

    (5) A statement that public housing developments sold to resident organizations will not continue to receive capital and operating subsidy after the completion of the sale;

    (6) Any and all terms of sale that the PHA will require, including a statement that the purchaser must use the property for low-income housing. If the PHA does not know all the terms of the offer of sale at the time of the notice of sale, the PHA shall include all the terms of sale of which it is aware. The PHA must supply the totality of all the terms of sale and all necessary material to the residents no later than 3 business days from the day it receives the residents' initial expression of interest;

    (7) A date by which an established eligible organization must express its interest, in writing, in response to the PHA's offer to sell the property proposed for demolition or disposition, which shall be up to 30 days from the date of the official written offer of sale from the PHA;

    (8) A statement that the established eligible organization will be given 60 days from the date of the PHA's receipt of its letter expressing interest to develop and submit a proposal to the PHA to purchase the property and to obtain a firm financial commitment, as defined in § 970.5. The statement shall explain that the PHA shall approve the proposal from an organization if the proposal meets the terms of sale and is supported by a firm commitment for financing. The statement shall also provide that the PHA can consider accepting an offer from the organization that differs from the terms of sale. The statement shall explain that if the PHA receives proposals from more than one organization, the PHA shall select the proposal that meets the terms of sale, if any. In the event that two proposals from the development to be sold meet the terms of sale, the PHA shall choose the best proposal. If no proposal meets the terms of sale, the PHA in its discretion may or may not select the best proposal.

    (e)  The established eligible organization or organizations have up to 30 days to respond to the notice of sale from the PHA. The established eligible organization shall respond to the PHA's notice of sale by means of an initial expression of interest under paragraph (b) of this section.

    (f)  The established eligible organization has up to 60 days from the date the PHA receives its initial expression of interest and provides all necessary terms and information to prepare and submit a proposal to the PHA for the purchase of the property of which the PHA plans to dispose, and to obtain a firm commitment for financing. The resident's proposal shall provide all the information requested in paragraph (i) of this section.

    (g)  The PHA has up to 60 days from the date of receipt of the proposal or proposals to review the proposals and determine whether they meet the terms of sale described in the PHA's offer or offers. If the PHA determines that the proposal meets the terms of sale, within 14 days of the date of this determination, the PHA shall notify the organization of that fact and that the proposal has been accepted. If the PHA determines that the proposal differs from the terms of sale, the PHA may accept or reject the proposal at its discretion;

    (h)  The established eligible organization has the right to appeal the PHA's decision to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or his designee, by sending a letter of appeal within 30 days of the date of the PHA's decision to the field office director. The letter of appeal must include copies of the proposal and any related correspondence, along with a statement of reasons why the organization believes the PHA should have decided differently. HUD shall render a decision within 30 days, and notify the organization and the PHA by letter within 14 days of such decision. If HUD cannot render a decision within 30 days, HUD will so notify the PHA and the established eligible organization in writing, in which case HUD will have an additional 30 days in which to render a decision. HUD may continue to extend its time for decision in 30-day increments for a total of 120 days. Once HUD renders its decision, there is no further administrative appeal or remedy available.

    (i)  The established eligible organization's proposal shall at a minimum include the following:

    (1) The length of time the organization has been in existence;

    (2) A description of current or past activities that demonstrate the organization's organizational and management capability, or the planned acquisition of such capability through a partner or other outside entities (in which case the proposal should state how the partner or outside entity meets this requirement);

    (3) To the extent not included in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the organization's experience in the development of low-income housing, or planned arrangements with partners or outside entities with such experience (in which case the proposal should state how the partner or outside entity meets this requirement);

    (4) A statement of financial capability;

    (5) A description of involvement of any non-resident organization (such as non-profit, for-profit, governmental, or other entities), if any, the proposed division of responsibilities between the non-resident organization and the established eligible organization, and the non-resident organization's financial capabilities;

    (6) A plan for financing the purchase of the property and a firm financial commitment as stated in paragraph (c) of this section for funding resources necessary to purchase the property and pay for any necessary repairs;

    (7) A plan for using the property for low-income housing;

    (8) The proposed purchase price in relation to the appraised value;

    (9) Justification for purchase at less than the fair market value in accordance with § 970.19(a) of this part, if appropriate;

    (10) Estimated time schedule for completing the transaction;

    (11) Any additional items necessary to respond fully to the PHA's terms of sale;

    (12) A resolution from the resident organization approving the proposal; and

    (13) A proposed date of settlement, generally not to exceed 6 months from the date of PHA approval of the proposal, or such period as the PHA may determine to be reasonable.

    (j)  The PHA must:

    (1) Prepare and distribute the initial notice of sale pursuant to 24 CFR 970.11(a), and, if any established eligible organization expresses an interest, any further documents necessary to enable the organization or organizations to make an offer to purchase;

    (2) Evaluate proposals received, make the selection based on the considerations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and issue letters of acceptance or rejection;

    (3) Prepare certifications, where appropriate, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section;

    (4) Comply with its obligations under § 970.7(a) regarding tenant consultation and provide evidence to HUD that the PHA has met those obligations. The PHA shall not act in an arbitrary manner and shall give full and fair consideration to any offer from a qualified resident management corporation, resident council of the affected development, or a nonprofit organization acting on behalf of the residents, and shall accept the proposal if the proposal meets the terms of sale.

    (k)  After the resident offer, if any, is made, the PHA shall:

    (1) Submit its disposition application to HUD in accordance with section 18 of the Act and this part. The disposition application must include complete documentation that the resident offer provisions of this part have been met. This documentation shall include:

    (i) A copy of the signed and dated PHA notification letter(s) to each established eligible organization informing them of the PHA's intention to submit an application for disposition, the organization's right to purchase the property to be disposed of; and

    (ii) The responses from each organization.

    (2)(i) If the PHA accepts the proposal of an established eligible organization, the PHA shall submit revisions to its disposition application to HUD in accordance with section 18 of the Act and this part reflecting the arrangement with the resident organization, with appropriate justification for a negotiated sale and for sale at less than fair market value, if applicable.

    (ii) If the PHA rejects the proposal of the resident organization, the resident organization may appeal as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Once the appeal is resolved, or, if there is no appeal, and the 30 days allowed for appeal has passed, HUD shall proceed to approve or disapprove the application.

    (3) HUD will not process an application for disposition unless the PHA provides HUD with one of the following:

    (i) An official board resolution or its equivalent from each established eligible organization stating that such organization has received the PHA offer, and that it understands the offer and waives its opportunity to purchase the project, or portion of the project, covered by the disposition application;

    (ii) A certification from the executive director or board of commissioners of the PHA that the 30-day time frame to express interest has expired and no response was received to its offer; or

    (iii) A certification from the executive director or board of commissioners of the PHA with supporting documentation that the offer was otherwise rejected.

    § 970.13   Environmental review requirements.

#### § § 970.13

    (a) Activities under this part (including de minimis demolition pursuant to § 970.27) are subject to HUD environmental regulations in 24 CFR part 58. However, HUD may make a finding in accordance with 24 CFR 58.11(d) of this title and may itself perform the environmental review under the provisions of 24 CFR part 50 if a PHA objects in writing to the responsible entity performing the review under 24 CFR part 58.

    (b) The environmental review is limited to the demolition or disposition action and any known re-use, and is not required for any unknown future re-use. Factors that indicate that the future site reuse can reasonably be considered to be known include the following:

    (1) Private, Federal, state, or local funding for the site reuse has been committed;

    (2) A grant application involving the site has been filed with the Federal government or a state or local unit of government;

    (3) The Federal government or a state or unit of local government has made a commitment to take an action, including a physical action, that will facilitate a particular reuse of the site; and

    (4) Architectural, engineering, or design plans for the reuse exist that go beyond preliminary stages.

    (c) In the case of a demolition or disposition made necessary by a disaster that the President has declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121  or a disaster that has been declared under state law by the officer or entity with legal authority to make such declaration, pursuant to 24 CFR 50.43 and 24 CFR 58.33, the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.11 will apply.

    § 970.15   Specific criteria for HUD approval of demolition requests.

#### § § 970.15

    (a) In addition to other applicable requirements of this part, HUD will approve an application for demolition upon the PHA's certification that it meets the following statutory criteria, unless the application meets the criteria for disapproval under 24 CFR 970.29. An application for the demolition of all or a portion of a public housing project must certify that the project:

    (1) Is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unsuitable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of modifications is cost-effective to return the public housing project or portion of the project to useful life; and

    (2) In the case of an application for demolition of a portion of a project, the demolition will help to ensure the viability of the remaining portion of the project.

    (b) As to paragraph (a)(1) of this section:

    (1) Major problems indicative of obsolescence are:

    (i) As to physical condition: Structural deficiencies that cannot be corrected in a cost-effective manner (settlement of earth below the building caused by inadequate structural fills, faulty structural design, or settlement of floors), or other design or site problems (severe erosion or flooding);

    (ii) As to location: physical deterioration of the neighborhood; change from residential to industrial or commercial development; or environmental conditions as determined by HUD environmental review in accord with 24 CFR part 50, which jeopardize the suitability of the site or a portion of the site and its housing structures for residential use; or

    (iii) There are other factors that have seriously affected the marketability, usefulness, or management of the property.

    (2) HUD generally shall not consider a program of modifications to be cost-effective if the costs of such program exceed 62.5 percent of total development cost (TDC) for elevator structures and 57.14 percent of TDC for all other types of structures in effect at the time the application is submitted to HUD.

    (c) As to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a partial demolition will be considered to ensure the viability of the remaining portion if the application certifies that the demolition will reduce development density to permit better access by emergency, fire, or rescue services, or improve marketability by reducing the density to that of the neighborhood or other developments in the PHA's inventory.

    § 970.17   Specific criteria for HUD approval of disposition requests.

#### § § 970.17

    In addition to other applicable requirements of this part, HUD will approve a request for disposition by sale or other transfer of a public housing project or other real property if the PHA certifies that the retention of the property is not in the best interests of the residents or the PHA for at least one of the following reasons, unless information available to HUD is inconsistent with the certification:

    (a) Conditions in the area surrounding the project (density, or industrial or commercial development) adversely affect the health or safety of the tenants or the feasible operation of the project by the PHA;

    (b) Disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties that will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing developments;

    (c) The PHA has otherwise determined the disposition to be appropriate for reasons that are consistent with the goals of the PHA and the PHA Plan and that are otherwise consistent with the Act;

    (d) In the case of disposition of property other than dwelling units (community facilities or vacant land), the PHA certifies that:

    (1) The non-dwelling facilities or land exceeds the needs of the development (after DOFA); or

    (2) The disposition of the property is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of the remaining portion of the development.

    § 970.19   Disposition of property; use of proceeds.

#### § § 970.19

    (a) Where HUD approves the disposition of real property of a development, in whole or in part, the PHA shall dispose of the property promptly for not less than fair market value (in which case there is no showing of commensurate public benefit required), unless HUD authorizes negotiated sale for reasons found to be in the best interests of the PHA or the federal government; or dispose of the property for sale for less than fair market value (where permitted by state law), based on commensurate public benefits to the community, the PHA, or the federal government justifying such an exception. General public improvements, such as streets and bridges, do not qualify as commensurate public benefits.

    (b) A PHA may pay the reasonable costs of disposition, and of relocation of displaced tenants allowable under § 970.21, out of the gross proceeds, as approved by HUD.

    (c) To obtain an estimate of the fair market value before the property is advertised for bid, the PHA shall have one independent appraisal performed on the property proposed for disposition, unless HUD determines that:

    (1) More than one appraisal is warranted; or

    (2) Another method of valuation is clearly sufficient and the expense of an independent appraisal is unjustified because of the limited nature of the property interest involved or other available data.

    (d) To obtain an estimate of the fair market value when a property is not publicly advertised for bid, HUD may accept a reasonable valuation of the property.

    (e) A PHA shall use net proceeds, including any interest earned on the proceeds (after payment of HUD-approved costs of disposition and relocation under paragraph (a) of this section), subject to HUD approval, as follows:

    (1) Unless waived by HUD, for the retirement of outstanding obligations, if any, issued to finance original development or modernization of the project; and

    (2) To the extent that any net proceeds remain, after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for:

    (i) The provision of low-income housing or to benefit the residents of the PHA, through such measures as modernization of lower-income housing or the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties to operate as lower-income housing; or

    (ii) Leveraging amounts for securing commercial enterprises, on-site in public housing developments of the PHA, appropriate to serve the needs of the residents.

    (f) For dispositions for the purpose stated in § 970.17(b), a PHA must demonstrate to the satisfaction of HUD that the replacement units are being provided in connection with the disposition of the property. A PHA may use sale proceeds in accordance with paragraph (e) to fund the replacement units.

    § 970.21   Relocation of residents.

#### § § 970.21

    (a)  A PHA must offer each family displaced by demolition or disposition comparable housing that meets housing quality standards (HQS) and is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced persons. The housing must be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, creed, national origin, handicap, age, familial status, or gender, in compliance with applicable Federal and state laws. For persons with disabilities displaced from a unit with reasonable accommodations, comparable housing should include similar accommodations. Such housing may include:

    (1) Tenant-based assistance, such as assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982, except that such assistance will not be considered “comparable housing” until the family is actually relocated into such housing;

    (2) Project-based assistance; or

    (3) Occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA at a rental rate paid by the family that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the family is vacated.

    (b)  A PHA may not complete disposition of a building until all tenants residing in the building are relocated.

    (c)  (1) Sources of funding for relocation costs related to demolition or disposition may include, but are not limited to, capital funds or other federal funds currently available for this purpose;

    (2) If Federal financial assistance under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, 42 U.S.C. 5301  (including loan guarantees under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5308 ); the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program, 42 U.S.C. 5318  or HOME program, 42 U.S.C. 12701  is used in connection with the demolition or disposition of public housing, the project is subject to section 104(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5304(d) (as amended)), including the relocation payment provisions and the anti-displacement provisions, which require that comparable replacement dwellings be provided within the community for the same number of occupants as could have been housed in the occupied and vacant, occupiable low- and moderate-income units demolished or converted to another use.

    (d)  For the purpose of determining operating subsidy eligibility under 24 CFR part 990, a PHA must provide the following information in the application or immediately following application submission:

    (1) The number of occupied units at the time of demolition/disposition application approval;

    (2) A schedule for the relocation of those residents on a month-by-month basis.

    (e) The PHA is responsible for the following:

    (1) Notifying each family residing in the development of the proposed demolition or disposition 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health and safety. The notification must include a statement that:

    (i) The development or portion of the development will be demolished or disposed of;

    (ii) The demolition of the building in which the family resides will not commence until each resident of the building has been relocated;

    (iii) Each family displaced by such action will be provided comparable housing, which may include housing with reasonable accommodations for disability, if required under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 8, as described in paragraph (a) of this section;

    (2) Providing for the payment of the actual and reasonable relocation expenses of each resident to be displaced, including residents requiring reasonable accommodations because of disabilities;

    (3) Ensuring that each displaced resident is offered comparable replacement housing as described in paragraph (b) of this section; and

    (4) Providing any necessary counseling for residents that are displaced.

    (f) In addition, the PHA's plan for the relocation of residents who would be displaced by the proposed demolition or disposition must indicate:

    (1) The number of individual residents to be displaced;

    (2) The type of counseling and advisory services the PHA plans to provide;

    (3) What housing resources are expected to be available to provide housing for displaced residents; and

    (4) An estimate of the costs for counseling and advisory services and resident moving expenses, and the expected source for payment of these costs.

    (g) The Uniform Relocation Act does not apply to demolitions and dispositions under this part.

    § 970.23   Costs of demolition and relocation of displaced tenants.

#### § § 970.23

    Where HUD has approved demolition of a project, or a portion of a project, and the proposed action is part of a program under the Capital Fund Program (24 CFR part 905), the costs of demolition and of relocation of displaced residents may be included in the budget funded with capital funds pursuant to section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) or awarded HOPE VI or other eligible HUD funds.

    § 970.25   Required and permitted actions prior to approval.

#### § § 970.25

    (a) A PHA may not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing development or a portion of a public housing development without obtaining HUD approval under this part. HUD funds may not be used to pay for the cost to demolish or dispose of a public housing development or a portion of a public housing development, unless HUD approval has been obtained under this part. Until the PHA receives HUD approval, the PHA shall continue to meet its ACC obligations to maintain and operate the property as housing for low-income families. However, the PHA may engage in planning activities, analysis, or consultations without seeking HUD approval. Planning activities may include project viability studies, capital planning, or comprehensive occupancy planning. The PHA must continue to provide full housing services to all residents that remain in the development. A PHA should not re-rent these units at turnover while HUD is considering its application for demolition or disposition. However, the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility will continue to be calculated as stated in 24 CFR part 990.

    (b) A PHA may consolidate occupancy within or among buildings of a development, or among developments, or with other housing for the purposes of improving living conditions of, or providing more efficient services to residents, without submitting a demolition or disposition application.

    § 970.27   De minimis exception to demolition requirements.

#### § § 970.27

    (a) A PHA may demolish units without submitting an application if the PHA is proposing to demolish not more than the lesser of:

    (1) five dwelling units; or

    (2) 5 percent of the total dwelling units owned by the PHA over any 5-year period.

    (b) The 5-year period referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is the 5 years counting backward from the date of the proposed de minimis demolition, except that any demolition performed prior to October 21, 1998, will not be counted against the five units or 5 percent of the total, as applicable. For example, if a PHA that owns 1,000 housing units wishes to demolish units under this de minimis provision on July 1, 2004, and previously demolished two units under this provision on September 1, 2000, and two more units on July 1, 2001, the PHA would be able to demolish one additional unit for a total of five in the preceding 5 years. As another example, if a PHA that owns 60 housing units as of July 1, 2004, had demolished two units on September 1, 2000, and one unit on July 1, 2001, that PHA would not be able to demolish any further units under this “de minimis” provision until after September 1, 2005, because it would have already demolished 5 percent of its total.

    (c)(1) In order to qualify for this exemption, the space occupied by the demolished unit must be used for meeting the service or other needs of public housing residents (use of space to construct a laundry facility, community center, child care facility, office space for a general provider; or for use as open space or garden); or

    (2) The unit being demolished must be beyond repair.

    (d) PHAs utilizing this section will comply with environmental review requirements at 24 CFR 970.13 and, if applicable, the requirements of 24 CFR 8.23.

    (e) For recordkeeping purposes, PHAs that wish to demolish units under this section shall submit the information required in § 970.7(a)(1), (2), (12), (13), and (14). HUD will accept a certification from the PHA that one of the two conditions in paragraph (c) of this section apply unless HUD has independent information that requirements for “de minimis” demolition have not been met.

    § 970.29   Criteria for disapproval of demolition or disposition applications.

#### § § 970.29

    HUD will disapprove an application if HUD determines that:

    (a) Any certification made by the PHA under this part is clearly inconsistent with:

    (1) The PHA Plan;

    (2) Any information and data available to HUD related to the requirements of this part, such as failure to meet the requirements for the justification for demolition or disposition as found in §§ 970.15 or 970.17; or

    (3) Information or data requested by HUD; or

    (b) The application was not developed in consultation with:

    (1) Residents who will be affected by the proposed demolition or disposition as required in § 970.9; and

    (2) Each resident advisory board and resident council, if any, of the project (or portion thereof) that will be affected by the proposed demolition or disposition as required in § 970.9, and appropriate government officials as required in § 970.7.

    § 970.31   Replacement units.

#### § § 970.31

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, replacement public housing units may be built on the original public housing location or in the same neighborhood as the original public housing location if the number of the replacement public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of units demolished. Such development must comply with 24 CFR part 905, Public Housing Capital Fund Program, as well as 24 CFR part 941.

    § 970.33   Effect on the Operating Fund Program and Capital Fund Program.

#### § § 970.33

    The provisions of 24 CFR part 990, the Public Housing Operating Fund Program, and 24 CFR part 905, the Public Housing Capital Fund Program, apply.

    § 970.35   Reports and records.

#### § § 970.35

    (a) After HUD approval of demolition or disposition of all or part of a project, the PHA shall provide information on the following:

    (1) Actual completion of each demolition contract by entering the appropriate information into HUD's applicable data system, or providing the information by another method HUD may require, within a week of making the final payment to the demolition contractor, or expending the last remaining funds if funded by force account;

    (2) Execution of sales or lease contracts by entering the appropriate information into HUD's applicable data system, or providing the information by another method HUD may require, within a week of execution;

    (3) The PHA's use of the proceeds of sale by providing a financial statement showing how the funds were expended by item and dollar amount;

    (4) Amounts expended for closing costs and relocation expenses, by providing a financial statement showing this information for each property sold; and

    (5) Such other information as HUD may from time to time require.

    (b) [Reserved]

  PART 971—ASSESSMENT OF THE REASONABLE REVITALIZATION POTENTIAL OF CERTAIN PUBLIC HOUSING REQUIRED BY LAW

### Part 971

**Authority:** Authority: Pub. L. 104-134; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 62 FR 49576, Sept. 22, 1997, unless otherwise noted.

    § 971.1   Purpose.

#### § § 971.1

    Section 202 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub.L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) (“OCRA”) requires PHAs to identify certain distressed public housing developments that cost more than Section 8 rental assistance and cannot be reasonably revitalized. Households in occupancy that will be affected by the activities will be offered tenant-based or project-based assistance (that can include other public housing units) and will be relocated, to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice. After residents are relocated, the distressed developments (or affected buildings) for which no reasonable means of revitalization exists will be removed from the public housing inventory.

    § 971.3   Standards for identifying developments.

#### § § 971.3

    (a) PHAs shall use the following standards for identifying developments or portions thereof which are subject to section 202's requirement that PHAs develop and carry out plans for the removal over time from the public housing inventory. These standards track section 202(a) of OCRA. The development, or portions thereof, must:

    (1)  (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(1)). This standard and the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section refer to the actual number and location of units, irrespective of HUD development project numbers.

    (2)  (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(2)).

    (3)  (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(3)). For this determination, PHAs and HUD shall use the data the PHA relied upon for its last Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (Report on Occupancy), or more recent data which demonstrates improvement in occupancy rates. Units in the following categories shall not be included in this calculation:

    (i) Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;

    (ii) Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but only if State law requires the property to be left in the unit for some period of time, and only for the period stated in the law;

    (iii) Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only until the insurance claim is adjusted; and

    (iv) Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that are utilized for resident services.

    (4)  (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(5)).

    (i) For purposes of this determination, the costs used for public housing shall be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as described in the paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

    (ii) These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization costs and accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost of continuing the development as public housing.

    (iii) That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost.

    (iv) Both the method to be used and an example are included in the Appendix to this part.

    (5)  (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(4)). [See § 971.5.]

    (b) Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section will be assumed to be “distressed” unless the PHA can show that the property fails the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for reasons that are temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.

    (c) Where the PHA will demolish all of the units in a development, or the portion thereof, that is subject to section 202, section 202 requirements will be satisfied once the demolition occurs and its standards will not be applied further to the use of the site.

    (d) PHAs will meet the test for assuring long-term viability of identified housing only if it is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least twenty years (or at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy; will not be excessively densely configured relative to standards for similar (typically family) housing in the community; will not constitute an excessive concentration of very low-income families; and has no other site impairments which clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.

    § 971.5   Long-term viability.

#### § § 971.5

    (a)  (1) Proposed revitalization costs for viability must be reasonable. Such costs must not exceed, and ordinarily would be substantially less than, 90 percent of HUD's total development cost limit for the units proposed to be revitalized (100 percent of the total development cost limit for any “infill” new construction subject to this regulation). The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent comprehensive plan for modernization is to be used for this purpose, unless a PHA demonstrates or HUD determines that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

    (2) The overall projected cost of the revitalized development must not exceed the Section 8 cost under the method contained in the Appendix to this part, even if the cost of revitalization is a lower percentage of the TDC than the limits stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (3) The source of funding for such a revitalization program must be identified and already available. In addition to other resources already available to the PHA, a PHA may assume that future formula funds provided through the Comprehensive Grant Program are available for this purpose, provided that they are sufficient to permit completion of the revitalization within the statutory five year time frame. (Comprehensive plans must be amended accordingly.)

    (b)  Density reduction measures would have to result in a public housing community with a density approaching that which prevails in the community for similar types of housing (typically family), or a lower density. If the development's density already meets this description, further reduction in density is not a requirement.

    (c)  (1) Measures generally will be required to broaden the range of resident incomes to include over time a significant mix of households with at least one full-time worker (for example, at least 20 percent with an income at least 30 percent of median area income). Measures to achieve a broader range of household incomes must be realistic in view of the site's location. Evidence of such realism typically would include some mix of incomes of other households located in the same census tract or neighborhood, or unique advantages of the public housing site.

    (2) For purposes of judging appropriateness of density reduction and broader range of income measures, overall size of the public housing site and its number of dwelling units will be considered. The concerns these measures would address generally are greater as the site's size and number of dwelling units increase.

    § 971.7   Plan for removal of units from public housing inventories.

#### § § 971.7

    (a)  Section 202 is a continuing requirement, and the Secretary will establish time frames for submission of necessary information annually through publication of a  notice.

    (b)  With respect to any development that meets all of the standards listed, the PHA shall develop a plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory. The plan should consider relocation alternatives for households in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance, and shall provide for relocation from the units as soon as possible. For planning purposes, PHAs shall assume that HUD will be able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental assistance. The plan shall include:

    (1) A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the inventory;

    (2) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size;

    (3) Identification and obligation status of any previously approved CIAP, modernization, or major reconstruction funds for the distressed development and PHA recommendations concerning transfer of these funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;

    (4) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing;

    (5) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory;

    (6) Provision for notifying families residing in the development, in a timely fashion, that the development shall be removed from the public housing inventory; informing such families that they will receive tenant-based or project-based assistance; providing any necessary counselling with respect to the relocation, including a request for any necessary counseling funds; and assuring that such families are relocated as necessary to other decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;

    (7) The displacement and relocation provisions set forth in 24 CFR 970.5.

    (8) A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected development and the unit of local government where the public housing is located, as set forth in § 971.9.

    (c) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 shall not apply to demolition of developments removed from PHA inventories under this section, but shall apply to any proposed dispositions of such developments or their sites. HUD's review of any such disposition application will take into account that the development has been required to be removed from the PHA's inventory.

    (d) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility under the Performance Funding System (PFS), the submitted plan will be considered the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and ACC and approval (or acceptance). The PHA will receive written notification that the plan has been approved (or accepted). Units that are vacant or vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of this chapter and also will be provided the phase-down of subsidy pursuant to § 990.114 of this chapter.

    § 971.9   Tenant and local government consultation.

#### § § 971.9

    (a) PHAs are required to proceed in consultation with affected public housing residents. PHAs must provide copies of their submissions complying with §§ 971.3(a) (1) through (3) to the appropriate tenant councils and resident groups before or immediately after these submissions are provided to HUD.

    (b) PHAs must:

    (1) Hold a meeting with the residents of the affected sites and explain the requirements of section 202 of OCRA;

    (2) Provide an outline of the submission(s) complying with § 971.3(a) (4) and (5) to affected residents; and

    (3) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents and must provide a summary of the resident comments to HUD.

    (c) PHAs must prepare conversion plans in consultation with affected tenants and must:

    (1) Hold a meeting with affected residents and provide draft copies of the plan; and

    (2) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents and must provide a summary of the resident comments to HUD.

    (d) The conversion plan must be approved by the local officials as not inconsistent with the Consolidated Plan.

    § 971.11   HOPE VI developments.

#### § § 971.11

    Developments with HOPE VI implementation grants that have approved HOPE VI revitalization plans will be treated as having shown the ability to achieve long-term viability with reasonable revitalization plans. Future HUD actions to approve or deny proposed HOPE VI implementation grant revitalization plans will be taken with consideration of the standards for section 202. Developments with HOPE VI planning or implementation grants, but without approved HOPE VI revitalization plans, are fully subject to section 202 standards and requirements.

    § 971.13   HUD enforcement authority.

#### § § 971.13

    Section 202 provides HUD authority to ensure that certain distressed developments are properly identified and removed from PHA inventories. Specifically, HUD may:

    (a) Direct a PHA to cease additional spending in connection with a development which meets or is likely to meet the statutory criteria, except as necessary to ensure decent, safe and sanitary housing until an appropriate course of action is approved;

    (b) Identify developments which fall within the statutory criteria where a PHA has failed to do so properly;

    (c) Take appropriate actions to ensure the removal of developments from the inventory where the PHA has failed to adequately develop or implement a plan to do so; and

    (d) Authorize or direct the transfer of capital funds committed to or on behalf of the development (including comprehensive improvement assistance, comprehensive grant amounts attributable to the development's share of funds under the formula, and major reconstruction of obsolete projects funds) to tenant-based assistance or appropriate site revitalization for the agency.

  PART 972—CONVERSION OF PUBLIC HOUSING TO TENANT-BASED ASSISTANCE

### Part 972

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437t, 1437z-5, and 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 66 FR 33618, June 22, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Required Conversion of Public Housing Developments

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 54608, Sept. 17, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

      Purpose; Definition of Conversion

        § 972.100   Purpose.

#### § § 972.100

        The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 33 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5), which requires PHAs to annually review their public housing inventory and identify developments, or parts of developments, which must be removed from its stock of public housing operated under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD.

        This subpart provides the procedures a PHA must follow to develop and carry out a conversion plan to remove the units from the public housing inventory, including how to provide for the transition for residents of these developments to other affordable housing.

        § 972.103   Definition of “conversion.”

#### § § 972.103

        For purposes of this subpart, the term “conversion” means the removal of public housing units from the inventory of a PHA, and the provision of tenant-based or project-based assistance for the residents of the public housing units that are being removed. The term “conversion,” as used in this subpart, does not necessarily mean the physical removal of the public housing development.

      Required Conversion Process

        § 972.106   Procedure for required conversion of public housing developments to tenant-based assistance.

#### § § 972.106

        (a) A PHA must annually review its public housing inventory and identify developments, or parts of developments, which must be converted to tenant-based assistance, in accordance with §§ 972.121-972.127.

        (b) With respect to any public housing development that is identified under paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA generally must develop a 5-year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory, in accordance with §§ 972.130-972.136.

        (c) The PHA may proceed to convert the development if HUD approves the conversion plan.

        § 972.109   Conversion of developments.

#### § § 972.109

        (a)(1) The PHA may proceed to convert the development covered by a conversion plan after receiving written approval from HUD. This approval will be separate from the approval that the PHA receives for its Annual Plan.

        (2) HUD anticipates that its review of a conversion plan will ordinarily occur within 90 days following submission of a complete plan by the PHA. A longer process may be required where HUD's initial review of the plan raises questions that require further discussion with the PHA. In any event, HUD will provide all PHAs with a preliminary response within 90 days following submission of a conversion plan.

        (b) The PHA may not demolish or dispose of units or property until completion of the required environmental review under part 58 of this title (if a responsible entity has assumed environmental responsibility for the project) or part 50 of this title (if HUD is performing the environmental review). Further, HUD will not approve a conversion plan until completion of the required environmental review. However, before completion of the environmental review, HUD may approve the targeted units for removal from the PHA's inventory and may authorize the PHA to undertake other activities proposed in its conversion plan that do not require environmental review (such as certain activities related to the relocation of residents), as long as the buildings in question are adequately secured and maintained.

        (c) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility, HUD will consider the conversion plan the PHA submits to be the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and ACC. HUD will notify the PHA in writing whether it has approved the conversion plan. Units that are vacant or vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of this title and also will be provided any phase-down of subsidy to which the PHA is entitled pursuant to § 990.114 of this title.

        (d) The PHA may apply for tenant-based assistance in accordance with Section 8 program requirements, and HUD will give the PHA a priority for receiving tenant-based assistance to replace the public housing units. It is HUD's policy to provide funds for one-for-one replacement housing with either public housing or tenant-based assistance, if funds are available. HUD may require that funding for the initial year be provided from the public housing Capital Fund, Operating Fund, or both.

        § 972.112   Relationship between required conversion and demolition/disposition requirements.

#### § § 972.112

        (a) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 does not apply to demolition of developments removed from the inventory of the PHA under this subpart. Demolition of these developments is therefore not subject to section 18(g), which provides an exclusion from the applicability of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA). Accordingly, the URA will apply to the displacement of tenants as the direct result of the demolition of a development carried out pursuant to this subpart, in accordance with § 972.118. With respect to any such demolition, the PHA must comply with the requirements for environmental review found at part 58 of this title.

        (b) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 does apply to any disposition of developments removed from the inventory of the PHA under this subpart. Therefore, to dispose of property, the PHA must submit a disposition application under section 18. HUD's review of any such disposition application will take into account that the development has been required to be converted.

        § 972.115   Relationship between required conversions and HOPE VI developments.

#### § § 972.115

        HUD actions to approve or deny proposed HOPE VI revitalization plans must be consistent with the requirements of this subpart. Developments with HOPE VI revitalization grants, but without approved HOPE VI revitalization plans, are fully subject to required conversion standards under this subpart.

        § 972.118   Applicability of Uniform Relocation Act.

#### § § 972.118

        To the extent that tenants are displaced as a direct result of the demolition, acquisition, or rehabilitation of federally-assisted property converted pursuant to this subpart, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA), and the implementing regulations issued by the Department of Transportation at 49 CFR part 24, apply.

      Identifying Developments Subject to Required Conversion

        § 972.121   Developments subject to this subpart.

#### § § 972.121

        (a) This subpart is applicable to any development not identified before October 21, 1998, for conversion, or for assessment of whether such conversion is required, in accordance with section 202 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 1321-279—1321-281). Developments identified before October 21, 1998, continue to be subject to the requirements of section 202 and part 971 of this chapter until these requirements are satisfied. Thereafter, the provisions of this subpart apply to any remaining public housing on the sites of those developments.

        (b) The developments to which this subpart is applicable are subject to the requirements of section 33 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5).

        (c) The provisions of this subpart cease to apply when the units in a development that are subject to the requirements of this subpart have been demolished.

        § 972.124   Standards for identifying public housing developments subject to required conversion.

#### § § 972.124

        The development, or portions thereof, must be converted if it is a general occupancy development of 250 or more dwelling units and it meets the following criteria:

        (a)  This refers to the actual number and location of units, irrespective of HUD development project numbers.

        (b)  (1) For a conversion analysis performed on or before March 16, 2009, the specified vacancy rate is 15 percent. For a conversion analysis performed after that date, the specified vacancy rate is 12 percent.

        (2) For the determination of vacancy rates, the PHA must use the data it relied upon for the PHA's latest Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (report on Occupancy). Units in the following categories must not be included in this calculation:

        (i) Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;

        (ii) Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but only if state law requires the property to be left in the unit for some period of time, and only for the period of time stated in the law;

        (iii) Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only until the insurance claim is adjusted;

        (iv) Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that are used for resident services; and

        (v) Units that HUD determines, in its sole discretion, are intentionally vacant and do not indicate continued distress.

        (c)  (1) The development is distressed housing for which the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing through reasonable revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of a broader range of household income. (See § 972.127)

        (i) Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be assumed to be “distressed,” unless HUD determines that the reasons a property meets such standards are temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.

        (ii) A development satisfies the long-term viability test only if it is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least 20 years (or at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy; will not be excessively densely configured relative to other similar rental (typically family) housing in the community; can achieve a broader range of family income; and has no other site impairments that clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.

        (2) The development is more expensive for the PHA to operate as public housing than to provide tenant-based assistance if it has an estimated cost, during the remaining useful life of the project, of continued operation and modernization of the development as public housing in excess of the cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for all families in occupancy, based on appropriate indicators of cost (such as the percentage of total development cost required for modernization).

        (i) For purposes of this determination, the costs used for public housing must be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (ii) These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization costs, and accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost of continuing the development as public housing.

        (iii) That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost.

        (iv) The cost methodology necessary to conduct the cost comparisons for required conversions has not yet been finalized. PHAs are not required to undertake conversions under this subpart until six months after the effective date of the cost methodology, which will be announced in the  Once effective, the cost methodology will be codified as an appendix to this part.

        § 972.127   Standards for determining whether a property is viable in the long term.

#### § § 972.127

        In order for a property to meet the standard of long-term viability, as discussed in § 972.124, the following criteria must be met:

        (a)  (1) Proposed revitalization costs for viability must be reasonable. Such costs must not exceed, and ordinarily would be substantially less than, 90 percent of HUD's total development cost (TDC) limit for the units proposed to be revitalized (100 percent of the total development cost limit for any “infill” new construction subject to this regulation). The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent Annual Plan or 5-Year Plan is to be used for this purpose, unless the PHA demonstrates, or HUD determines, that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2) The overall projected cost of the revitalized development must not exceed the Section 8 cost under the method contained in the Appendix to this part, even if the cost of revitalization is a lower percentage of the TDC than the limits stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (3) The source of funding for such a revitalization program must be identified and available. In addition to other resources already available to the PHA, it may assume that future formula funds provided through the Capital Fund over five years are available for this purpose.

        (b)  The resulting public housing development must have a density which is comparable to that which prevails in or is appropriate for assisted rental housing or for other similar types of housing in the community (typically family).

        (c)  (1) Measures generally will be required to broaden the range of resident incomes over time to include a significant mix of households with at least one full-time worker. Measures to achieve a broader range of household incomes must be realistic in view of the site's location. Appropriate evidence typically would include census or other recent statistical evidence demonstrating some mix of incomes of other households located in the same census tract or neighborhood, or unique advantages of the public housing site.

        (2) For purposes of judging appropriateness of density reduction and broader range of income measures, overall size of the public housing site and its number of dwelling units will be considered. The concerns these measures would address generally are greater as the site's size and number of dwelling units increase.

      Conversion Plans

        § 972.130   Conversion plan components.

#### § § 972.130

        (a) With respect to any development that is identified under §§ 972.121 through 972.127, the PHA generally must develop a 5-year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory. The plan must consider relocation alternatives for households in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance, and must provide for relocation from the units as soon as possible. For planning purposes, the PHA must assume that HUD will be able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental assistance. The plan must include:

        (1) A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the inventory;

        (2) Identification and obligation status of any previously approved modernization, reconstruction, or other capital funds for the distressed development and the PHA's recommendations concerning transfer of these funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;

        (3) A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected development and the unit of local government where the public housing is located, as set forth in § 972.133;

        (4) A description of the plans for demolition or disposition of the public housing units; and

        (5) A relocation plan, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  The relocation plan must incorporate all of the information identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. In addition, if the required conversion is subject to the URA, the relocation plan must also contain the information identified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The relocation plan must incorporate the following:

        (1) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, and by the number of accessible units.

        (2) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.

        (3) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families displaced by the conversion).

        (4) Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in the development in accordance with the following requirements:

        (i)  If the required conversion is not subject to the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days before displacement. If the required conversion is subject to the URA the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a required conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.

        (ii)  The written notice shall include all of the following:

        (A) The development must be removed from the public housing inventory and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;

        (B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon the relocation of the family into such housing);

        (C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);

        (D) Such families will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;

        (E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent; and

        (F) Where section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement.

        (5) If the required conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (b)(4) must also provide that:

        (i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing, as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;

        (ii) Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208;

        (iii) The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family may be eligible under this subpart and URA;

        (iv) Families residing in the development will be provided with the URA Notice of Relocation Eligibility or Notice of Non-displacement (as applicable) as of the date HUD approves the conversion plan (for purposes of this subpart, the date of HUD's approval of the conversion plan shall be the “date of initiation of negotiations” as that term is used in URA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24); and

        (v) Any family that moves into the development after submission of the conversion plan to HUD will also be eligible for relocation assistance, unless the PHA issues a written move-in notice to the family prior to leasing and occupancy of the unit advising the family of the development's possible conversion, the impact of the conversion on the family, and that the family will not be eligible for relocation assistance.

        (c) The conversion plan may not be more than a 5-year plan, unless the PHA applies for and receives approval from HUD for a longer period of time. HUD may allow the PHA up to 10 years to remove the units from the inventory, in exceptional circumstances where HUD determines that this is clearly the most cost effective and beneficial means of providing housing assistance over that same period. For example, HUD may allow a longer period of time to remove the units from the public housing inventory, where more than one development is being converted, and a larger number of families require relocation than can easily be absorbed into the rental market at one time, provided the housing has a remaining useful life of longer than five years and the longer time frame will assist in relocation.

        § 972.133   Public and resident consultation process for developing a conversion plan.

#### § § 972.133

        (a) The PHA must consult with appropriate public officials and with the appropriate public housing residents in developing the conversion plan.

        (b) The PHA may satisfy the requirement for consultation with public officials by obtaining a certification from the appropriate government official that the conversion plan is consistent with the applicable Consolidated Plan. This may be the same certification as is required for the PHA Annual Plan that includes the conversion plan, so long as the certification specifically addresses the conversion plan.

        (c) To satisfy the requirement for consultation with the appropriate public housing residents, in addition to the public participation requirements for the PHA Annual Plan, the PHA must:

        (1) Hold at least one meeting with the residents of the affected sites (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question) at which the PHA must:

        (i) Explain the requirements of this section, especially as they apply to the residents of the affected developments; and

        (ii) Provide draft copies of the conversion plan to the residents;

        (2) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents; and

        (3) Summarize the resident comments for HUD, in the conversion plan, and consider these comments in developing the final conversion plan.

        § 972.136   Timing of submission of conversion plans to HUD.

#### § § 972.136

        The requirements of this section are on-going requirements. If the PHA must submit a plan for conversion, it must submit the conversion plan as part of the PHA's Annual Plan, beginning with PHA fiscal years that commence six months after the effective date of HUD's final rule establishing the cost methodology for required conversions.

      HUD Actions With Respect to Required Conversions

        § 972.139   HUD actions with respect to required conversions.

#### § § 972.139

        (a) HUD will take appropriate steps to ensure that distressed developments subject to this subpart are properly identified and converted. If a PHA fails to properly identify a development for required conversion, or does not submit a conversion plan for a development in the PHA Annual Plan following the Annual Plan in which the development was identified as subject to required conversion, HUD will take the actions described in paragraph (b) of this section, and may also take any or all of the actions described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) If a PHA fails to take the conversion activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will:

        (1) Disqualify the PHA from HUD funding competitions; and

        (2) Direct the PHA to cease additional spending in connection with a development that meets, or is likely to meet the statutory criteria, except to the extent that failure to expend such amounts would endanger health or safety.

        (c) If a PHA fails to take the conversion activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD may also take any or all of the following actions:

        (1) Identify developments that fall within the statutory criteria where the PHA has failed to do so properly;

        (2) Take appropriate actions to ensure the conversion of developments where the PHA has failed to adequately develop or implement a conversion plan;

        (3) Require the PHA to revise the conversion plan, or prohibit conversion, where HUD has determined that the PHA has erroneously identified a development as being subject to the requirements of this section;

        (4) Authorize or direct the transfer of capital or operating funds committed to or on behalf of the development (including comprehensive improvement assistance, comprehensive grant or Capital Fund amounts attributable to the development's share of funds under the formula, and major reconstruction of obsolete projects funds) to tenant-based assistance or appropriate site revitalization for the agency; and

        (5) Any other action that HUD determines appropriate and has the authority to undertake.

    Subpart B—Voluntary Conversion of Public Housing Developments

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 54619, Sept. 17, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

      Purpose; Definition of Conversion

        § 972.200   Purpose.

#### § § 972.200

        This subpart implements section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t). The purposes of this subpart are to:

        (a) Require PHAs to perform an assessment which considers developments for which conversion of public housing may be appropriate; and

        (b) Provide a basis for a PHA to take action for conversion on a voluntary basis.

        § 972.203   Definition of “conversion.”

#### § § 972.203

        For purposes of this subpart, the term “conversion” means the removal of public housing units from the inventory of a Public Housing Agency (PHA), and the provision of tenant-based, or project-based assistance for the residents of the public housing that is being removed. The term “conversion,” as used in this subpart, does not necessarily mean the physical removal of the public housing development from the site.

      Required Initial Assessments

        § 972.206   Required initial assessments.

#### § § 972.206

        (a)  A PHA must conduct a required initial assessment (which consists of the certification described in paragraph (b) of this section), in accordance with this section, once for each of its developments, unless:

        (1) The development is subject to required conversion under 24 CFR part 971;

        (2) The development is the subject of an application for demolition or disposition that has not been disapproved by HUD;

        (3) A HOPE VI revitalization grant has been awarded for the development; or

        (4) The development is designated for occupancy by the elderly and/or persons with disabilities ( is not a general occupancy development).

        (b)  For each development, the PHA shall certify that it has:

        (1) Reviewed the development's operation as public housing;

        (2) Considered the implications of converting the public housing to tenant-based assistance; and

        (3) Concluded that conversion of the development may be:

        (i) Appropriate because removal of the development would meet the necessary conditions for voluntary conversion described in § 972.224; or

        (ii) Inappropriate because removal of the development would not meet the necessary conditions for voluntary conversion described § 972.224.

        (c)  A PHA must maintain documentation of the reasoning with respect to each required initial assessment.

        (d)  Consistent with statutory submission requirements, the results of each required initial assessment (consisting of the certification described in paragraph (b) of this section) must be submitted to HUD as part of the next PHA Annual Plan after its completion.

      Voluntary Conversion Procedure

        § 972.209   Procedure for voluntary conversion of public housing developments to tenant-based assistance.

#### § § 972.209

        A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing development to tenant-based assistance must comply with the following process:

        (a) The PHA must perform a conversion assessment, in accordance with §§ 972.218-972.224 and submit it to HUD as part of the next PHA Annual Plan submission.

        (b) The PHA must prepare a conversion plan, in accordance with § 972.227-972.233, and submit it to HUD, as part of its PHA Annual Plan, within one year after submitting the conversion assessment. The PHA may submit the conversion plan in the same Annual Plan as the conversion assessment.

        (c) The PHA may proceed to convert the development if HUD approves the conversion plan.

        § 972.212   Timing of voluntary conversion.

#### § § 972.212

        (a) A PHA may proceed to convert a development covered by a conversion plan only after receiving written approval of the conversion plan from HUD. This approval will be separate from the approval that the PHA receives for its PHA Annual Plan. A PHA may apply for tenant-based assistance in accordance with Section 8 program requirements and will be given priority for receiving tenant-based assistance to replace the public housing units.

        (b) A PHA may not demolish or dispose of units or property until completion of the required environmental review under part 58 of this title (if a Responsible Entity has assumed environmental responsibility for the project) or part 50 of this title (if HUD is performing the environmental review). Further, HUD will not approve a conversion plan until completion of the required environmental review. However, before completion of the environmental review, HUD may approve the targeted units for deprogramming and may authorize the PHA to undertake other activities proposed in the conversion plan that do not require environmental review (such as certain activities related to the relocation of residents), as long as the buildings in question are adequately secured and maintained.

        (c) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility, the submitted conversion plan will be considered the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). Units that are vacant or are vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of this title, and will also be provided the phase down of subsidy pursuant to § 990.114 of this title.

        (d) HUD may require that funding for the initial year of tenant-based assistance be provided from the public housing Capital Fund, Operating Fund, or both.

        § 972.215   Applicability of the Uniform Relocation Act.

#### § § 972.215

        To the extent that tenants are displaced as a direct result of the demolition, acquisition, or rehabilitation of federally-assisted property converted under this subpart, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA), and the implementing regulations issued by the Department of Transportation at 49 CFR part 24, apply.

      Conversion Assessments

        § 972.218   Conversion assessment components.

#### § § 972.218

        The conversion assessment contains five elements, as described below:

        (a)  A PHA must conduct a cost analysis comparing the cost of providing Section 8 tenant-based assistance with the cost of continuing to operate the development as public housing for the remainder of its useful life. The cost methodology necessary to conduct the cost comparisons for voluntary conversions has not yet been finalized. PHAs may not undertake conversions under this subpart until the effective date of the cost methodology, which will be announced in the  Once effective, the cost methodology will be codified as an appendix to this part.

        (b)  (1) A PHA must have an independent appraisal conducted to compare the market value of the development before and after rehabilitation. In both cases, the market value must be based on the use of the development as public housing.

        (2) In addition, the appraisal must compare:

        (i) The market value of the development before rehabilitation, based on the use of the development as public housing, with the market value of the development after conversion; with

        (ii) The market value of the development after rehabilitation, based on the use of the development as public housing, with the market value of the development after conversion.

        (3) A copy of the appraisal findings and the analysis of market value of the development in the conversion assessment must be provided in the conversion assessment.

        (c)  (1) A PHA must conduct an analysis of the likely success of using tenant-based assistance for the residents of the public housing development. This analysis must include an assessment of the availability of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling units rented at or below the applicable Section 8 payment standard established for the jurisdiction or designated part of the FMR area in which the development is located.

        (2) In conducting this assessment, a PHA must take into account:

        (i) Its overall use of rental vouchers under lease and the success rates of using Section 8 tenant-based assistance in the community for the appropriate bedroom sizes, including recent success rates for units renting at or below the established payment standard; and

        (ii) Any particular characteristics of the specific residents of the public housing which may affect their ability to be housed (such as large household size or the presence of an elderly or disabled family member).

        (d)  A PHA must describe the likely impact of conversion of the public housing development on the neighborhood in which the public housing is located. This must include:

        (1) The impact on the availability of affordable housing in the neighborhood;

        (2) The impact on the concentration of poverty in the neighborhood; and

        (3) Other substantial impacts on the neighborhood.

        (e)  If a PHA intends to convert the development (or a portion of it) to tenant-based assistance, the conversion assessment must include a description of any actions the PHA plans to take in converting the development. This must include a general description of the planned future uses of the development, and the means and timetable for accomplishing such uses.

> [68 FR 54619, Sept. 17, 2003, as amended at 89 FR 38293, May 7, 2024]

        § 972.221   Timing of submission of conversion assessments to HUD.

#### § § 972.221

        (a)  A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing development to tenant-based assistance must submit a conversion assessment to HUD with its next PHA Annual Plan.

        (b)  Where a PHA proposes to convert a development to tenant-based assistance, it must submit an updated conversion assessment if the conversion assessment otherwise would be more than one year older than the conversion plan to be submitted to HUD. To update a conversion assessment, a PHA must ensure that the analysis of rental market conditions is based on the most recently available data, and must include any data that have changed since the initial conversion assessment. A PHA may submit the initial cost analysis and comparison of the market value of the public housing before and after rehabilitation and/or conversion if there is no reason to believe that such information has changed significantly.

        § 972.224   Necessary conditions for HUD approval of conversion.

#### § § 972.224

        (a)  In order to convert a public housing development, the PHA must conduct a conversion assessment that demonstrates that the conversion of the development:

        (1) Will not be more expensive than continuing to operate the development (or portion of it) as public housing;

        (2) Will principally benefit the residents of the public housing development (or portion thereof) to be converted, the PHA, and the community; and

        (3) Will not adversely affect the availability of affordable housing in the community.

        (b) —(1)  The relative expense of continuing operation as public housing or conversion to tenant-based assistance may be demonstrated by the cost analysis and market value analysis.

        (2)  (i) The benefit to residents, the PHA, and the community may be demonstrated in the rental market analysis, the analysis of the impact on the neighborhood, the market value analysis, and the proposed future use of the development. In determining whether a conversion will principally benefit residents, the PHA, and the community, HUD will consider whether the conversion will conflict with any litigation settlement agreements, voluntary compliance agreements, or other remedial agreements signed by the PHA with HUD.

        (ii) In making the determination of whether a conversion would principally benefit residents, the PHA, and the community, the PHA must consider such factors as the availability of landlords providing tenant-based assistance, as well as access to schools, jobs, and transportation.

        (iii) To determine the benefit to residents, the PHA must hold at least one public meeting with residents of the affected site (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question). At the meeting, the PHA must:

        (A) Explain the requirements of section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and these regulations, especially as they apply to residents of affected developments;

        (B) Provide draft copies of the conversion assessment to the residents; and

        (C) Provide the residents with a reasonable period of time to submit comments on the draft conversion assessment.

        (iv) The conversion assessment submitted to HUD must contain a summary of the resident comments, and the PHA responses to any significant issues raised by the commenters.

        (3)  The impact on affordable housing may be demonstrated in the rental market analysis and the analysis of the impact of conversion on the neighborhood.

      Conversion Plans

        § 972.227   Public and resident consultation process for developing a conversion plan.

#### § § 972.227

        (a) A conversion plan must be developed in consultation with appropriate public officials and with significant participation by residents of the development.

        (b) The requirement for consultation with public officials may be satisfied by obtaining a certification from the appropriate state or local officials that the conversion plan is consistent with that jurisdiction's Consolidated Plan. This may be the same certification as is required for the PHA Annual Plan that includes the conversion plan, so long as the certification specifically addresses the conversion plan.

        (c) To satisfy the requirement for significant participation by residents of the development, in addition to the public participation requirements for the PHA Annual Plan, a PHA must:

        (1) Hold at least one meeting with the residents of the affected sites (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question) at which the PHA must:

        (i) Explain the requirements of section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and these regulations, especially as they apply to residents of affected developments; and

        (ii) Provide draft copies of the conversion plan to them.

        (2) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents; and

        (3) Summarize the resident comments (as well as the PHA responses to the significant issues raised by the commenters) for HUD, and consider these comments in developing the final conversion plan.

        § 972.230   Conversion plan components.

#### § § 972.230

        A conversion plan must:

        (a) Describe the conversion and future use or disposition of the public housing development. If the future use of the development is demolition or disposition, the PHA is not required to submit a demolition or disposition application, so long as the PHA submits, and HUD approves, a conversion plan that includes a description of the future uses of the development.

        (b) Include an impact analysis of the conversion on the affected community. This may include the description that is required as part of the conversion assessment.

        (c) Include a description of how the conversion plan is consistent with the findings of the conversion assessment undertaken in accordance with § 972.218.

        (d) Include a summary of the resident comments received when developing the conversion plan, and the PHA responses to the significant issues raised by the commenters (including a description of any actions taken by the PHA as a result of the comments).

        (e) Confirm that any proceeds received from the conversion are subject to the limitations under section 18(a)(5) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437p(a)(5)) applicable to proceeds resulting from demolition or disposition.

        (f) Summarize why the conversion assessment for the public housing project supports the three conditions necessary for conversion described in § 972.224.

        (g) Include a relocation plan that incorporates all of the information identified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section. In addition, if the required conversion is subject to the URA, the relocation plan must also contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The relocation plan must incorporate the following:

        (1) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, by the number of accessible units.

        (2) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.

        (3) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families displaced by the conversion).

        (4) Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in the development in accordance with the following requirements:

        (i)  If the voluntary conversion is not subject to the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days before displacement. If the voluntary conversion is subject to the URA the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a voluntary conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.

        (ii)  The written notice shall include all of the following:

        (A) The development will no longer be used as public housing and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;

        (B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon relocation of the family into such housing);

        (C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);

        (D) The family will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;

        (E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent;

        (F) Where Section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement;

        (5)  If the voluntary conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (g)(4) must also provide that:

        (i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing as provided in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;

        (ii) Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208.

        (iii) The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family may be eligible under this subpart and URA.

        (iv) Families residing in the development will be provided with the URA Notice of Relocation Eligibility or Notice of Non-displacement (as applicable) as of the date HUD approves the conversion plan (for purposes of this subpart, the date of HUD's approval of the conversion plan shall be the “date of initiation of negotiations” as that term is used in URA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24).

        (v) Any family that moves into the development after submission of the conversion plan to HUD will also be eligible for relocation assistance, unless the PHA issues a written move-in notice to the family prior to leasing and occupancy of the unit advising the family of the development's possible conversion, the impact of the conversion on the family, and that the family will not be eligible for relocation assistance.

        § 972.233   Timing of submission of conversion plans to HUD.

#### § § 972.233

        A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing project to tenant-based assistance must submit a conversion plan to HUD. A PHA must prepare a conversion plan, in accordance with § 972.230, and submit it to HUD, as part of the next PHA Annual Plan within one year after submitting the full conversion assessment, or as a significant amendment to that Annual Plan. The PHA may also submit the conversion plan in the same Annual Plan as the conversion assessment.

        § 972.236   HUD process for approving a conversion plan.

#### § § 972.236

        Although a PHA will submit its conversion plan to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan, the conversion plan will be treated separately for purposes of HUD approval. A PHA needs a separate written approval from HUD in order to proceed with conversion. HUD anticipates that its review of a conversion plan will ordinarily occur within 90 days following submission of a complete plan by the PHA. A longer process may be required where HUD's initial review of the plan raises questions that require further discussion with the PHA. In any event, HUD will provide all PHAs with a preliminary response within 90 days following submission of a conversion plan. A lack of a HUD response within this time frame will constitute automatic HUD approval of the conversion plan.

        § 972.239   HUD actions with respect to a conversion plan.

#### § § 972.239

        (a) When a PHA submits a conversion plan to HUD, HUD will review it to determine whether:

        (1) The conversion plan is complete and includes all of the information required under § 972.230; and

        (2) The conversion plan is consistent with the conversion assessment the PHA submitted.

        (b) HUD will disapprove a conversion plan only if HUD determines that:

        (1) The conversion plan is plainly inconsistent with the conversion assessment;

        (2) There is reliable information and data available to the Secretary that contradicts the conversion assessment; or

        (3) The conversion plan is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements under § 972.230.

      § 982.1   Programs: purpose and structure.

#### § § 982.1

      (a)  (1) In the HUD Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, HUD pays rental subsidies so eligible families can afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The HCV program is generally administered by State or local governmental entities called public housing agencies (PHAs). HUD provides housing assistance funds to the PHA. HUD also provides funds for PHA administration of the program.

      (2) Families select and rent units that meet program housing quality standards. If the PHA approves a family's unit and tenancy, the PHA contracts with the owner to make rent subsidy payments on behalf of the family. A PHA may not approve a tenancy unless the rent is reasonable.

      (3) Subsidy in the HCV program is based on a local “payment standard” that reflects the cost to lease a unit in the local housing market. If the rent is less than the payment standard, the family generally pays 30 percent of adjusted monthly income for rent. If the rent is more than the payment standard, the family pays a larger share of the rent.

      (b)  (1) Section 8 assistance may be “tenant-based” or “project-based”. In project-based programs, rental assistance is paid for families who live in specific housing developments or units. With tenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family. The family may rent a unit anywhere in the United States in the jurisdiction of a PHA that runs a voucher program.

      (2) To receive tenant-based assistance, the family selects a suitable unit. After approving the tenancy, the PHA enters into a contract to make rental subsidy payments to the owner to subsidize occupancy by the family. The PHA contract with the owner only covers a single unit and a specific assisted family. If the family moves out of the leased unit, the contract with the owner terminates. The family may move to another unit with continued assistance so long as the family is complying with program requirements.

    Subpart C—Funding and PHA Application for Funding

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.101   Allocation of funding.

#### § § 982.101

      (a)  HUD allocates available budget authority for the tenant-based assistance program to HUD field offices.

      (b)  (1) Section 213(d) of the HCD Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1439) establishes requirements for allocation of assisted housing budget authority. Some budget authority is exempt by law from allocation under section 213(d). Unless exempted by law, budget authority for the tenant-based programs must be allocated in accordance with section 213(d).

      (2) Budget authority subject to allocation under section 213(d) is allocated in accordance with 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. There are three categories of section 213(d) funding allocations under part 791 of this title:

      (i) Funding retained in a headquarters reserve for purposes specified by law;

      (ii) funding incapable of geographic formula allocation (e.g., for renewal of expiring funding increments); or

      (iii) funding allocated by an objective fair share formula. Funding allocated by fair share formula is distributed by a competitive process.

      (c)  For budget authority that is distributed by competitive process, the Department solicits applications from PHAs by publishing one or more notices of funding availability (NOFAs) in the  See 24 CFR part 12, subpart B; and 24 CFR 791.406. The NOFA explains how to apply for assistance, and specifies the criteria for awarding the assistance. The NOFA may identify any special program requirements for use of the funding.

> [60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 26642, May 14, 1999; 80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015]

      § 982.102   Allocation of budget authority for renewal of expiring consolidated ACC funding increments.

#### § § 982.102

      (a)  This section applies to the renewal of consolidated ACC funding increments in the program (as described in § 982.151(a)(2)) that expire after December 31, 1999 (including any assistance that the PHA has attached to units for project-based assistance under 24 CFR part 983). This section implements section 8(dd) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(dd)).

      (b)  HUD will use the following methodology to determine the amount of budget authority to be allocated to a PHA for the renewal of expiring consolidated ACC funding increments in the program, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. If the amount of appropriated funds is not sufficient to provide the full amount of renewal funding for PHAs, as calculated in accordance with this section, HUD may establish a procedure to adjust allocations for the shortfall in funding.

      (c)  Subject to availability of appropriated funds, as determined by HUD, the amount of budget authority allocated by HUD to a PHA for renewal of each program funding increment that expires during a calendar year will be equal to:

      (1)  The number of renewal units assigned to the funding increment (as determined by HUD pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section); multiplied by

      (2)  The adjusted annual per unit cost (as determined by HUD pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section).

      (d) —(1)  HUD will determine the total number of renewal units for a PHA's program as of the last day of the calendar year previous to the calendar year for which renewal funding is calculated. The number of renewal units for a PHA's program will be determined as follows:

      (i)  HUD will establish a baseline number of units (“baseline”) for each PHA program. The initial baseline equals the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHA program as of December 31, 1999.

      (ii)  The adjusted baseline equals the initial baseline with the following adjustments from the initial baseline as of the last day of the calendar year previous to the calendar year for which renewal funding is calculated:

      (A)  HUD will add to the initial baseline any additional units reserved for the PHA after December 31, 1999.

      (B)  HUD will subtract from the initial baseline any units de-reserved by HUD from the PHA program after December 31, 1999.

      (iii)  The number of renewal units equals the adjusted baseline minus the number of units supported by contract funding increments that expire after the end of the calendar year.

      (2)  HUD will assign all units reserved for a PHA program to one or more funding increment(s).

      (3)  HUD may adjust the number of renewal units to correct errors.

      (e)  HUD will determine the PHA's adjusted per unit cost when HUD processes the allocation of renewal funding for an expiring contract funding increment. The adjusted per unit cost calculated will be determined as follows:

      (1) —(i)  HUD will determine the PHA's monthly per unit program expenditure for the HCV program (including project-based assistance under such program) under the consolidated ACC with HUD using data from the PHA's most recent HUD-approved year end statement.

      (ii)  The monthly program expenditure equals:

      (A)  The PHA's total program expenditure (the total of housing assistance payments and administrative costs) for the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement; divided by

      (B)  The total of unit months leased for the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement.

      (2)  HUD will determine the PHA's annual per unit cost. The annual per unit cost equals the monthly program expenditures (as determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section) multiplied by 12.

      (3)  (i) HUD will determine the PHA's adjusted annual per unit cost. The adjusted annual per unit cost equals the annual per unit cost (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) multiplied cumulatively by the applicable published Section 8 housing assistance payments program annual adjustment factors in effect during the period from the end of the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement to the time when HUD processes the allocation of renewal funding.

      (ii)  For this purpose, HUD will use the annual adjustment factor from the notice published annually in the  pursuant to part 888 that is applicable to the jurisdiction of the PHA. For a PHA whose jurisdiction spans multiple annual adjustment factor areas, HUD will use the highest applicable annual adjustment factor.

      (iii)  HUD will use the Annual Adjustment Factors in effect during the time period subsequent to the time covered by the most recent HUD approved Year End Statement and the time of the processing of the contract funding increment to be renewed.

      (iv)  At its discretion, HUD may modify the adjusted annual per unit cost based on receipt of a modification request from a PHA. The modification request must demonstrate that because of special circumstances application of the annual adjustment factor will not provide an accurate adjusted annual per unit cost.

      (4)  HUD may correct for errors in the adjusted per unit cost.

      (f)  HUD will reserve allocated renewal funding available to the PHA within a reasonable time prior to the expiration of the funding increment to be renewed and establish a new expiration date one-year from the date of such expiration.

      (g) —(1)  In the event that a PHA's costs incurred threaten to exceed budget authority and allowable reserves, HUD reserves the right, through  notice, to bring PHA program costs and the number of families served, in line with PHA program finances.

      (2)  HUD may, by  notice, limit the amount or percentage of increases in the adjusted annual per unit cost to be used in calculating the allocation of budget authority.

      (3)  HUD may, by  notice, limit the amount or percentage of decreases in the adjusted annual per unit cost to be used in calculating the allocation of budget authority.

      (4)  If HUD publishes a  notice pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section, it will describe the rationale, circumstances and procedures under which such modifications are implemented. Such circumstances and procedures shall, be consistent with the objective of enabling PHAs and HUD to meet program goals and requirements including but not limited to:

      (i) Deconcentration of poverty and expanding housing opportunities;

      (ii) Reasonable rent burden;

      (iii) Income targeting;

      (iv) Consistency with applicable consolidated plan(s);

      (v) Rent reasonableness;

      (vi) Program efficiency and economy;

      (vii) Service to additional households within budgetary limitations; and

      (viii) Service to the adjusted baseline number of families.

      (5)  HUD will design and undertake informal public consultation prior to issuing  notices pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section.

      (h)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, HUD may prorate the amount of budget authority allocated for the renewal of funding increments that expire on different dates throughout the calendar year. HUD may use such proration to synchronize the expiration dates of funding increments under the PHA's consolidated ACC.

      (i)  If a PHA has performance deficiencies, such as a failure to adequately lease units, HUD may reallocate some of its budget authority to other PHAs. If HUD determines to reallocate budget authority, it will reduce the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHA program of the PHA whose budget authority is being reallocated and increase the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHAs whose programs are receiving the benefit of the reallocation, so that such PHAs can issue vouchers. HUD will publish a notice in the  that will describe the circumstances and procedures for reallocating budget authority pursuant to this paragraph.

      § 982.103   PHA application for funding.

#### § § 982.103

      (a) A PHA must submit an application for program funding to HUD at the time and place and in the form required by HUD.

      (b) For competitive funding under a NOFA, the application must be submitted by a PHA in accordance with the requirements of the NOFA.

      (c) The application must include all information required by HUD. HUD requirements may be stated in the HUD-required form of application, the NOFA, or other HUD instructions.

#### § § 982.104

      (a)  For competitive funding under a NOFA, HUD must evaluate an application on the basis of the selection criteria stated in the NOFA, and must consider the PHA's capacity and capability to administer the program.

      (b)  (1) HUD must notify the PHA of its approval or disapproval of the PHA funding application.

      (2) When HUD approves an application, HUD must notify the PHA of the amount of approved funding.

      (3) For budget authority that is distributed to PHAs by competitive process, documentation of the basis for provision or denial of assistance is available for public inspection in accordance with 24 CFR 12.14(b).

      (c)  HUD will not approve any PHA funding application (including an application for competitive funding under a NOFA) if HUD determines that the PHA is disbarred or otherwise disqualified from providing assistance under the program.

    Subpart D—Annual Contributions Contract and PHA Administration of Program

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.151   Annual contributions contract.

#### § § 982.151

      (a)  (1) An annual contributions contract (ACC) is a written contract between HUD and a PHA. Under the ACC, HUD agrees to make payments to the PHA, over a specified term, for housing assistance payments to owners and for the PHA administrative fee. The ACC specifies the maximum payment over the ACC term. The PHA agrees to administer the program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.

      (2) HUD's commitment to make payments for each funding increment in the PHA program constitutes a separate ACC. However, commitments for all the funding increments in a PHA program are listed in one consolidated contractual document called the consolidated annual contributions contract (consolidated ACC). A single consolidated ACC covers funding for the PHA's HCV program.

      (b)  (1) Budget authority is the maximum amount that may be paid by HUD to a PHA over the ACC term of a funding increment. Before adding a funding increment to the consolidated ACC for a PHA program, HUD reserves budget authority from amounts authorized and appropriated by the Congress for the program.

      (2) For each funding increment, the ACC specifies the term over which HUD will make payments for the PHA program, and the amount of available budget authority for each funding increment. The amount to be paid to the PHA during each PHA fiscal year (including payment from the ACC reserve account described in § 982.154) must be approved by HUD.

      § 982.152   Administrative fee.

#### § § 982.152

      (a)  (1) HUD may approve administrative fees to the PHA for any of the following purposes:

      (i) Ongoing administrative fee;

      (ii) Costs to help families who experience difficulty finding or renting appropriate housing under the program;

      (iii) The following types of extraordinary costs approved by HUD:

      (A) Costs to cover necessary additional expenses incurred by the PHA to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title (e.g., additional counselling costs), where the PHA is unable to cover such additional expenses from ongoing administrative fee income or the PHA administrative fee reserve;

      (B) Costs of audit by an independent public accountant;

      (C) Other extraordinary costs determined necessary by HUD Headquarters;

      (iv) Preliminary fee (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section);

      (v) Costs to coordinate supportive services for families participating in the family self-sufficiency (FSS) program.

      (2) For each PHA fiscal year, administrative fees are specified in the PHA budget. The budget is submitted for HUD approval. Fees are paid in the amounts approved by HUD. Administrative fees may only be approved or paid from amounts appropriated by the Congress.

      (3) PHA administrative fees may only be used to cover costs incurred to perform PHA administrative responsibilities for the program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.

      (b)  (1) The PHA ongoing administrative fee is paid for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month. The amount of the ongoing fee is determined by HUD in accordance with Section 8(q)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)(1)).

      (2) If appropriations are available, HUD may pay a higher ongoing administrative fee for a small program or a program operating over a large geographic area. This higher fee level will not be approved unless the PHA demonstrates that it is efficiently administering its HCV program, and that the higher ongoing administrative fee is reasonable and necessary for administration of the program in accordance with HUD requirements.

      (3) HUD may pay a lower ongoing administrative fee for PHA-owned units.

      (c)  (1) If the PHA was not administering a program of Section 8 tenant-based assistance prior to the merger date, HUD will pay a one-time fee in the amount of $500 in the first year the PHA administers a program. The fee is paid for each new unit added to the PHA program by the initial funding increment under the consolidated ACC.

      (2) The preliminary fee is used to cover expenses the PHA incurs to help families who inquire about or apply for the program, and to lease up new program units.

      (d)  HUD may reduce or offset any administrative fee to the PHA, in the amount determined by HUD, if the PHA fails to perform PHA administrative responsibilities correctly or adequately under the program (for example, PHA failure to enforce HQS requirements; or to reimburse a receiving PHA promptly under portability procedures).

      (1) The amount by which program administrative fees paid by HUD for a PHA fiscal year exceed the PHA program administrative expenses for the fiscal year; plus

      (2) Interest earned on the administrative fee reserve.

      (b)(1) The PHA must use funds in the administrative fee reserve to pay program administrative expenses in excess of administrative fees paid by HUD for a PHA fiscal year. If funds in the administrative fee reserve are not needed to cover PHA administrative expenses (to the end of the last expiring funding increment under the consolidated ACC), the PHA may use these funds for other housing purposes permitted by State and local law. However, HUD may prohibit use of the funds for certain purposes.

      (2) The PHA Board of Commissioners or other authorized officials must establish the maximum amount that may be charged against the administrative fee reserve without specific approval.

      (3) If the PHA has not adequately administered any Section 8 program, HUD may prohibit use of funds in the administrative fee reserve, and may direct the PHA to use funds in the reserve to improve administration of the program or to reimburse ineligible expenses.

    Subpart E—Admission to Tenant-Based Program

      § 982.201   Eligibility and targeting.

#### § § 982.201

      (a)  The PHA may admit only eligible families to the program. To be eligible, an applicant must be a “family;” must be income-eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and 24 CFR part 5, subpart F; and must be a citizen or a noncitizen who has eligible immigration status as determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E. If the applicant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies.

      (b) —(1)  To be income-eligible, the applicant must be a family in any of the following categories:

      (i) A “very low income” family;

      (ii) A low-income family that is “continuously assisted” under the 1937 Housing Act;

      (iii) A low-income family that meets additional eligibility criteria specified in the PHA Administrative Plan. Such additional PHA criteria must be consistent with the PHA plan and with the consolidated plans for local governments in the PHA jurisdiction;

      (iv) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a HOPE 1 (HOPE for public housing homeownership) or HOPE 2 (HOPE for homeownership of multifamily units) project. (Section 8(o)(4)(D) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(4)(D));

      (v) A low-income or moderate-income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of an insurance contract on eligible low-income housing as defined in § 248.101 of this title;

      (vi) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a project subject to a resident homeownership program under § 248.173 of this title.

      (2)  (i) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's HCV program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low income families. Annual income of such families shall be verified within the period described in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (ii) A PHA may admit a lower percent of extremely low income families during a PHA fiscal year (than otherwise required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) if HUD approves the use of such lower percent by the PHA, in accordance with the PHA plan, based on HUD's determination that the following circumstances necessitate use of such lower percent by the PHA:

      (A) The PHA has opened its waiting list for a reasonable time for admission of extremely low income families residing in the same metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or non-metropolitan county, both inside and outside the PHA jurisdiction;

      (B) The PHA has provided full public notice of such opening to such families, and has conducted outreach and marketing to such families, including outreach and marketing to extremely low income families on the Section 8 and public housing waiting lists of other PHAs with jurisdiction in the same MSA or non-metropolitan county;

      (C) Notwithstanding such actions by the PHA (in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section), there are not enough extremely low income families on the PHA's waiting list to fill available slots in the program during any fiscal year for which use of a lower percent is approved by HUD; and

      (D) Admission of the additional very low income families other than extremely low income families to the PHA's tenant-based voucher program will substantially address worst case housing needs as determined by HUD.

      (iii) If approved by HUD, the admission of a portion of very low income welfare-to-work (WTW) families that are not extremely low income families may be disregarded in determining compliance with the PHA's income-targeting obligations under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. HUD will grant such approval only if and to the extent that the PHA has demonstrated to HUD's satisfaction that compliance with such targeting obligations with respect to such portion of WTW families would interfere with the objectives of the welfare-to-work voucher program. If HUD grants such approval, admission of that portion of WTW families is not counted in the base number of families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based voucher program during the fiscal year for purposes of income targeting.

      (iv) Admission of families as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(v) of this section is not subject to targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

      (v) If the jurisdictions of two or more PHAs that administer the HCV program cover an identical geographic area, such PHAs may elect to be treated as a single PHA for purposes of targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such a case, the PHAs shall cooperate to assure that aggregate admissions by such PHAs comply with the targeting requirement. If such PHAs do not have a single fiscal year, HUD will determine which PHA's fiscal year is used for this purpose.

      (vi) If a family initially leases a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures at admission to the HCV program, such admission shall be counted against the targeting obligation of the initial PHA (unless the receiving PHA absorbs the portable family into the receiving PHA's HCV program from the point of admission).

      (3) The annual income (gross income) of an applicant family is used both for determination of income-eligibility under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In determining annual income of an applicant family that includes a person with disabilities, the determination must include the disallowance of increase in annual income as provided in 24 CFR 5.617, if applicable.

      (4) The applicable income limit for issuance of a voucher when a family is selected for the program is the highest income limit (for the family size) for areas in the PHA jurisdiction. The applicable income limit for admission to the program is the income limit for the area where the family is initially assisted in the program. At admission, the family may only use the voucher to rent a unit in an area where the family is income eligible.

      (c)  See definition of “family” in 24 CFR 5.403.

      (d)  (1) An applicant is continuously assisted under the 1937 Housing Act if the family is already receiving assistance under any 1937 Housing Act program when the family is admitted to the voucher program.

      (2) The PHA must establish policies concerning whether and to what extent a brief interruption between assistance under one of these programs and admission to the voucher program will be considered to break continuity of assistance under the 1937 Housing Act.

      (e)  The PHA must receive information verifying that an applicant is eligible within the period of 60 days before the PHA issues a voucher to the applicant.

      (f) —(1)  The PHA must give an applicant prompt written notice of a decision denying admission to the program (including a decision that the applicant is not eligible, or denying assistance for other reasons). The notice must give a brief statement of the reasons for the decision. The notice must also state that the applicant may request an informal review of the decision, and state how to arrange for the informal review.

      (2) For description of the grounds for denying assistance because of action or inaction by the applicant, see § 982.552(b) and (c) (requirement and authority to deny admission) and § 982.553(a) (crime by family members).

      § 982.202   How applicants are selected: General requirements.

#### § § 982.202

      (a)  The PHA may admit an applicant for participation in the program either:

      (1) As a special admission (see § 982.203).

      (2) As a waiting list admission (see § 982.204 through § 982.210).

      (b) —(1)  Admission to the program may not be based on where the family lives before admission to the program. However, the PHA may target assistance for families who live in public housing or other federally assisted housing, or may adopt a residency preference (see § 982.207).

      (2)  Admission to the program may not be based on where the family will live with assistance under the program.

      (3)  The PHA preference system may provide a preference for admission of families with certain characteristics from the PHA waiting list. However, admission to the program may not be based on:

      (i) Discrimination because members of the family are unwed parents, recipients of public assistance, or children born out of wedlock;

      (ii) Discrimination because a family includes children (familial status discrimination);

      (iii) Discrimination because of age, race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;

      (iv) Discrimination because of disability; or

      (v) Whether a family decides to participate in a family self-sufficiency program.

      (c)  An applicant does not have any right or entitlement to be listed on the PHA waiting list, to any particular position on the waiting list, or to admission to the programs. The preceding sentence does not affect or prejudice any right, independent of this rule, to bring a judicial action challenging an PHA violation of a constitutional or statutory requirement.

      (d)  The PHA must admit applicants for participation in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements, including, but not limited to, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and with PHA policies stated in the PHA Administrative Plan and the PHA plan. The PHA admission policy must state the system of admission preferences that the PHA uses to select applicants from the waiting list, including any residency preference or other local preference.

      § 982.203   Special admission (non-waiting list): Assistance targeted by HUD.

#### § § 982.203

      (a) If HUD awards a PHA program funding that is targeted for families living in specified units:

      (1) The PHA must use the assistance for the families living in these units.

      (2) The PHA may admit a family that is not on the PHA waiting list, or without considering the family's waiting list position. The PHA must maintain records showing that the family was admitted with HUD-targeted assistance.

      (b) The following are examples of types of program funding that may be targeted for a family living in a specified unit:

      (1) A family displaced because of demolition or disposition of a public housing project;

      (2) A family residing in a multifamily rental housing project when HUD sells, forecloses or demolishes the project;

      (3) For housing covered by the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (41 U.S.C. 4101 ):

      (i) A non-purchasing family residing in a project subject to a homeownership program (under 24 CFR 248.173); or

      (ii) A family displaced because of mortgage prepayment or voluntary termination of a mortgage insurance contract (as provided in 24 CFR 248.165);

      (4) A family residing in a project covered by a project-based Section 8 HAP contract at or near the end of the HAP contract term; and

      (5) A non-purchasing family residing in a HOPE 1 or HOPE 2 project.

      § 982.204   Waiting list: Administration of waiting list.

#### § § 982.204

      (a)  Except for special admissions, participants must be selected from the PHA waiting list. The PHA must select participants from the waiting list in accordance with admission policies in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (b)  The PHA must maintain information that permits the PHA to select participants from the waiting list in accordance with the PHA admission policies. The waiting list must contain the following information for each applicant listed:

      (1) Applicant name;

      (2) Family unit size (number of bedrooms for which family qualifies under PHA occupancy standards);

      (3) Date and time of application;

      (4) Qualification for any local preference;

      (5) Racial or ethnic designation of the head of household.

      (c)  (1) The PHA Administrative Plan must state PHA policy on when applicant names may be removed from the waiting list. The policy may provide that the PHA will remove names of applicants who do not respond to PHA requests for information or updates.

      (2) An PHA decision to withdraw from the waiting list the name of an applicant family that includes a person with disabilities is subject to reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. If the applicant did not respond to the PHA request for information or updates because of the family member's disability, the PHA must reinstate the applicant in the family's former position on the waiting list.

      (d)  (1) The order of admission from the waiting list may not be based on family size, or on the family unit size for which the family qualifies under the PHA occupancy policy.

      (2) If the PHA does not have sufficient funds to subsidize the family unit size of the family at the top of the waiting list, the PHA may not skip the top family to admit an applicant with a smaller family unit size. Instead, the family at the top of the waiting list will be admitted when sufficient funds are available.

      (e)  When HUD awards an PHA program funding for a specified category of families on the waiting list, the PHA must select applicant families in the specified category.

      (f)  A PHA must use a single waiting list for admission to its Section 8 tenant-based assistance program. However, the PHA may use a separate single waiting list for such admissions for a county or municipality.

> [59 FR 36682, July 18, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 34717, July 3, 1995; 63 FR 23860, Apr. 30, 1998; 64 FR 26643, May 14, 1999; 65 FR 16821, Mar. 30, 2000]

      § 982.205   Waiting list: Different programs.

#### § § 982.205

      (a) —(1)  A PHA may merge the waiting list for tenant-based assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program, including a federal or local program. In admission from the merged waiting list, admission for each federal program is subject to federal regulations and requirements for the particular program.

      (2)  If the PHA decides not to merge the waiting list for tenant-based assistance with the waiting list for the PHA's public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program:

      (i) If the PHA's waiting list for tenant-based assistance is open when an applicant is placed on the waiting list for the PHA's public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program, the PHA must offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for tenant-based assistance.

      (ii) If the PHA's waiting list for its public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program is open when an applicant is placed on the waiting list for its tenant-based program, and if the other program includes units suitable for the applicant, the PHA must offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for the other program.

      (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, “other housing subsidy” means a housing subsidy other than assistance under the voucher program. Housing subsidy includes subsidy assistance under a federal housing program (including public housing), a State housing program, or a local housing program.

      (2) The PHA may not take any of the following actions because an applicant has applied for, received, or refused other housing assistance:

      (i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance;

      (ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified;

      (iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date and time of application, or other factors affecting selection under the PHA selection policy; or

      (iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list.

> [59 FR 36682, July 18, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 27163, May 30, 1996; 63 FR 23860, Apr. 30, 1998; 64 FR 26643, May 14, 1999; 65 FR 16821, Mar. 30, 2000; 80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015]

      § 982.206   Waiting list: Opening and closing; public notice.

#### § § 982.206

      (a)  (1) When the PHA opens a waiting list, the PHA must give public notice that families may apply for tenant-based assistance. The public notice must state where and when to apply.

      (2) The PHA must give the public notice by publication in a local newspaper of general circulation, and also by minority media and other suitable means. The notice must comply with HUD fair housing requirements.

      (3) The public notice must state any limitations on who may apply for available slots in the program.

      (b)  (1) The PHA may adopt criteria defining what families may apply for assistance under a public notice.

      (2) If the waiting list is open, the PHA must accept applications from families for whom the list is open unless there is good cause for not accepting the application (such as denial of assistance because of action or inaction by members of the family) for the grounds stated in §§ 982.552 and 982.553.

      (c)  If the PHA determines that the existing waiting list contains an adequate pool for use of available program funding, the PHA may stop accepting new applications, or may accept only applications meeting criteria adopted by the PHA.

> [59 FR 36682, July 18, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 34717, July 3, 1995; 60 FR 45661, Sept. 1, 1995; 63 FR 23860, Apr. 30, 1998; 64 FR 26643, May 14, 1999]

      § 982.207   Waiting list: Local preferences in admission to program.

#### § § 982.207

      (a)  (1) The PHA may establish a system of local preferences for selection of families admitted to the program. PHA selection preferences must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (2) The PHA system of local preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities, as determined by the PHA. In determining such needs and priorities, the PHA shall use generally accepted data sources. The PHA shall consider public comment on the proposed public housing agency plan (as received pursuant to § 903.17 of this chapter) and on the consolidated plan for the relevant jurisdiction (as received pursuant to part 91 of this title).

      (3) The PHA may limit the number of applicants that may qualify for any local preference.

      (4) The PHA shall not deny a local preference, nor otherwise exclude or penalize a family in admission to the program, solely because the family resides in a public housing project. The PHA may establish a preference for families residing in public housing who are victims of a crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16).

      (b) —(1)  (i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although a PHA is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the PHA may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title.

      (ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”). A county or municipality may be used as a residency preference area. An area smaller than a county or municipality may not be used as a residency preference area.

      (iii) Any PHA residency preferences must be included in the statement of PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admission to the program, which is included in the PHA annual plan (or supporting documents) pursuant to part 903 of this title. Such policies must specify that use of a residency preference will not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to the program based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.

      (iv) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.

      (v) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The PHA may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.

      (2)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families where the head, spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.

      (3)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the PHA may not adopt a preference for admission of persons with a specific disability.

      (4)  The PHA should consider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

      (5)  The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.

      (c)  The PHA system of preferences may use either of the following to select among applicants on the waiting list with the same preference status:

      (1) Date and time of application; or

      (2) A drawing or other random choice technique.

      (d)  The PHA must not select families for admission to the program in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting higher income families for admission to the program.

      (e)  The method for selecting applicants from a preference category must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that each applicant has been selected in accordance with the method specified in the Administrative Plan.

      (2) If the family needs and requests an extension of the initial voucher term as a reasonable accommodation, in accordance with part 8 of this title, to make the program accessible to a family member who is a person with disabilities, the PHA must extend the voucher term up to the term reasonably required for that purpose.

      (c)  The PHA must provide for suspension of the initial or any extended term of the voucher from the date that the family submits a request for PHA approval of the tenancy until the date the PHA notifies the family in writing whether the request has been approved or denied.

      § 982.304   Illegal discrimination: PHA assistance to family.

#### § § 982.304

      A family may claim that illegal discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status or disability prevents the family from finding or leasing a suitable unit with assistance under the program.

      § 982.305   PHA approval of assisted tenancy.

#### § § 982.305

      (a)  The PHA may not give approval for the family of the assisted tenancy, or execute a HAP contract, until the PHA has determined that:

      (1) The unit is eligible;

      (2) The unit has been inspected by the PHA and passes HQS;

      (3) The lease includes the tenancy addendum;

      (4) The rent to owner is reasonable; and

      (5) At the time a family initially receives tenant-based assistance for occupancy of a dwelling unit, and where the gross rent of the unit exceeds the applicable payment standard for the family, the family share does not exceed 40 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.

      (b)  (1) The following must be completed before the beginning of the initial term of the lease for a unit:

      (i) The PHA has inspected the unit and has determined that the unit satisfies the HQS;

      (ii) The landlord and the tenant have executed the lease (including the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum, and the lead-based paint disclosure information as required in § 35.92(b) of this title); and

      (iii) The PHA has approved leasing of the unit in accordance with program requirements.

      (2)  (i) The PHA must inspect the unit, determine whether the unit satisfies the HQS, and notify the family and owner of the determination:

      (A) In the case of a PHA with up to 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.

      (B) In the case of a PHA with more than 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within a reasonable time after the family submits a request for approval of the tenancy. To the extent practicable, such inspection and determination must be completed within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.

      (ii) The 15-day clock (under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) is suspended during any period when the unit is not available for inspection.

      (3) If the PHA has implemented, and the unit is covered by, the alternative inspection option for initial inspections under § 982.406(e), the PHA is not subject to paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1)(i), and (b)(2) of this section.

      (4) In the case of a unit subject to a lease-purchase agreement, the PHA must provide written notice to the family of the environmental requirements that must be met before commencing homeownership assistance for the family (see § 982.626(c)).

      (2) The PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner until the HAP contract has been executed.

      (3) If the HAP contract is executed during the period of 60 calendar days from the beginning of the lease term, the PHA will pay housing assistance payments after execution of the HAP contract (in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract), to cover the portion of the lease term before execution of the HAP contract (a maximum of 60 days).

      (4) Any HAP contract executed after the 60-day period is void, and the PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner, unless there are extenuating circumstances that prevent or prevented the PHA from meeting the 60-day deadline, then the PHA may submit to the HUD field office a request for an extension. The request, which must be submitted no later than two weeks after the 60-day deadline, must include an explanation of the extenuating circumstances and any supporting documentation. HUD at its sole discretion will determine if the extension request is approved.

      (d)  After receiving the family's request for approval of the assisted tenancy, the PHA must promptly notify the family and owner whether the assisted tenancy is approved.

      (e)  If the PHA has given approval for the family of the assisted tenancy, the owner and the PHA execute the HAP contract.

      (f)  (1) Unless the PHA has implemented, and determined that the unit is covered by, either of the two initial HQS inspection options in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the unit must be inspected by the PHA and pass HQS before:

      (i) The PHA may approve the assisted tenancy and execute the HAP contract, and

      (ii) The beginning of the initial lease term.

      (i) The PHA may approve the assisted tenancy and execute the HAP contract; and

      (ii) The beginning of the initial lease term.

      (4) If the PHA has implemented and determines that the unit is covered by both the no life-threatening deficiencies option and the alternative inspection option, the unit is subject only to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, not paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

      § 982.306   PHA disapproval of owner.

#### § § 982.306

      (a) The PHA must not approve an assisted tenancy if the PHA has been informed (by HUD or otherwise) that the owner is debarred, suspended, or subject to a limited denial of participation under 2 CFR part 2424.

      (b) When directed by HUD, the PHA must not approve an assisted tenancy if:

      (1) The federal government has instituted an administrative or judicial action against the owner for violation of the Fair Housing Act or other federal equal opportunity requirements, and such action is pending; or

      (2) A court or administrative agency has determined that the owner violated the Fair Housing Act or other federal equal opportunity requirements.

      (c) In its administrative discretion, the PHA may deny approval of an assisted tenancy for any of the following reasons:

      (1) The owner has violated obligations under a HAP contract under Section 8 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f);

      (2) The owner has committed fraud, bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any federal housing program;

      (3) The owner has engaged in any drug-related criminal activity or any violent criminal activity;

      (4) The owner has a history or practice of non-compliance with the HQS for units leased under the tenant-based programs, or with applicable housing standards for units leased with project-based Section 8 assistance or leased under any other federal housing program;

      (5) The owner has a history or practice of failing to terminate tenancy of tenants of units assisted under Section 8 or any other federally assisted housing program for activity engaged in by the tenant, any member of the household, a guest or another person under the control of any member of the household that:

      (i) Threatens the right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents;

      (ii) Threatens the health or safety of other residents, of employees of the PHA, or of owner employees or other persons engaged in management of the housing;

      (iii) Threatens the health or safety of, or the right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences, by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or

      (7) The owner has not paid State or local real estate taxes, fines or assessments.

      (d) The PHA must not approve a unit if the owner is the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of the family, unless the PHA determines that approving the unit would provide reasonable accommodation for a family member who is a person with disabilities. This restriction against PHA approval of a unit only applies at the time a family initially receives tenant-based assistance for occupancy of a particular unit, but does not apply to PHA approval of a new tenancy with continued tenant-based assistance in the same unit.

      (e) Nothing in this rule is intended to give any owner any right to participate in the program.

      (f) For purposes of this section, “owner” includes a principal or other interested party.

      § 982.307   Tenant screening.

#### § § 982.307

      (a)  (1) The PHA has no liability or responsibility to the owner or other persons for the family's behavior or suitability for tenancy. However, the PHA may opt to screen applicants for family behavior or suitability for tenancy. The PHA must conduct any such screening of applicants in accordance with policies stated in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (2) The owner is responsible for screening and selection of the family to occupy the owner's unit. At or before PHA approval of the tenancy, the PHA must inform the owner that screening and selection for tenancy is the responsibility of the owner.

      (3) The owner is responsible for screening of families on the basis of their tenancy histories. An owner may consider a family's background with respect to such factors as:

      (i) Payment of rent and utility bills;

      (ii) Caring for a unit and premises;

      (iii) Respecting the rights of other residents to the peaceful enjoyment of their housing;

      (iv) Drug-related criminal activity or other criminal activity that is a threat to the health, safety or property of others; and

      (v) Compliance with other essential conditions of tenancy.

      (i) The family's current and prior address (as shown in the PHA records); and

      (ii) The name and address (if known to the PHA) of the landlord at the family's current and prior address.

      (2) When a family wants to lease a dwelling unit, the PHA may offer the owner other information in the PHA possession, about the family, including information about the tenancy history of family members, or about drug-trafficking by family members.

      (3) The PHA must give the family a statement of the PHA policy on providing information to owners. The statement must be included in the information packet that is given to a family selected to participate in the program. The PHA policy must provide that the PHA will give the same types of information to all families and to all owners.

      (4) In cases involving a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies.

      § 982.308   Lease and tenancy.

#### § § 982.308

      (a)  The tenant must have legal capacity to enter a lease under State and local law. “Legal capacity” means that the tenant is bound by the terms of the lease and may enforce the terms of the lease against the owner.

      (b)  (1) The tenant and the owner must enter a written lease for the unit. The lease must be executed by the owner and the tenant.

      (2) If the owner uses a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants in the locality or the premises, the lease must be in such standard form (plus the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum). If the owner does not use a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants, the owner may use another form of lease, such as a PHA model lease (including the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum). The HAP contract prescribed by HUD will contain the owner's certification that if the owner uses a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants, the lease is in such standard form.

      (c)  The PHA may review the lease to determine if the lease complies with _State and local law._ The PHA may decline to approve the tenancy if the PHA determines that the lease does not comply with State or local law.

      (d)  The lease must specify all of the following:

      (1) The names of the owner and the tenant;

      (2) The unit rented (address, apartment number, and any other information needed to identify the contract unit);

      (3) The term of the lease (initial term and any provisions for renewal);

      (4) The amount of the monthly rent to owner; and

      (5) A specification of what utilities and appliances are to be supplied by the owner, and what utilities and appliances are to be supplied by the family.

      (e)  The rent to owner must be reasonable (see § 982.507).

      (f)  (1) The HAP contract form required by HUD shall include an addendum (the “tenancy addendum”), that sets forth:

      (i) The tenancy requirements for the program (in accordance with this section and §§ 982.309 and 982.310); and

      (ii) The composition of the household as approved by the PHA (family members and any PHA-approved live-in aide).

      (2) All provisions in the HUD-required tenancy addendum must be added word-for-word to the owner's standard form lease that is used by the owner for unassisted tenants. The tenant shall have the right to enforce the tenancy addendum against the owner, and the terms of the tenancy addendum shall prevail over any other provisions of the lease.

      (g)  (1) If the tenant and the owner agree to any changes in the lease, such changes must be in writing, and the owner must immediately give the PHA a copy of such changes. The lease, including any changes, must be in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      (2) In the following cases, tenant-based assistance shall not be continued unless the PHA has approved a new tenancy in accordance with program requirements and has executed a new HAP contract with the owner:

      (i) If there are any changes in lease requirements governing tenant or owner responsibilities for utilities or appliances;

      (ii) If there are any changes in lease provisions governing the term of the lease;

      (iii) If the family moves to a new unit, even if the unit is in the same building or complex.

      (3) PHA approval of the tenancy, and execution of a new HAP contract, are not required for changes in the lease other than as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

      (4) The owner must notify the PHA of any changes in the amount of the rent to owner at least sixty days before any such changes go into effect, and any such changes shall be subject to rent reasonableness requirements (see § 982.503).

      § 982.309   Term of assisted tenancy.

#### § § 982.309

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the initial lease term must be for at least one year.

      (2) The PHA may approve a shorter initial lease term if the PHA determines that:

      (i) Such shorter term would improve housing opportunities for the tenant; and

      (ii) Such shorter term is the prevailing local market practice.

      (3) During the initial term of the lease, the owner may not raise the rent to owner.

      (4) The PHA may execute the HAP contract even if there is less than one year remaining from the beginning of the initial lease term to the end of the last expiring funding increment under the consolidated ACC.

      (b)  (1) The term of the HAP contract begins on the first day of the lease term and ends on the last day of the lease term.

      (2) The HAP contract terminates if any of the following occurs:

      (i) The lease is terminated by the owner or the tenant;

      (ii) The PHA terminates the HAP contract; or

      (iii) The PHA terminates assistance for the family.

      (c)  (1) If the family terminates the lease on notice to the owner, the family must give the PHA a copy of the notice of termination at the same time. Failure to do this is a breach of family obligations under the program.

      (2) The family must notify the PHA and the owner before the family moves out of the unit. Failure to do this is a breach of family obligations under the program.

      § 982.310   Owner termination of tenancy.

#### § § 982.310

      (a)  During the term of the lease, the owner may not terminate the tenancy except on the following grounds:

      (1) Serious violation (including but not limited to failure to pay rent or other amounts due under the lease) or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease;

      (2) Violation of federal, State, or local law that imposes obligations on the tenant in connection with the occupancy or use of the premises; or

      (3) Other good cause.

      (b)  (1) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the PHA.

      (2) The PHA failure to pay the housing assistance payment to the owner is not a violation of the lease between the tenant and the owner. During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.

      (c) —(1)  The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in, on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, or such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the owner to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that the owner may evict a family when the owner determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the owner determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (2)  (i)  The lease must provide that the owner may terminate tenancy for any of the following types of criminal activity by a covered person:

      (A) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents (including property management staff residing on the premises);

      (B) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or

      (C) Any violent criminal activity on or near the premises by a tenant, household member, or guest, or any such activity on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control.

      (ii)  The lease must provide that the owner may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is:

      (A) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or

      (B) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.

      (3)  The owner may terminate tenancy and evict by judicial action a family for criminal activity by a covered person in accordance with this section if the owner determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction. (See part 5, subpart J, of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)

      (d)  (1) “Other good cause” for termination of tenancy by the owner may include, but is not limited to, any of the following examples:

      (i) Failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision;

      (ii) A family history of disturbance of neighbors or destruction of property, or of living or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the unit or premises;

      (iii) The owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or

      (iv) A business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental).

      (2) During the initial lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause”, unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do. For example, during this period, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause” based on any of the following grounds: failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision; the owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section).

      (e) —(1)  (i) The owner must give the tenant a written notice that specifies the grounds for termination of tenancy during the term of the lease. The tenancy does not terminate before the owner has given this notice, and the notice must be given at or before commencement of the eviction action.

      (ii) The notice of grounds may be included in, or may be combined with, any owner eviction notice to the tenant.

      (2)  (i) Owner eviction notice means a notice to vacate, or a complaint or other initial pleading used under State or local law to commence an eviction action.

      (ii) The owner must give the PHA a copy of any owner eviction notice to the tenant.

      (f)  The owner may only evict the tenant from the unit by instituting a court action.

      (g)  24 CFR part 247 (concerning evictions from certain subsidized and HUD-owned projects) does not apply to a tenancy assisted under this part 982.

      (h) —(1)  If the law and regulation permit the owner to take an action but do not require action to be taken, the owner may take or not take the action in accordance with the owner's standards for eviction. The owner may consider all of the circumstances relevant to a particular eviction case, such as:

      (i) The seriousness of the offending action;

      (ii) The effect on the community of denial or termination or the failure of the owner to take such action;

      (iii) The extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action;

      (iv) The effect of denial of admission or termination of tenancy on household members not involved in the offending activity;

      (v) The demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities;

      (vi) The extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action;

      (vii) The effect of the owner's action on the integrity of the program.

      (2)  The owner may require a tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.

      (3)  In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the owner may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the owner may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.

      (4)  The owner's termination of tenancy actions must be consistent with the fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of 24 CFR 5.105, and with the provisions for protection of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).

      § 982.311   When assistance is paid.

#### § § 982.311

      (a)  Housing assistance payments are paid to the owner in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract. Housing assistance payments may only be paid to the owner during the lease term, and while the family is residing in the unit.

      (b)  Housing assistance payments terminate when the lease is terminated by the owner in accordance with the lease. However, if the owner has commenced the process to evict the tenant, and if the family continues to reside in the unit, the PHA must continue to make housing assistance payments to the owner in accordance with the HAP contract until the owner has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant. The PHA may continue such payments until the family moves from or is evicted from the unit.

      (c)  Housing assistance payments terminate if:

      (1) The lease terminates;

      (2) The HAP contract terminates; or

      (3) The PHA terminates assistance for the family.

      (d)  (1) If the family moves out of the unit, the PHA may not make any housing assistance payment to the owner for any month after the month when the family moves out. The owner may keep the housing assistance payment for the month when the family moves out of the unit.

      (2) If a participant family moves from an assisted unit with continued tenant-based assistance, the term of the assisted lease for the new assisted unit may begin during the month the family moves out of the first assisted unit. Overlap of the last housing assistance payment (for the month when the family moves out of the old unit) and the first assistance payment for the new unit, is not considered to constitute a duplicative housing subsidy.

      § 982.312   Absence from unit.

#### § § 982.312

      (a) The family may be absent from the unit for brief periods. For longer absences, the PHA Administrative Plan establishes the PHA policy on how long the family may be absent from the assisted unit. However, the family may not be absent from the unit for a period of more than 180 consecutive calendar days in any circumstance, or for any reason. At its discretion, the PHA may allow absence for a lesser period in accordance with PHA policy.

      (b) Housing assistance payments terminate if the family is absent for longer than the maximum period permitted. The term of the HAP contract and assisted lease also terminate.

      (The owner must reimburse the PHA for any housing assistance payment for the period after the termination.)

      (c) Absence means that no member of the family is residing in the unit.

      (d)(1) The family must supply any information or certification requested by the PHA to verify that the family is residing in the unit, or relating to family absence from the unit. The family must cooperate with the PHA for this purpose. The family must promptly notify the PHA of absence from the unit, including any information requested on the purposes of family absences.

      (2) The PHA may adopt appropriate techniques to verify family occupancy or absence, including letters to the family at the unit, phone calls, visits or questions to the landlord or neighbors.

      (e) The PHA Administrative Plan must state the PHA policies on family absence from the dwelling unit. The PHA absence policy includes:

      (1) How the PHA determines whether or when the family may be absent, and for how long. For example, the PHA may establish policies on absences because of vacation, hospitalization or imprisonment; and

      (2) Any provision for resumption of assistance after an absence, including readmission or resumption of assistance to the family.

      § 982.313   Security deposit: Amounts owed by tenant.

#### § § 982.313

      (a) The owner may collect a security deposit from the tenant.

      (b) The PHA may prohibit security deposits in excess of private market practice, or in excess of amounts charged by the owner to unassisted tenants.

      (c) When the tenant moves out of the dwelling unit, the owner, subject to State or local law, may use the security deposit, including any interest on the deposit, in accordance with the lease, as reimbursement for any unpaid rent payable by the tenant, damages to the unit or for other amounts the tenant owes under the lease.

      (d) The owner must give the tenant a written list of all items charged against the security deposit, and the amount of each item. After deducting the amount, if any, used to reimburse the owner, the owner must refund promptly the full amount of the unused balance to the tenant.

      (e) If the security deposit is not sufficient to cover amounts the tenant owes under the lease, the owner may seek to collect the balance from the tenant.

      § 982.315   Family break-up.

#### § § 982.315

      (a)(1) The PHA has discretion to determine which members of an assisted family continue to receive assistance in the program if the family breaks up. The PHA Administrative Plan must state PHA policies on how to decide who remains in the program if the family breaks up.

      (2) If the family break-up results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance.

      (b) The factors to be considered in making this decision under the PHA policy may include:

      (1) Whether the assistance should remain with family members remaining in the original assisted unit.

      (2) The interest of minor children or of ill, elderly, or disabled family members.

      (3) Whether family members are forced to leave the unit as a result of actual or threatened domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

      (4) Whether any of the family members are receiving protection as victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and whether the abuser is still in the household.

      (5) Other factors specified by the PHA.

      (c) If a court determines the disposition of property between members of the assisted family in a divorce or separation under a settlement or judicial decree, the PHA is bound by the court's determination of which family members continue to receive assistance in the program.

      § 982.316   Live-in aide.

#### § § 982.316

      (a) A family that consists of one or more elderly, near-elderly or disabled persons may request that the PHA approve a live-in aide to reside in the unit and provide necessary supportive services for a family member who is a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 to make the program accessible to and usable by the family member with a disability. (See § 982.402(b)(6) concerning effect of live-in aide on family unit size.)

      (b) At any time, the PHA may refuse to approve a particular person as a live-in aide, or may withdraw such approval, if:

      (1) The person commits fraud, bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any federal housing program;

      (2) The person commits drug-related criminal activity or violent criminal activity; or

      (3) The person currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.

      § 982.317   Lease-purchase agreements.

#### § § 982.317

      (a) A family leasing a unit with assistance under the program may enter into an agreement with an owner to purchase the unit. So long as the family is receiving such rental assistance, all requirements applicable to families otherwise leasing units under the tenant-based program apply. Any homeownership premium (e.g., increment of value attributable to the value of the lease-purchase right or agreement such as an extra monthly payment to accumulate a downpayment or reduce the purchase price) included in the rent to the owner that would result in a higher subsidy amount than would otherwise be paid by the PHA must be absorbed by the family.

      (b) In determining whether the rent to owner for a unit subject to a lease-purchase agreement is a reasonable amount in accordance with § 982.503, any homeownership premium paid by the family to the owner must be excluded when the PHA determines rent reasonableness.

    Subpart H—Where Family Can Live and Move

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.351   Overview.

#### § § 982.351

      This subpart describes what kind of housing is eligible for leasing, and the areas where a family can live with tenant-based assistance. The subpart covers:

      (a) Assistance for a family that rents a dwelling unit in the jurisdiction of the PHA that originally selected the family for tenant-based assistance.

      (b) “Portability” assistance for a family PHA rents a unit outside the jurisdiction of the initial PHA.

      § 982.352   Eligible housing.

#### § § 982.352

      (a)  The following types of housing may not be assisted by a PHA in the tenant-based programs:

      (6) A unit occupied by its owner or by a person with any interest in the unit.

      (7) For provisions on PHA disapproval of an owner, see § 982.306.

      (b)  (1) PHA-owned units, as defined in § 982.4, may be assisted under the tenant-based program only if all the following conditions are satisfied:

      (i) The PHA must inform the family, both orally and in writing, that the family has the right to select any eligible unit available for lease.

      (ii) A PHA-owned unit is freely selected by the family, without PHA pressure or steering.

      (iii) The unit selected by the family is not ineligible housing.

      (iv) During assisted occupancy, the family may not benefit from any form of housing subsidy that is prohibited under paragraph (c) of this section.

      (v)(A) The PHA must obtain the services of an independent entity, as defined in § 982.4, to perform the following PHA functions as required under the program rule:

      () To determine rent reasonableness in accordance with § 982.507. The independent entity shall communicate the rent reasonableness determination to the family and the PHA.

      () To assist the family in negotiating the rent to owner in accordance with § 98_2_.506.

      () To inspect the unit for compliance with HQS in accordance with §§ 982._3_05(a) and 982.405. The independent entity shall communicate the results of each such inspection to the family and the PHA.

      (B) The PHA may compensate the independent entity from PHA administrative fees (including fees credited to the administrative fee reserve) for the services performed by the independent entity. The PHA may not use other program receipts to compensate the independent entity for such services. The PHA and the independent entity may not charge the family any fee or charge for the services provided by the independent entity.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (c)  A family may not receive the benefit of tenant-based assistance while receiving the benefit of any of the following forms of other housing subsidy, for the same unit or for a different unit:

      (1) Public or Indian housing assistance;

      (2) Other Section 8 assistance (including other tenant-based assistance);

      (3) Assistance under former Section 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (before amendment by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974);

      (4) Section 101 rent supplements;

      § 982.353   Where family can lease a unit with tenant-based assistance.

#### § § 982.353

      (a)  The family may receive tenant-based assistance to lease a unit located anywhere in the jurisdiction (as determined by State and local law) of the initial PHA. HUD may nevertheless restrict the family's right to lease such a unit anywhere in such jurisdiction if HUD determines that limitations on a family's opportunity to select among available units in that jurisdiction are appropriate to achieve desegregation goals in accordance with obligations generated by a court order or consent decree.

      (b)  Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, and to § 982.552 and § 982.553, a voucher-holder or participant family has the right to receive tenant-based voucher assistance, in accordance with requirements of this part, to lease a unit outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, anywhere in the United States, in the jurisdiction of a PHA with a tenant-based program under this part. The initial PHA must not provide such portable assistance for a participant if the family has moved out of the assisted unit in violation of the lease except as provided for in this subsection. If the family moves out in violation of the lease in order to protect the health or safety of a person who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believes him- or herself to be threatened with imminent harm from further violence by remaining in the dwelling unit (or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move), and has otherwise complied with all other obligations under the Section 8 program, the family may receive a voucher from the initial PHA and move to another jurisdiction under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

      (c)  (1) This paragraph (c) applies if neither the household head nor spouse of an assisted family already had a “domicile” (legal residence) in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA at the time when the family first submitted an application for participation in the program to the initial PHA.

      (2) The following apply during the 12 month period from the time when a family described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is admitted to the program:

      (i) The family may lease a unit anywhere in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA;

      (ii) The family does not have any right to portability;

      (iii) The initial PHA may choose to allow portability during this period.

      (3) If the initial PHA approves, the family may lease a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures.

      (4) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member who has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.

      (d)  (1) For admission to the program, a family must be income eligible in the area where the family initially leases a unit with assistance under the program.

      (2) If a family is a participant in the initial PHA's voucher program, income eligibility is not redetermined when the family moves to the receiving PHA program under portability procedures.

      (e)  The PHA may not directly or indirectly reduce the family's opportunity to select among available units, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, or elsewhere in this part 982 (e.g., prohibition on the use of ineligible housing, housing not meeting HQS, or housing for which the rent to owner exceeds a reasonable rent). However, the PHA must provide families the information required in § 982.301 for both the oral briefing and the information packet to ensure that they have the information they need to make an informed decision on their housing choice.

      § 982.354   Move with continued tenant-based assistance.

#### § § 982.354

      (a)  This section states when a participant family may move to a new unit with continued tenant-based assistance:

      (b)  A family may move to a new unit if:

      (1) The assisted lease for the old unit has terminated. This includes a termination because:

      (i) The PHA has terminated the HAP contract for the owner's breach; or

      (ii) The lease has terminated by mutual agreement of the owner and the tenant.

      (2) The owner has given the tenant a notice to vacate, or has commenced an action to evict the tenant, or has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant.

      (3) The tenant has given notice of lease termination (if the tenant has a right to terminate the lease on notice to the owner, for owner breach, or otherwise).

      (4) The family or a member of the family, is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or if any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move. A PHA may not terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, moves out of a unit in violation of the lease, if such move occurs to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit. However, any family member that has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move is not required to believe that he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit.

      (c)  (1) A participant family may move with continued assistance under the program, either inside the PHA jurisdiction, or under the portability procedures (See § 982.353) in accordance with the PHA's policies.

      (2) Consistent with applicable civil rights laws and regulations, the PHA may establish policies that:

      (i) Prohibit any move by the family during the initial lease term;

      (ii) Prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period; and

      (iii) The above policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.

      (d)  If the family wants to move to a new unit, the family must notify the PHA and the owner before moving from the old unit. If the family wants to move to a new unit that is located outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the notice to the initial PHA must specify the area where the family wants to move. See portability procedures in subpart H of this part.

      (e)  (1) The PHA may deny permission to move if the PHA does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance. The PHA must provide written notification to the local HUD Office within 10 business days of determining it is necessary to deny moves to a higher-cost unit based on insufficient funding.

      (2) At any time, the PHA may deny permission to move in accordance with § 982.552 (grounds for denial or termination of assistance).

      § 982.355   Portability: Administration by initial and receiving PHA.

#### § § 982.355

      (a)  When a family moves under portability (in accordance with § 982.353(b)) to an area outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the receiving PHA must administer assistance for the family if a PHA with a HCV program has jurisdiction in the area where the unit is located.

      (b)  A receiving PHA cannot refuse to assist incoming portable families or direct them to another neighboring PHA for assistance. If there is more than one such PHA, the initial PHA provides the family with the contact information for the receiving PHAs that serve the area, and the family selects the receiving PHA. The family must inform the initial PHA which PHA it has selected as the receiving PHA. In cases where the family prefers not to select the receiving PHA, the initial PHA selects the receiving PHA on behalf of the family. HUD may determine in certain instances that a PHA is not required to accept incoming portable families, such as a PHA in a declared disaster area. However, the PHA must have approval in writing from HUD before refusing any incoming portable families.

      (c)  The following portability procedures must be followed:

      (1) When the family decides to use the voucher outside of the PHA jurisdiction, the family must notify the initial PHA of its desire to relocate and must specify the location where it wants to live.

      (2) The initial PHA must determine the family's eligibility to move in accordance with §§ 982.353 and 982.354.

      (3) Once the receiving PHA is determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the initial PHA must contact the receiving PHA, via email or other confirmed delivery method, prior to approving the family's request to move in order to determine whether the voucher will be absorbed or billed by the receiving PHA. The receiving PHA must advise the initial PHA in writing, via email or other confirmed delivery method, of its decision.

      (4) If the receiving PHA notifies the initial PHA that it will absorb the voucher, the receiving PHA cannot reverse its decision at a later date without consent of the initial PHA.

      (5) If the receiving PHA will bill the initial PHA for the portability voucher and the cost of the HAP will increase due to the move, the initial PHA may deny the move if it does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance in accordance with § 982.354 (e)(1).

      (6) If a billing arrangement is approved by the initial PHA or if the voucher is to be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA must issue the family a voucher to move, if it has not already done so, and advise the family how to contact and request assistance from the receiving PHA.

      (7) The initial PHA must promptly notify the receiving PHA to expect the family. The initial PHA must give the receiving PHA the form HUD-52665, the most recent form HUD 50058 (Family Report) for the family, and all related verification information.

      (8) The family must promptly contact the receiving PHA in order to be informed of the receiving PHA's procedures for incoming portable families and comply with these procedures. The family's failure to comply may result in denial or termination of the receiving PHA's voucher.

      (9) The receiving PHA does not redetermine eligibility for a participant family. However, for a family that was not already receiving assistance in the PHA's HCV program, the initial PHA must determine whether the family is eligible for admission to the receiving PHA's HCV program. In determining income eligibility, the receiving PHA's income limits are used by the initial PHA.

      (10) When a receiving PHA assists a family under portability, administration of the voucher must be in accordance with the receiving PHA's policies. This requirement also applies to policies of Moving to Work agencies. The receiving PHA procedures and preferences for selection among eligible applicants do not apply to the family, and the receiving PHA waiting list is not used.

      (11) If the receiving PHA opts to conduct a new reexamination for a current participant family, the receiving PHA may not delay issuing the family a voucher or otherwise delay approval of a unit.

      (12) The receiving PHA must determine the family unit size for the family, and base its determination on the subsidy standards of the receiving PHA.

      (13) The receiving PHA must issue a voucher to the family. The term of the receiving PHA voucher may not expire before 30 calendar days from the expiration date of the initial PHA voucher. If the voucher expires before the family arrives at the receiving PHA, the receiving PHA must contact the initial PHA to determine if it will extend the voucher.

      (14) Once the receiving PHA issues the portable family a voucher, the receiving PHA's policies on extensions of the voucher term apply. The receiving PHA must notify the initial PHA of any extensions granted to the term of the voucher.

      (15) The family must submit a request for tenancy approval to the receiving PHA during the term of the receiving PHA voucher. As required in § 982.303, if the family submits a request for tenancy approval during the term of the voucher, the PHA must suspend the term of that voucher.

      (16) The receiving PHA must promptly notify the initial PHA if the family has leased an eligible unit under the program, or if the family fails to submit a request for tenancy approval for an eligible unit within the term of the voucher.

      (17) At any time, either the initial PHA or the receiving PHA may make a determination to deny or terminate assistance to the family in accordance with § 982.552 and 982.553.

      (d)  (1) If funding is available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program, the receiving PHA may absorb the family into the receiving PHA's HCV program. After absorption, the family is assisted with funds available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program.

      (2) HUD may require that the receiving PHA absorb all, or a portion of, incoming portable families. Under circumstances described in a notice published in the  HUD may determine that receiving PHAs, or categories of receiving PHAs, should absorb all or a portion of incoming portable families. If HUD makes such a determination, HUD will provide an opportunity for public comment, for a period of no less than 60 calendar days, on such policy and procedures. After consideration of public comments, HUD will publish a final notice in the  advising PHAs and the public of HUD's final determination on the subject of mandatory absorption of incoming portable families.

      (3) HUD may provide financial or nonfinancial incentives (or both) to PHAs that absorb portability vouchers.

      (e)  (1) To cover assistance for a portable family that was not absorbed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the receiving PHA may bill the initial PHA for housing assistance payments and administrative fees.

      (2) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the full amount of the housing assistance payments made by the receiving PHA for the portable family. The amount of the housing assistance payment for a portable family in the receiving PHA program is determined in the same manner as for other families in the receiving PHA program.

      (3) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's ongoing administrative fee for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month for which the receiving PHA is billing the initial PHA under this section. If administrative fees are prorated for the HCV program, the proration will apply to the amount of the administrative fee for which the receiving PHA may bill under this section (e.g., the receiving PHA may bill for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee). If both PHAs agree, the PHAs may negotiate a different amount of reimbursement.

      (4) When a portable family moves out of the HCV program of a receiving PHA that has not absorbed the family, the PHA in the new jurisdiction to which the family moves becomes the receiving PHA, and the first receiving PHA is no longer required to provide assistance for the family.

      (5) In administration of portability, the initial PHA and the receiving PHA must comply with financial procedures required by HUD, including the use of HUD-required billing forms. The initial and receiving PHA must also comply with billing and payment deadlines under the financial procedures.

      (6) A PHA must manage the PHA HCV program in a manner that ensures that the PHA has the financial ability to provide assistance for families that move out of the PHA's program under the portability procedures, and that have not been absorbed by the receiving PHA, as well as for families that remain in the PHA's program.

      (7) HUD may reduce the administrative fee to an initial or receiving PHA if the PHA does not comply with HUD portability requirements.

      (f)  (1) HUD may transfer units and funds for assistance to portable families to the receiving PHA from funds available under the initial PHA ACC.

      (2) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the initial PHA for funds transferred to a receiving PHA for portability purposes.

      (3) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the receiving PHA for absorption of portable families.

      (4) HUD may require the receiving PHA to absorb portable families.

      (g)  (1) The initial PHA must submit the codes used for special purpose vouchers on the form HUD-50058, Family Report, and the receiving PHA must maintain the codes on the Family Report, as long as the Receiving PHA chooses to bill the initial PHA.

      (2) Initial and receiving PHAs must administer special purpose vouchers, such as the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing vouchers, in accordance with HUD-established policy in cases where HUD has established alternative program requirements of such special purpose vouchers.

    Subpart I—Dwelling Unit: Housing Quality Standards, Subsidy Standards, Inspection and Maintenance

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.401   Housing quality standards.

#### § § 982.401

      As defined in § 982.4, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3).

> [89 FR 38296, May 7, 2024]

      § 982.402   Subsidy standards.

#### § § 982.402

      (a)  (1) The PHA must establish subsidy standards that determine the number of bedrooms needed for families of different sizes and compositions.

      (2) For each family, the PHA determines the appropriate number of bedrooms under the PHA subsidy standards (family unit size).

      (3) The family unit size number is entered on the voucher issued to the family. The PHA issues the family a voucher for the family unit size when a family is selected for participation in the program.

      (b)  The following requirements apply when the PHA determines family unit size under the PHA subsidy standards:

      (1) The subsidy standards must provide for the smallest number of bedrooms needed to house a family without overcrowding.

      (2) The subsidy standards must be consistent with space requirements under the HQS (See § 982.401).

      (3) The subsidy standards must be applied consistently for all families of like size and composition.

      (4) A child who is temporarily away from the home because of placement in foster care is considered a member of the family in determining the family unit size.

      (5) A family that consists of a pregnant woman (with no other persons) must be treated as a two-person family.

      (6) Any live-in aide (approved by the PHA to reside in the unit to care for a family member who is disabled or is at least 50 years of age) must be counted in determining the family unit size;

      (7) Unless a live-in-aide resides with the family, the family unit size for any family consisting of a single person must be either a zero or one-bedroom unit, as determined under the PHA subsidy standards.

      (8) In determining family unit size for a particular family, the PHA may grant an exception to its established subsidy standards if the PHA determines that the exception is justified by the age, sex, health, handicap, or relationship of family members or other personal circumstances. (For a single person other than a disabled or elderly person or remaining family member, such PHA exception may not override the limitation in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.)

      (c)  The family unit size as determined for a family under the PHA subsidy standard is used to determine the maximum rent subsidy for a family assisted in the voucher program. For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standard for a family shall be the lower of:

      (1) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or

      (2) The payment standard amount for the unit size of the unit rented by the family.

      (3)  For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standards for the family must be the lower of:

      (i) The payment standards for the family unit size; or

      (ii) The payment standard for the unit size rented by the family.

      (d)  (1) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with fewer bedrooms than the family unit size. However, the dwelling unit must meet the applicable HQS space requirements.

      (2) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with more bedrooms than the family unit size. However, utility allowances must follow § 982.517(d).

> [60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998; 64 FR 26646, May 14, 1999; 81 FR 12375, Mar. 8, 2016; 88 FR 30503, May 11, 2023; 89 FR 38296, May 7, 2024; 89 FR 46020, May 28, 2024]

      § 982.403   Terminating HAP contract when unit is too small.

#### § § 982.403

      (a)  (1) If the PHA determines that a unit does not meet the HQS space standards because of an increase in family size or a change in family composition, the PHA must issue the family a new voucher, and the family and PHA must try to find an acceptable unit as soon as possible.

      (2) If an acceptable unit is available for rental by the family, the PHA must terminate the HAP contract in accordance with its terms.

      (b)  When the PHA terminates the HAP contract under paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) The PHA must notify the family and the owner of the termination; and

      (2) The HAP contract terminates at the end of the calendar month that follows the calendar month in which the PHA gives such notice to the owner.

      (3) The family may move to a new unit in accordance with § 982.354.

> [60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 45661, Sept. 1, 1995; 64 FR 26647, May 14, 1999; 80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015; 80 FR 50575, Aug. 20, 2015]

      § 982.404   Maintenance: Owner and family responsibility; PHA remedies.

#### § § 982.404

      (a)  (1) The owner must maintain the unit in accordance with HQS. A unit is not in compliance with HQS if the PHA or other inspector authorized by the State or local government determines that the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection, the agency or inspector notifies the owner in writing of the HQS deficiencies, and the deficiencies are not remedied within the appropriate timeframe.

      (2) If the owner fails to maintain the dwelling unit in accordance with HQS, the PHA must take enforcement action in accordance with this section.

      (3) If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days of notification (or any reasonable PHA-approved extension).

      (4) In the case of an HQS deficiency that the PHA determines is caused by the tenant, any member of the household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, other than any damage resulting from ordinary use, the PHA may waive the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation. The HAP to the owner may not be withheld or abated if the owner responsibility has been waived. However, the PHA may terminate assistance to a family because of an HQS breach beyond damage resulting from ordinary use caused by any member of the household or any guest or other person under the tenant's control.

      (b)  (1) The family may be held responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:

      (i) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the owner is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the tenant;

      (ii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the owner is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the tenant; or

      (iii) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear)

      (2) If the PHA has waived the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the following applies:

      (i) If the HQS breach caused by the family is life-threatening, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 24 hours of notification.

      (ii) For other family-caused deficiencies, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure that the deficiency is corrected within 30 calendar days of notification (or any PHA-approved extension).

      (3) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for the family in accordance with § 982.552.

      (c)  The unit is in noncompliance with HQS if:

      (1) The PHA or authorized inspector determines the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection;

      (2) The PHA notified the owner in writing of the unit HQS deficiencies; and

      (3) The unit HQS deficiencies are not corrected in accordance with the timeframes established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (d)  This subsection covers PHA actions when HQS deficiencies are identified as a result of an inspection other than the initial inspection (see § 982.405). For PHA HQS enforcement actions for HQS deficiencies under the initial HQS inspection NLT or alternative inspection options, see §§ 982.405(j) and 982.406(e), respectively.

      (1) A PHA may withhold assistance payments for units that have HQS deficiencies once the PHA has notified the owner in writing of the deficiencies. The PHA must identify in its Administrative Plan the conditions under which it will withhold HAP. If the unit is brought into compliance during the applicable cure period (within 24 hours of notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days of notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies), the PHA:

      (i) Must resume assistance payments; and

      (ii) Must provide assistance payments to cover the time period for which the assistance payments were withheld.

      (2)(i) The PHA must abate the HAP, including amounts that had been withheld, if the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable cure period (within 24 hours of notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days of notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies).

      (ii) If a PHA abates the assistance payments under this paragraph, the PHA must notify the family and the owner that it is abating payments and that if the unit does not meet HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) after the determination of noncompliance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the unit, and the family will have to move if the family wishes to receive continued assistance. The PHA must issue the family its voucher to move at least 30 days prior to the termination of the HAP contract.

      (3) An owner may not terminate the tenancy of any family due to the withholding or abatement of assistance under paragraph (a) of this section. During the period that assistance is abated, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner and the PHA. If the family chooses to terminate the tenancy, the HAP contract will automatically terminate on the effective date of the tenancy termination or the date the family vacates the unit, whichever is earlier. The PHA must promptly issue the family its voucher to move.

      (4) If the family did not terminate the tenancy and the owner makes the repairs and the unit complies with HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner. The PHA does not make any payments to the owner for the period of time that the payments were abated.

      (5) If the owner fails to make the repairs within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must terminate the HAP contract.

      (e)  (1) The PHA must give any family residing in a unit for which the HAP contract is terminated under paragraph (d)(5) of this section due to a failure to correct HQS deficiencies at least 90 days or a longer period as the PHA determines is reasonably necessary following the termination of the HAP contract to lease a new unit.

      (2) If the family is unable to lease a new unit within the period provided by the PHA under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the PHA owns or operates public housing, the PHA must offer, and, if accepted, provide the family a selection preference for an appropriate-size public housing unit that first becomes available for occupancy after the time period expires.

      (3) PHAs may assist families relocating under this paragraph (e) in finding a new unit, including using up to 2 months of the withheld and abated assistance payments for costs directly associated with relocating to a new unit, including security deposits, temporary housing costs, or other reasonable moving costs as determined by the PHA based on their locality. If the PHA uses the withheld and abated assistance payments to assist with the family's relocation costs, the PHA must provide security deposit assistance to the family as necessary. PHAs must assist families with disabilities in locating available accessible units in accordance with 24 CFR 8.28(a)(3). If the family receives security deposit assistance from the PHA for the new unit, the PHA may require the family to remit the security deposit returned by the owner of the new unit at such time that the lease is terminated, up to the amount of the security deposit assistance provided by the PHA for that unit. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the policies it will implement for this provision.

      (f)  This section is applicable to HAP contracts that were either executed on or after or renewed after June 6, 2024. For purposes of this paragraph, a HAP contract is renewed if the HAP contract continues beyond the initial term of the lease. For all other HAP contracts, § 982.404 as in effect on June 6, 2024 remains applicable.

      § 982.405   PHA unit inspection.

#### § § 982.405

      (a)  The PHA must inspect the unit leased to a family prior to the initial term of the lease to determine if the unit meets the HQS. ( § 982.305(b)(2) concerning timing of initial inspection by the PHA.)

      (b)  The PHA must inspect the unit at least biennially during assisted occupancy to ensure that the unit continues to meet the HQS, except that a small rural PHA, as defined in § 902.101 of this title, must inspect a unit once every three years during assisted occupancy to ensure that the unit continues to meet the HQS.

      (c)  The PHA must conduct supervisory quality control HQS inspections.

      (d)  When a participant family or government official notifies the PHA of a potential deficiency, the following conditions apply:

      (1)  If the reported deficiency is life-threatening, the PHA must, within 24 hours of notification, both inspect the housing unit and notify the owner if the life-threatening deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 24 hours of PHA notification.

      (2)  If the reported deficiency is non-life-threatening, the PHA must, within 15 days of notification, both inspect the unit and notify the owner if the deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 30 days of notification from the PHA or within any PHA-approved extension.

      (3)  In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may approve an exception of the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.

      (e)  In scheduling inspections, the PHA must consider complaints and any other information brought to the attention of the PHA.

      (f)  The PHA must notify the owner of deficiencies shown by the inspection.

      (g)  The PHA may not charge the family for an initial inspection or reinspection of the unit.

      (h)  The PHA may not charge the owner for the inspection of the unit prior to the initial term of the lease or for a first inspection during assisted occupancy of the unit. The PHA may establish a reasonable fee to owners for a reinspection if an owner notifies the PHA that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible for repairing, pursuant to § 982.404(a), was not corrected. The owner may not pass this fee along to the family. Fees collected under this paragraph (h) will be included in a PHA's administrative fee reserve and may be used only for activities related to the provision of the HCV program.

      (i)  When a PHA must verify correction of a deficiency, the PHA may use verification methods other than another on-site inspection. The PHA may establish different verification methods for initial and non-initial inspections or for different HQS deficiencies. Upon either an inspection for initial occupancy or a reinspection, the PHA may accept photographic evidence or other reliable evidence from the owner to verify that a deficiency has been corrected.

      (j)  (1) A PHA may elect to approve an assisted tenancy, execute the HAP contract, and begin making assistance payments for a unit that failed the initial HQS inspection, provided that the unit has no life-threatening deficiencies. A PHA that implements this option (NLT option) may apply the option to all the PHA's initial inspections or may limit the use of the option to certain units. The PHA's Administrative Plan must specify the circumstances under which the PHA will exercise the NLT option. If the PHA has established, and the unit is covered by, both the NLT option and the alternative inspections option for the initial HQS inspection, see § 982.406(f).

      (2) The PHA must notify the owner and the family if the NLT option is available for the unit selected by the family. After completing the inspection and determining there are no life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA provides both the owner and the family with a list of all the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and, should the owner not complete the repairs within 30 days, the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will terminate the HAP contract, and the family will have to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. The family may choose to decline the unit based on the deficiencies and continue its housing search.

      (3) If the family decides to lease the unit, the PHA and the owner execute the HAP contract, and the family enters into the assisted lease with the owner. The PHA commences making assistance payments to the owner.

      (4) The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA may use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (5) A PHA relying on the non-life-threatening inspection provision must identify in the PHA Administrative Plan all the optional policies identified in § 982.54(d)(21)(i) and (ii).

      (6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:

      (i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and

      (ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.

> [89 FR 38298, May 7, 2024]

      § 982.406   Use of alternative inspections.

#### § § 982.406

      (a)  A PHA may comply with the inspection requirements in § 982.405(a) and (b) by relying on an alternative inspection ( an inspection conducted for another housing program) only if the PHA is able to obtain the results of the alternative inspection. The PHA may implement the use of alternative inspections for both initial and periodic inspections or may limit the use of alternative inspections to either initial or periodic inspections. The PHA may limit the use of alternative inspections to certain units, as provided in the PHA's Administrative Plan.

      (b)  A PHA relying on an alternative inspection must identify in the PHA Administrative Plan all the optional policies identified in § 982.54(d)(21)(iii).

      (c)  (1) A PHA may rely upon inspections of housing assisted under the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program or housing financed using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), or inspections performed by HUD.

      (2) If a PHA wishes to rely on an inspection method other than a method listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then, prior to amending its Administrative Plan, the PHA must submit to the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) a copy of the inspection method it wishes to use, along with its analysis of the inspection method that shows that the method “provides the same or greater protection to occupants of dwelling units” as would HQS.

      (i) A PHA may rely upon such alternative inspection method only upon receiving approval from REAC to do so.

      (ii) A PHA that uses an alternative inspection method approved under this paragraph must monitor changes to the standards and requirements applicable to such method. If any change is made to the alternative inspection method, then the PHA must submit to REAC a copy of the revised standards and requirements, along with a revised comparison to HQS. If the PHA or REAC determines that the revision would cause the alternative inspection to no longer meet or exceed HQS, then the PHA may no longer rely upon the alternative inspection method to comply with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a) and (b).

      (d)  (1) If an alternative inspection method employs sampling, then a PHA may rely on such alternative inspection method for purposes of an initial or periodic inspection only if units occupied by voucher program participants are included in the population of units forming the basis of the sample.

      (2) In order for a PHA to rely upon the results of an alternative inspection for purposes of an initial or periodic inspection, a property inspected pursuant to such method must meet the standards or requirements regarding housing quality or safety applicable to properties assisted under the program using the alternative inspection method. To make the determination of whether such standards or requirements are met, the PHA must adhere to the following procedures:

      (i) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “pass” score, then the PHA may rely on that inspection.

      (ii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “fail” score, then the PHA may not rely on that inspection.

      (iii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method that does not employ a pass/fail determination—for example, in the case of a program where deficiencies are simply identified—then the PHA must review the list of deficiencies to determine whether any cited deficiency would have resulted in a “fail” score under HQS. If no such deficiency exists, then the PHA may rely on the inspection. If such a deficiency does exist, then the PHA may not rely on the inspection.

      (3) Under any circumstance described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in which a PHA is prohibited from relying on an alternative inspection method for a property, the PHA must, within a reasonable period of time, conduct an HQS inspection of any units in the property occupied by voucher program participants and follow HQS procedures to remedy any identified deficiencies.

      (e)  (1) The PHA may approve the tenancy, allow the family to enter into the lease agreement, and execute the HAP contract for a unit that has been inspected in the previous 24 months where the alternative inspection meets the requirements of this section. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option under § 982.405(j) and the alternative inspections option for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (f) of this section.

      (2) The PHA notifies the owner and the family that the unit selected by the family is eligible for the alternative inspection option. The PHA must provide the family with the PHA list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. If the owner and family agree to the use of this option, the PHA approves the assisted tenancy, allows the family to enter into the lease agreement with the owner, and executes the HAP contract on the basis of the alternative inspection.

      (3) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days of receiving the Request for Tenancy Approval. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's HQS inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under § 982.405(d) or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.

      (4) The PHA must enter into the HAP contract with the owner before conducting the HQS inspection. The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected the unit.

      (5) The PHA may commence housing assistance payments to the owner and make housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract only after the unit passes the PHA's HQS inspection. If the unit does not pass the HQS inspection, the PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected. If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within no more than 30 calendar days (or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:

      (i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner does not correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and

      (ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (f)  (1) The PHA notifies the owner and the family that both the alternative inspection option and the NLT option are available for the unit selected by the family. The PHA must provide the family the list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. If the owner and family agree to the use of both options, the PHA approves the assisted tenancy, allows the family to enter into the lease agreement with the owner, and executes the HAP contract on the basis of the alternative inspection.

      (2) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days after the family and owner submit a complete Request for Tenancy Approval. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's HQS inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under § 982.405(d) or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.

      (3) The PHA must enter into the HAP contract with the owner before conducting the HQS inspection. The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected the unit. If the unit passes the HQS inspection, the PHA commences making housing assistance payments to the owner and makes payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (4) If the unit fails the PHA's HQS inspection but has no life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA commences making housing assistance payments, which are made retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract. The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the unit is in compliance with HQS, the PHA may use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (5) If the unit does not pass the HQS inspection and has life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA may not commence making housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected. The owner must correct all life-threatening deficiencies within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 days (or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:

      (i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and

      (ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (g) Records retention. As with all other inspection reports, and as required by § 982.158(f)(4), reports for inspections conducted pursuant to an alternative inspection method must be obtained by the PHA. Such reports must be available for HUD inspection for at least three years from the date of the latest inspection.

**Source:** Source: 60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.451   Housing assistance payments contract.

#### § § 982.451

      (a)  (1) The HAP contract must be in the form required by HUD.

      (2) The term of the HAP contract is the same as the term of the lease.

      (b)  (1) The amount of the monthly housing assistance payment by the PHA to the owner is determined by the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements. The amount of the housing assistance payment is subject to change during the HAP contract term.

      (2) The monthly housing assistance payment by the PHA is credited toward the monthly rent to owner under the family's lease.

      (3) The total of rent paid by the tenant plus the PHA housing assistance payment to the owner may not be more than the rent to owner. The owner must immediately return any excess payment to the PHA.

      (4)(i) The part of the rent to owner that is paid by the tenant may not be more than:

      (A) The rent to owner; minus

      (B) The PHA housing assistance payment to the owner.

      (ii) The owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of this maximum, and must immediately return any excess rent payment to the tenant.

      (iii) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the PHA. See § 982.310(b).

      (5)(i) The PHA must pay the housing assistance payment promptly when due to the owner in accordance with the HAP contract.

      (ii)(A) The HAP contract shall provide for penalties against the PHA for late payment of housing assistance payments due to the owner if all the following circumstances apply:

      () Such penalties are in accordance with generally accepted practices and law, as applicable in the local housing market, governing penalties for late payment of rent by a tenant;

      () It is the owner's practice to charge such penalties for assisted and unassisted tenants; and

      () The owner also charges such penalties against the tenant for late payment of family rent to owner.

      (B) The PHA is not obligated to pay any late payment penalty if HUD determines that late payment by the PHA is due to factors beyond the PHA's control. The PHA may add HAP contract provisions which define when the housing assistance payment by the PHA is deemed received by the owner ( upon mailing by the PHA or actual receipt by the owner).

      (iii) The PHA may only use the following sources to pay a late payment penalty from program receipts under the consolidated ACC: administrative fee income for the program, or the administrative fee reserve for the program. The PHA may not use other program receipts for this purpose.

      (b) The owner is responsible for:

      (1) Performing all management and rental functions for the assisted unit, including selecting a voucher-holder to lease the unit, and deciding if the family is suitable for tenancy of the unit. The fact that an applicant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking is not an appropriate basis for denial of tenancy if the applicant otherwise qualifies for tenancy.

      (2) Maintaining the unit in accordance with HQS, including performance of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. For provisions on family maintenance responsibilities, see § 982.404(a)(4).

      (3) Complying with equal opportunity requirements.

      (4) Preparing and furnishing to the PHA information required under the HAP contract.

      (iii) Any charges for unit damage by the family.

      (6) Enforcing tenant obligations under the lease.

      (7) Paying for utilities and services (unless paid by the family under the lease).

      (c) For provisions on modifications to a dwelling unit occupied or to be occupied by a disabled person, see 24 CFR 100.203.

    Subpart K—Rent and Housing Assistance Payment

**Source:** Source: 63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

      § 982.501   Overview.

#### § § 982.501

      This subpart describes program requirements concerning the housing assistance payment and rent to owner under the HCV program.

> [80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015]

      § 982.503   Payment standard areas, schedule, and amounts.

#### § § 982.503

      (a)  (1) Annually, HUD publishes fair market rents (FMRs) for U.S. Postal Service ZIP code areas, metropolitan areas, and nonmetropolitan counties (see 24 CFR 888.113). Within each of these FMR areas, the applicable FMR is:

      (i) The HUD-published Small Area FMR for:

      (A) Any metropolitan area designated as a Small Area FMR area by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1).

      (B) Any area where a PHA has notified HUD that the PHA will voluntarily use SAFMRs in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3).

      (ii) The HUD-published metropolitan FMR for any other metropolitan area.

      (iii) The HUD-published FMR for any other non-metropolitan county.

      (2) The PHA must adopt a payment standard schedule that establishes voucher payment standard amounts for each FMR area in the PHA jurisdiction. These payment standard amounts are used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family (§ 982.505).

      (3) The PHA may designate payment standard areas within each FMR area. The PHA may establish different payment standard amounts for such designated areas. If the PHA designates payment standard areas, then it must include in its Administrative Plan the criteria used to determine the designated areas and the payment standard amounts for those areas.

      (i) The PHA may designate payment standard areas within which payment standards will be established according to paragraph (c) (basic range) or paragraph (d) (exception payment standard), of this section.

      (ii) A PHA-designated payment standard area may be no smaller than a census tract block group.

      (b)  For each payment standard area, the PHA must establish a payment standard amount for each unit size, measured by number of bedrooms (zero-bedroom, one-bedroom, and so on). These payment standard amounts comprise the PHA's payment standard schedule.

      (c)  A basic range payment standard amount is any dollar amount that is in the range from 90 percent up to 110 percent of the published FMR for a unit size.

      (1) The PHA may establish a payment standard amount within the basic range without HUD approval or prior notification to HUD.

      (2) The PHA's basic range payment standard amount for each unit size may be based on the same percentage of the published FMR ( all payment standard amounts may be set at 100 percent of the FMR), or the PHA may establish different payment standard amounts for different unit sizes (for example, 90 percent for efficiencies, 100 percent for 1-bedroom units, 110 percent for larger units).

      (3) The PHA must revise its payment standard amounts and schedule no later than 3 months following the effective date of the published FMR if revisions are necessary to stay within the basic range.

      (d)  An exception payment standard amount is a dollar amount that exceeds 110 percent of the published FMR.

      (1) The PHA may establish exception payment standard amounts for all units, or for units of a particular size. The exception payment standard may be established for a designated part of the FMR area (called an “exception area”) or for the entire FMR area. The exception area must meet the minimum area requirement at § 982.503(a)(3)(ii).

      (2) A PHA that is not in a designated Small Area FMR area or has not opted voluntarily to implement Small Area FMRs under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3) may establish exception payment standards for a ZIP code area that exceed the basic range for the metropolitan area or county FMR as long as the amounts established by the PHA do not exceed 110 percent of the HUD published SAFMR for the applicable ZIP code. The exception payment standard must apply to the entire ZIP code area. If an exception area crosses one or more FMR boundaries, then the maximum exception payment standard amount that a PHA may adopt for the exception area without HUD approval is 110 percent of the ZIP code area with the lowest SAFMR amount. If the PHA qualifies for an exception payment standard above 110 percent of the applicable FMR under paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, it may establish exception payment standards up to the same percentage of the SAFMR for the applicable ZIP code.

      (3) A PHA may establish exception payment standard amounts between 110 percent and 120 percent of the applicable FMR for such duration as HUD specifies by notice upon notification to HUD that the PHA meets at least one of the following criteria:

      (i) Fewer than 75 percent of the families to whom the PHA issued tenant-based rental vouchers during the most recent 12-month period for which there is success rate data available have become participants in the voucher program;

      (ii) More than 40 percent of families with tenant-based rental assistance administered by the agency pay more than 30 percent of adjusted income as the family share; or

      (iii) Such other criteria as the Secretary establishes by notice.

      (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (5) of this section, the PHA must request approval from HUD to establish an exception payment standard amount that exceeds 110 percent of the applicable FMR. In its request to HUD, the PHA must provide rental market data demonstrating that the requested exception payment standard amount is needed for families to access rental units. The rental market data must include a rent estimate for the entire FMR area compared with a rent estimate for the proposed exception area. To apply the exception payment standard to the entire FMR area, the rental market data provided by the PHA must also provide data that demonstrates that the annual percentage of rent inflation in the FMR area is greater than the rental inflation adjustment factor in the calculation of the published FMR. Once HUD has approved the exception payment standard for the requesting PHA, any other PHA with jurisdiction in the HUD approved exception payment standard area may also use the exception payment standard amount.

      (5) If required as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 for a person with a disability, the PHA may establish, without HUD approval or prior notification to HUD, an exception payment standard amount for an individual family that does not exceed 120 percent of the applicable FMR. A PHA may establish a payment standard greater than 120 percent of the applicable FMR as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability in accordance with 24 CFR part 8, after requesting and receiving HUD approval.

      (e)  HUD may consider a PHA request for approval to establish a payment standard amount that is lower than the basic range. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve PHA establishment of a payment standard lower than the basic range. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including rent burden of families assisted under the program. Unless it is necessary to prevent termination of program participants, HUD will not approve a lower payment standard if the proposed payment standard would, if it were used to calculate the housing assistance payments for current participants in the PHA's voucher program using currently available data, cause the family share for more than 40 percent of participants with tenant-based rental assistance to exceed 30 percent of adjusted monthly income.

      (f)  HUD will no longer approve success rate payment standards. However, a PHA that was approved to establish a success rate payment standard amount under this paragraph as in effect prior to June 6, 2024 shall not be required to reduce such payment standard amount as a result of the discontinuance of success rate payment standards.

      (g)  This paragraph applies only to a PHA with jurisdiction in an FMR area where the FMR had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent to provide a broad range of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area, pursuant to 24 CFR 888.113(i)(3), but is now set at the 40th percentile rent.

      (1) Such a PHA may obtain HUD Field Office approval of a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent if the PHA scored the maximum number of points on the deconcentration bonus indicator in 24 CFR 985.3(h) in the prior year, or in two of the last three years.

      (2) HUD approval of payment standard amounts based on the 50th percentile rent shall be for all unit sizes in the FMR area that had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent pursuant to 24 CFR 888.113(i)(3). A PHA may opt to establish a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent for one or more unit sizes in all or a designated part of the PHA jurisdiction within the FMR area.

      (h)  (1) HUD will monitor rent burdens of families assisted with tenant-based rental assistance in a PHA's voucher program. HUD will review the PHA's payment standard for a particular unit size if HUD finds that 40 percent or more of such families occupying units of that unit size currently pay more than 30 percent of adjusted monthly income as the family share. Such determination may be based on the most recent examinations of family income.

      (2) After such review, HUD may, at its discretion, require the PHA to modify payment standard amounts for any unit size on the PHA payment standard schedule. HUD may require the PHA to establish an increased payment standard amount within the basic range.

      § 982.504   Payment standard for family in restructured subsidized multifamily project.

#### § § 982.504

      (a) This section applies to HCV assistance if all the following conditions are applicable:

      (1) Such HCV assistance is provided to a family pursuant to 24 CFR 401.421 when HUD has approved a restructuring plan, and the participating administrative entity has approved the use of tenant-based assistance to provide continued assistance for such families. Such tenant-based voucher assistance is provided for a family previously receiving project-based assistance in an eligible project (as defined in § 401.2 of this title) at the time when the project-based assistance terminates.

      (2) The family chooses to remain in the restructured project with HCV assistance under the program and leases a unit that does not exceed the family unit size;

      (3) The lease for such assisted tenancy commences during the first year after the project-based assistance terminates.

      (b) The initial payment standard for the family under such initial lease is the sum of the reasonable rent to owner for the unit plus the utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. (Determination of such initial payment standard for the family is not subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of § 982.505. Except for determination of the initial payment standard as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment standard and housing assistance payment for the family during the HAP contract term shall be determined in accordance with § 982.505.)

      § 982.505   How to calculate housing assistance payment.

#### § § 982.505

      (a)  A payment standard is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family. The “payment standard” is the maximum monthly subsidy payment.

      (b)  The PHA shall pay a monthly housing assistance payment on behalf of the family that is equal to the  of:

      (1) The payment standard for the family minus the total tenant payment; or

      (2) The gross rent minus the total tenant payment.

      (c) Payment standard for family—(1)  The payment standard for the family is the lower of:

      (i) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or

      (ii) The payment standard amount for the size of the dwelling unit rented by the family.

      (2)  If the PHA has established a separate payment standard amount for a designated part of an FMR area in accordance with § 982.503 (including an exception payment standard amount as determined in accordance with § 982.503(d)), and the dwelling unit is located in such designated part, the PHA must use the appropriate payment standard amount for such designated part to calculate the payment standard for the family.

      (3)  The PHA may choose not to reduce the payment standard amount used to calculate the subsidy for a family for as long as the family continues to reside in the unit for which the family is receiving assistance.

      (i) If the PHA chooses to reduce the payment standard amount used to calculate such a family's subsidy in accordance with its Administrative Plan, then the initial reduction to the family's payment standard amount may not be applied any earlier than two years following the effective date of the decrease in the payment standard, and then only if the family has received the notice required under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

      (ii) The PHA may choose to reduce the payment standard amount for the family to the current payment standard amount in effect on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule, or it may reduce the payment standard amount to an amount that is higher than the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule. After an initial reduction, the PHA may further reduce the payment standard amount for the family during the time the family resides in the unit, provided any subsequent reductions continue to result in a payment standard amount that meets or exceeds the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule.

      (iii) The PHA must provide the family with at least 12 months' written notice of any reduction in the payment standard amount that will affect the family if the family remains in place. In the written notice, the PHA must state the new payment standard amount, explain that the family's new payment standard amount will be the greater of the amount listed in the current written notice or the new amount (if any) on the PHA's payment standard schedule at the end of the 12-month period, and make clear where the family will find the PHA's payment standard schedule.

      (iv) The PHA must administer decreases in the payment standard amount for the family in accordance with the PHA policy as described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (4)  If the payment standard amount is increased during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA must use the increased payment standard amount to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning no later than the earliest of:

      (i) The effective date of an increase in the gross rent that would result in an increase in the family share;

      (ii) The family's first regular or interim reexamination; or

      (iii) One year following the effective date of the increase in the payment standard amount.

      (5)  The PHA may adopt a policy to apply a payment standard increase at any time earlier than the date calculated according to paragraph (c)(4).

      (6)  Irrespective of any increase or decrease in the payment standard amount, if the family unit size either increases or decreases during the HAP contract term, the new family unit size may be used to determine the payment standard amount for the family immediately but no later than the family's first regular reexamination following the change in family unit size.

      § 982.507   Rent to owner: Reasonable rent.

#### § § 982.507

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA may not approve a lease until the PHA determines that the initial rent to owner is a reasonable rent.

      (2) The PHA must redetermine the reasonable rent:

      (i) Before any increase in the rent to owner;

      (ii) If there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the contract anniversary (for the unit size rented by the family) as compared with the FMR in effect 1 year before the contract anniversary.

      (iii) If directed by HUD.

      (3) The PHA may also redetermine the reasonable rent at any other time.

      (4) At all times during the assisted tenancy, the rent to owner may not exceed the reasonable rent as most recently determined or redetermined by the PHA.

      (b)  The PHA must determine whether the rent to owner is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units. To make this determination, the PHA must consider:

      (1) The location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the contract unit; and

      (2) Any amenities, housing services, maintenance and utilities to be provided by the owner in accordance with the lease.

      (c)  (1)  For a unit receiving low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs) pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or receiving assistance under HUD's HOME Program (for which the regulations are found in 24 CFR part 92), a rent comparison with unassisted units is not required if the voucher rent does not exceed the rent for other LIHTC- or HOME-assisted units in the project that are not occupied by families with tenant-based assistance.

      (2)  If the rent requested by the owner exceeds the LIHTC rents for non-voucher families, the PHA must perform a rent comparability study in accordance with program regulations and the rent shall not exceed the lesser of the:

      (i) Reasonable rent as determined pursuant to a rent comparability study; and

      (ii) The payment standard established by the PHA for the unit size involved.

      (3)  [Reserved]

      (d)  By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.

      § 982.510   Other fees and charges.

#### § § 982.510

      (a) The cost of meals or supportive services may not be included in the rent to owner, and the value of meals or supportive services may not be included in the calculation of reasonable rent.

      (b) The lease may not require the tenant or family members to pay charges for meals or supportive services. Non-payment of such charges is not grounds for termination of tenancy.

      (c) The owner may not charge the tenant extra amounts for items customarily included in rent in the locality, or provided at no additional cost to unsubsidized tenants in the premises.

      § 982.514   Distribution of housing assistance payment.

#### § § 982.514

      The monthly housing assistance payment is distributed as follows:

      (a) The PHA pays the owner the lesser of the housing assistance payment or the rent to owner.

      (b) If the housing assistance payment exceeds the rent to owner, the PHA may pay the balance of the housing assistance payment (“utility reimbursement”) either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.

      (c) The PHA may elect to establish policies regarding the frequency of utility reimbursement payments for payments made to the family.

      (1) The PHA will have the option of making utility reimbursement payments not less than once per calendar-year quarter, for reimbursements totaling $45 or less per quarter. In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the PHA would be required to reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.

      (2) If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.

      § 982.515   Family share: Family responsibility.

#### § § 982.515

      (a) The family share is calculated by subtracting the amount of the housing assistance payment from the gross rent.

      (b) The family rent to owner is calculated by subtracting the amount of the housing assistance payment to the owner from the rent to owner.

      (c) The PHA may not use housing assistance payments or other program funds (including any administrative fee reserve) to pay any part of the family share, including the family rent to owner. Payment of the whole family share is the responsibility of the family.

      § 982.516   Family income and composition: Annual and interim examinations.

#### § § 982.516

      (a)  (1) The PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least annually.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the PHA must obtain and document in the tenant file third-party verification of the following factors, or must document in the tenant file why third-party verification was not available:

      (i) Reported family annual income;

      (ii) The value of assets;

      (iii) Expenses related to deductions from annual income; and

      (iv) Other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income.

      (3) For a family with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.

      (b) —(1)  A PHA may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (2)  For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:

      (i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.

      (ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.

      (iii) Annuities or other retirement benefit programs, insurance policies, disability or death benefits, or other similar types of periodic receipts.

      (iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.

      (3)  A PHA using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.

      (i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's fixed-income sources, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, the PHA is not required to make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income individually. The PHA must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (4)  PHAs using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.

      (5)  For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, a PHA must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.

      (c)  (1) A family may request an interim determination of family income or composition because of any changes since the last determination. The PHA must conduct any interim reexamination within a reasonable period of time after the family request or when the PHA becomes aware of an increase in family adjusted income under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. What qualifies as a “reasonable time” may vary based on the amount of time it takes to verify information, but generally should not be longer than 30 days after changes in income are reported.

      (2) The PHA may decline to conduct an interim reexamination of family income if the PHA estimates the family's adjusted income will decrease by an amount that is less than ten percent of the family's annual adjusted income (or a lower amount established by HUD through notice), or a lower threshold established by the PHA.

      (3) The PHA must conduct an interim reexamination of family income when the PHA becomes aware that the family's adjusted income (as defined in § 5.611 of this title) has changed by an amount that the PHA estimates will result in an increase of ten percent or more in annual adjusted income or such other amount established by HUD through notice, except:

      (i) The PHA may not consider any increase in the earned income of the family when estimating or calculating whether the family's adjusted income has increased, unless the family has previously received an interim reduction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section during the certification period; and

      (ii) The PHA may choose not to conduct an interim reexamination in the last three months of a certification period.

      (4)  (i) If the family has reported a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, the PHA must provide the family with 30 days advance notice of any family share and family rent to owner increases, and such increases will be effective the first day of the month beginning after the end of that 30-day period. Family share and family rent to owner decreases will be effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the reported change leading to the interim reexamination of family income.

      (ii) If the family has failed to report a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, PHAs must implement any resulting family share and family rent to owner increases retroactively to the first of the month following the date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income. Any resulting family share and family rent to owner decrease must be implemented no later than the first rent period following completion of the reexamination. However, a PHA may apply a family share and family rent to owner decrease retroactively at the discretion of the PHA, in accordance with the conditions established by the PHA in the Administrative Plan and subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.

      (iii) A retroactive family share and family rent to owner decrease may not be applied prior to the later of the first of the month following:

      (A) The date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income; or

      (B) The effective date of the family's most recent previous interim or annual reexamination (or initial examination if that was the family's last examination).

      (d)  The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.

      (e)  (1) The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing how to determine the effective date of a change in the housing assistance payment resulting from an interim redetermination.

      (2) At the effective date of a regular or interim reexamination, the PHA must make appropriate adjustments in the housing assistance payment in accordance with § 982.505.

      (f)  The PHA must establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary to assure that income data provided by applicant or participant families is complete and accurate. The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).

      (i) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their rent or family share as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Families will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for rent or family share.

      (ii) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (f) through a rulemaking published in the  for public comment.

      (g)  (1) As a condition of admission to or continued assistance under the program, the PHA shall require the family head, and such other family members as the PHA designates, to execute a HUD-approved release and consent form (including any release and consent as required under § 5.230 of this title) authorizing any depository or private source of income, or any Federal, State or local agency, to furnish or release to the PHA or HUD such information as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary.

      (2) The PHA and HUD must limit the use or disclosure of information obtained from a family or from another source pursuant to this release and consent to purposes directly in connection with administration of the program.

      (h) Reviews of family income under this section are subject to the provisions in section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3544).

      § 982.517   Utility allowance schedule.

#### § § 982.517

      (a)  (1) The PHA must maintain a utility allowance schedule for all tenant-paid utilities (except telephone), for cost of tenant-supplied refrigerators and ranges, and for other tenant-paid housing services (e.g., trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse)).

      (2) The PHA must provide a copy of the utility allowance schedule to HUD. At HUD's request, the PHA also must provide any information or procedures used in preparation of the schedule.

      (b)  (1)(i) A PHA's utility allowance schedule, and the utility allowance for an individual family, must include the utilities and services that are necessary in the locality to provide housing that complies with HQS. The PHA's utility allowance schedule and utility allowance for families must also include any utilities and services required by HUD after publication in the  for public comment.

      (ii) In the utility allowance schedule, the PHA must classify utilities and other housing services according to the following general categories: space heating; air conditioning; cooking; water heating; water; sewer; trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse); other electric; refrigerator (cost of tenant-supplied refrigerator); range (cost of tenant-supplied range); applicable surcharges; and other specified housing services.

      (iii) The PHA must provide a utility allowance for tenant-paid air-conditioning costs if the majority of housing units in the market provide centrally air-conditioned units or there is appropriate wiring for tenant-installed air conditioners.

      (iv) The PHA may not provide any allowance for non-essential utility costs, such as costs of cable or satellite television.

      (2)(i) The PHA must maintain an area-wide utility allowance schedule. The area-wide utility allowance schedule must be determined based on the typical cost of utilities and services paid by energy-conservative households that occupy housing of similar size and type in the same locality. In developing the schedule, the PHA must use normal patterns of consumption for the community as a whole and current utility rates.

      (ii) The PHA may maintain an area-wide, energy-efficient utility allowance schedule to be used for units that are in a building that meets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or Energy Star standards. HUD may subsequently identify additional Energy Savings Design standards or criteria for applying the allowance to retrofitted units in a building that does not meet the standard, which will be modified or added through a document published in the  for 30 days of public comment, followed by a final document announcing the modified standards and the date on which the modifications take effect. The energy-efficient utility allowance (EEUA) schedule is to be maintained in addition to, not in place of, the area-wide utility allowance schedule described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, unless all units within a PHA's jurisdiction meet one or more of the required standards.

      (iii) The PHA may base its utility allowance payments on actual flat fees charged by an owner for utilities that are billed directly by the owner, but only if the flat fee charged by the owner is no greater than the PHA's applicable utility allowance for the utilities covered by the fee. If an owner charges a flat fee for only some of the utilities, then the PHA must pay a separate allowance for any tenant-paid utilities that are not covered in the flat fee.

      (iv) For tenant-based participants residing in units within a project that has an approved project-specific utility allowance under § 983.301(f)(4), the PHA must use the project-specific utility allowance schedule (see 24 CFR 983.301(f)(4)).

      (v) The PHA must state its policy for utility allowance payments in its Administrative Plan and apply it consistently to all similarly situated households.

      (c)  (1) A PHA must review its schedule of utility allowances each year, and must revise its allowance for a utility category if there has been a change of 10 percent or more in the utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised. The PHA must maintain information supporting its annual review of utility allowances and any revisions made in its utility allowance schedule.

      (2) At HUD's direction, the PHA must revise the utility allowance schedule to correct any errors, or as necessary to update the schedule.

      (d)  The PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the lesser of the size of dwelling unit actually leased by the family or the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards. In cases where the unit size leased exceeds the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards as a result of a reasonable accommodation, the PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the size of the dwelling unit actually leased by the family.

      (e)  On request from a household that includes a person with disabilities, the PHA must approve a utility allowance which is higher than the applicable amount on the utility allowance schedule if a higher utility allowance is needed as a reasonable accommodation under 24 CFR part 8, the Fair Housing Act and 24 CFR part 100, or Titles II or III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, to make the program accessible to and usable by the household member with a disability.

      § 982.521   Rent to owner in subsidized project.

#### § § 982.521

      (a)  This section applies to a program tenancy in any of the following types of federally subsidized project:

      (1) An insured or non-insured Section 236 project;

      (2) A Section 202 project;

      (3) A Section 221(d)(3) below market interest rate (BMIR) project; or

      (4) A Section 515 project of the Rural Development Administration.

      (b)  The rent to owner is the subsidized rent as determined in accordance with requirements for the applicable federal program listed in paragraph (a) of this section. This determination is not subject to the prohibition against increasing the rent to owner during the initial lease term (see § 982.309).

      (b) —(1) The family must supply any information that the PHA or HUD determines is necessary in the administration of the program, including submission of required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status (as provided by 24 CFR part 5). “Information” includes any requested certification, release or other documentation.

      (2) The family must supply any information requested by the PHA or HUD for use in a regularly scheduled reexamination or interim reexamination of family income and composition in accordance with HUD requirements.

      (3) The family must disclose and verify social security numbers (as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title) and must sign and submit consent forms for obtaining information in accordance with part 5, subpart B, of this title.

      (4) Any information supplied by the family must be true and complete.

      (c)  The family is responsible for an HQS breach caused by the family as described in § 982.404(b).

      (d)  The family must allow the PHA to inspect the unit at reasonable times and after reasonable notice.

      (e)  The family may not commit any serious or repeated violation of the lease. Under 24 CFR 5.2005(c), an incident or incidents of actual or threatened domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking will not be construed as a serious or repeated lease violation by the victim, or threatened victim, of the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or as good cause to terminate the tenancy, occupancy rights, or assistance of the victim.

      (f)  The family must notify the PHA and the owner before the family moves out of the unit, or terminates the lease on notice to the owner. See § 982.354(d).

      (g)  The family must promptly give the PHA a copy of any owner eviction notice.

      (h) —(1) The family must use the assisted unit for residence by the family. The unit must be the family's only residence.

      (2) The composition of the assisted family residing in the unit must be approved by the PHA. The family must promptly inform the PHA of the birth, adoption or court-awarded custody of a child. The family must request PHA approval to add any other family member as an occupant of the unit. No other person [i.e., nobody but members of the assisted family] may reside in the unit (except for a foster child or live-in aide as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section).

      (3) The family must promptly notify the PHA if any family member no longer resides in the unit.

      (4) If the PHA has given approval, a foster child or a live-in-aide may reside in the unit. The PHA has the discretion to adopt reasonable policies concerning residence by a foster child or a live-in-aide, and defining when PHA consent may be given or denied.

      (5) Members of the household may engage in legal profitmaking activities in the unit, but only if such activities are incidental to primary use of the unit for residence by members of the family.

      (6) The family must not sublease or let the unit.

      (7) The family must not assign the lease or transfer the unit.

      (i)  The family must supply any information or certification requested by the PHA to verify that the family is living in the unit, or relating to family absence from the unit, including any PHA-requested information or certification on the purposes of family absences. The family must cooperate with the PHA for this purpose. The family must promptly notify the PHA of absence from the unit.

      (j)  The family must not own or have any interest in the unit.

      (k)  The members of the family must not commit fraud, bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with the programs.

      (l)  The members of the household may not engage in drug-related criminal activity or violent criminal activity or other criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises (see § 982.553). Under 24 CFR 5.2005(b)(2), criminal activity directly related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, engaged in by a member of a tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall not be cause for termination of tenancy, occupancy rights, or assistance of the victim, if the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant, as defined in 24 CFR 5.2003, is the victim.

      (m)  The members of the household must not abuse alcohol in a way that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.

      (n)  An assisted family, or members of the family, may not receive Section 8 tenant-based assistance while receiving another housing subsidy, for the same unit or for a different unit, under any duplicative (as determined by HUD or in accordance with HUD requirements) federal, State or local housing assistance program.

      § 982.552   PHA denial or termination of assistance for family.

#### § § 982.552

      (a)  (1) A PHA may deny assistance for an applicant or terminate assistance for a participant under the programs because of the family's action or failure to act as described in this section or § 982.553. The provisions of this section do not affect denial or termination of assistance for grounds other than action or failure to act by the family.

      (2) Denial of assistance for an applicant may include any or all of the following: denying listing on the PHA waiting list, denying or withdrawing a voucher, refusing to enter into a HAP contract or approve a lease, and refusing to process or provide assistance under portability procedures.

      (3) Termination of assistance for a participant may include any or all of the following: refusing to enter into a HAP contract or approve a lease, terminating housing assistance payments under an outstanding HAP contract, and refusing to process or provide assistance under portability procedures.

      (4) This section does not limit or affect exercise of the PHA rights and remedies against the owner under the HAP contract, including termination, suspension or reduction of housing assistance payments, or termination of the HAP contract.

      (b)  (1) For provisions on denial of admission and termination of assistance for illegal drug use, other criminal activity, and alcohol abuse that would threaten other residents, see § 982.553.

      (2) The PHA must terminate program assistance for a family evicted from housing assisted under the program for serious violation of the lease.

      (3) The PHA must deny admission to the program for an applicant, or terminate program assistance for a participant, if any member of the family fails to sign and submit consent forms for obtaining information in accordance with part 5, subparts B and F of this title.

      (4) The family must submit required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status. See part 5 of this title for a statement of circumstances in which the PHA must deny admission or terminate program assistance because a family member does not establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, and the applicable informal hearing procedures.

      (5) The PHA must deny or terminate assistance if any family member fails to meet the eligibility requirements concerning individuals enrolled at an institution of higher education as specified in 24 CFR 5.612.

      (6) The PHA must deny or terminate assistance based on the restrictions on net assets and property ownership when required by § 5.618 of this title.

      (c) —(1)  The PHA may at any time deny program assistance for an applicant, or terminate program assistance for a participant, for any of the following grounds:

      (i) If the family violates any family obligations under the program (see § 982.551). See § 982.553 concerning denial or termination of assistance for crime by family members.

      (ii) If any member of the family has been evicted from federally assisted housing in the last five years;

      (iii) If a PHA has ever terminated assistance under the program for any member of the family.

      (iv) If any member of the family has committed fraud, bribery, or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any Federal housing program (see also § 982.553(a)(1));

      (v) If the family currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.

      (vi) If the family has not reimbursed any PHA for amounts paid to an owner under a HAP contract for rent, damages to the unit, or other amounts owed by the family under the lease.

      (vii) If the family breaches an agreement with the PHA to pay amounts owed to a PHA, or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. (The PHA, at its discretion, may offer a family the opportunity to enter an agreement to pay amounts owed to a PHA or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. The PHA may prescribe the terms of the agreement.)

      (viii) If the family has engaged in or threatened abusive or violent behavior toward PHA personnel.

      (ix) If a welfare-to-work (WTW) family fails, willfully and persistently, to fulfill its obligations under the welfare-to-work voucher program.

      (x) If the family has been engaged in criminal activity or alcohol abuse as described in § 982.553.

      (2)  In determining whether to deny or terminate assistance because of action or failure to act by members of the family:

      (i) The PHA may consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.

      (ii) The PHA may impose, as a condition of continued assistance for other family members, a requirement that other family members who participated in or were culpable for the action or failure will not reside in the unit. The PHA may permit the other members of a participant family to continue receiving assistance.

      (iii) In determining whether to deny admission or terminate assistance for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661).

      § 982.553   Denial of admission and termination of assistance for criminals and alcohol abusers.

#### § § 982.553

      (a) —(1)  (i) The PHA  prohibit admission to the program of an applicant for three years from the date of eviction if a household member has been evicted from federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:

      (A) That the evicted household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or

      (B) That the circumstances leading to eviction no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).

      (ii) The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission if:

      (A) The PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug;

      (B) The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or

      (C) Any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.

      (2)  The PHA  establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In this screening of applicants, the PHA _must_ perform criminal history background checks necessary to determine whether any household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement in the State where the housing is located and in other States where the household members are known to have resided.

      (ii)  (A) The PHA  prohibit admission of a household to the program if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaged in, or has engaged in during a reasonable time before the admission:

      (1) Drug-related criminal activity;

      (2) Violent criminal activity;

      (3) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or persons residing in the immediate vicinity; or

      (4) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health or safety of the owner, property management staff, or persons performing a contract administration function or responsibility on behalf of the PHA (including a PHA employee or a PHA contractor, subcontractor or agent).

      (B) The PHA may establish a period before the admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in the activities specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section (“reasonable time”).

      (C) If the PHA previously denied admission to an applicant because a member of the household engaged in criminal activity, the PHA may reconsider the applicant if the PHA has sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in, such criminal activity during a reasonable period, as determined by the PHA, before the admission decision.

      (1) The PHA would have “sufficient evidence” if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which the PHA verified.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.

      (3)  The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (b) —(1)  (i) The PHA  establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that:

      (A) Any household member is currently engaged in any illegal use of a drug; or

      (B) A pattern of illegal use of a drug by any household member interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (ii) The PHA must immediately terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.

      (iii) The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any family member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in any drug-related criminal activity.

      (2)  The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any household member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in violent criminal activity.

      (3)  The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

      (c)  The PHA may terminate assistance for criminal activity by a household member as authorized in this section if the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the household member has engaged in the activity, regardless of whether the household member has been arrested or convicted for such activity.

      (d) —(1)  If a PHA proposes to deny admission for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must provide the subject of the record and the applicant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record, in the informal review process in accordance with § 982.554. (See part 5, subpart J for provision concerning access to criminal records.)

      (2)  If a PHA proposes to terminate assistance for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in accordance with § 982.555.

      (3)  The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.

      (e) The requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.

However, the standards in this section apply in place of standards related to sanitary facilities, food preparation and refuse disposal, and space and security. Since the SRO units will not house children, the standards at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R, applying to the PBC program, concerning lead-based paint, do not apply to SRO housing.

        (b)  (1) SRO housing is subject to the additional performance requirements in this paragraph (b).

        (2) Sanitary facilities, and space and security characteristics must meet local code standards for SRO housing. In the absence of applicable local code standards for SRO housing, the following standards apply:

        (i)  (A) At least one flush toilet that can be used in privacy, lavatory basin, and bathtub or shower, in proper operating condition, must be supplied for each six persons or fewer residing in the SRO housing.

        (B) If SRO units are leased only to males, flush urinals may be substituted for not more than one-half the required number of flush toilets. However, there must be at least one flush toilet in the building.

        (C) Every lavatory basin and bathtub or shower must be supplied at all times with an adequate quantity of hot and cold running water.

        (D) All of these facilities must be in proper operating condition, and must be adequate for personal cleanliness and the disposal of human waste. The facilities must utilize an approvable public or private disposal system.

        (E) Sanitary facilities must be reasonably accessible from a common hall or passageway to all persons sharing them. These facilities may not be located more than one floor above or below the SRO unit. Sanitary facilities may not be located below grade unless the SRO units are located on that level.

        (ii)  (A) No more than one person may reside in an SRO unit.

        (B) An SRO unit must contain at least one hundred ten square feet of floor space.

        (C) An SRO unit must contain at least four square feet of closet space for each resident (with an unobstructed height of at least five feet). If there is less closet space, space equal to the amount of the deficiency must be subtracted from the area of the habitable room space when determining the amount of floor space in the SRO unit. The SRO unit must contain at least one hundred ten square feet of remaining floor space after subtracting the amount of the deficiency in minimum closet space.

        (D) Exterior doors and windows accessible from outside an SRO unit must be lockable.

        (3)  (i) Access doors to an SRO unit must have locks for privacy in proper operating condition.

        (ii) An SRO unit must have immediate access to two or more approved means of exit, appropriately marked, leading to safe and open space at ground level, and any means of exit required by State and local law.

        (iii) The resident must be able to access an SRO unit without passing through any other unit.

        (4)  A sprinkler system that protects all major spaces, hard wired smoke detectors, and such other fire and safety improvements as State or local law may require must be installed in each building. The term “major spaces” means hallways, large common areas, and other areas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes.

        § 982.615   Shared housing: Occupancy.

#### § § 982.615

        (a)  An assisted family may reside in shared housing. In shared housing, an assisted family shares a unit with the other resident or residents of the unit. The unit may be a house or an apartment.

        (b)  (1) If approved by the PHA, a live-in aide may reside with the family to care for a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. See § 982.316 concerning occupancy by a live-in aide.

        (2) Other persons who are assisted under the tenant-based program, or other persons who are not assisted under the tenant-based program, may reside in a shared housing unit.

        (3) The owner of a shared housing unit may reside in the unit. A resident owner may enter into a HAP contract with the PHA. However, housing assistance may not be paid on behalf of an owner. An assisted person may not be related by blood or marriage to a resident owner.

        § 982.617   Shared housing: Rent and voucher housing assistance payment.

#### § § 982.617

        (a)  For shared housing, the term “pro-rata portion” means the ratio derived by dividing the number of bedrooms in the private space available for occupancy by a family by the total number of bedrooms in the unit. For example, for a family entitled to occupy three bedrooms in a five bedroom unit, the ratio would be 3/5.

        (b)  (1) The rent to owner for the family may not exceed the pro-rata portion of the reasonable rent for the shared housing dwelling unit.

        (2) The reasonable rent is determined in accordance with § 982.507.

#### § § 982.618

        (a)  The PHA may not give approval to reside in shared housing unless the entire unit, including the portion of the unit available for use by the assisted family under its lease, meets HQS.

        (b)  As defined in § 982.4, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 for housing assisted under the HCV program, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3). However, the HQS standards in this section apply in place of standards related to space and security in 24 CFR 5.703.

        (c)  The facilities available for the use of an assisted family in shared housing under the family's lease must include (whether in the family's private space or in the common space) a living room, sanitary facilities in accordance with the standards set in 24 CFR 5.703, and food preparation and refuse disposal facilities in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703.

        (d)  (1) The entire unit must provide adequate space and security for all its residents (whether assisted or unassisted).

      Cooperative

        § 982.619   Cooperative housing.

#### § § 982.619

        (a)  This section applies to rental assistance for a cooperative member residing in cooperative housing. However, this section does not apply to:

        (1) Assistance for a cooperative member under the homeownership option pursuant to §§ 982.625 through 982.641; or

        (2) Rental assistance for a family that leases a cooperative housing unit from a cooperative member (such rental assistance is not a special housing type, and is subject to requirements in other subparts of this part 982).

        (b)  (1) The reasonable rent for a cooperative unit is determined in accordance with § 982.507. For cooperative housing, the rent to owner is the monthly carrying charge under the occupancy agreement/lease between the member and the cooperative.

        (2) The carrying charge consists of the amount assessed to the member by the cooperative for occupancy of the housing. The carrying charge includes the member's share of the cooperative debt service, operating expenses, and necessary payments to cooperative reserve funds. However, the carrying charge does not include down-payments or other payments to purchase the cooperative unit, or to amortize a loan to the family for this purpose.

        (3) Gross rent is the carrying charge plus any utility allowance.

        (4) Adjustments are applied to the carrying charge as determined in accordance with this section.

        (5) The occupancy agreement/lease and other appropriate documents must provide that the monthly carrying charge is subject to Section 8 limitations on rent to owner.

        (c)  The amount of the housing assistance payment is determined in accordance with subpart K of this part.

        (d)  (1) During the term of the HAP contract between the PHA and the cooperative, the dwelling unit and premises must be maintained in accordance with the HQS. If the dwelling unit and premises are not maintained in accordance with the HQS, the PHA may exercise all available remedies, regardless of whether the family or the cooperative is responsible for such breach of the HQS. PHA remedies for breach of the HQS include recovery of overpayments, abatement or other reduction of housing assistance payments, termination of housing assistance payments and termination of the HAP contract.

        (2) The PHA may not make any housing assistance payments if the contract unit does not meet the HQS, unless any defect is corrected within the period specified by the PHA and the PHA verifies the correction. If a defect is life-threatening, the defect must be corrected within no more than 24 hours. For other defects, the defect must be corrected within the period specified by the PHA.

        (3) The family is responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:

        (i) The family fails to perform any maintenance for which the family is responsible in accordance with the terms of the cooperative occupancy agreement between the cooperative member and the cooperative;

        (ii) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the cooperative is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the cooperative member;

        (iii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the cooperative is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the cooperative member; or

        (iv) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear).

        (4) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS for which the family is responsible, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce such family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for violation of family obligations in accordance with § 982.552.

        (5) Section 982.404 does not apply to assistance for cooperative housing under this section.

        (e)  (1) If approved by the PHA, a live-in aide may reside with the family to care for a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. See § 982.316 concerning occupancy by a live-in aide.

        (2) If there is a live-in aide, the live-in aide must be counted in determining the family unit size.

        (2) The PHA must permit a family to lease a manufactured home and space with assistance under the program.

        (3) The PHA may provide assistance for a family that owns the manufactured home and leases only the space. The PHA is not required to provide such assistance under the program.

        (b)  (1) The HQS in § 982.621 always apply when assistance is provided to a family occupying a manufactured home (under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section).

        (2) Sections 982.622 to 982.624 only apply when assistance is provided to a manufactured home owner to lease a manufactured home space.

        (c)  (1) If approved by the PHA, a live-in aide may reside with the family to care for a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. See § 982.316 concerning occupancy by a live-in aide.

        (2) If there is a live-in aide, the live-in aide must be counted in determining the family unit size.

        § 982.621   Manufactured home space rental: Housing quality standards.

#### § § 982.621

        As defined in § 982.4, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 for housing assisted under the HCV program, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3).   A manufactured home also must meet the following requirements:

        (a)  A manufactured home must be placed on the site in a stable manner, and must be free from hazards such as sliding or wind damage.

        (b)  A manufactured home must be securely anchored by a tie-down device that distributes and transfers the loads imposed by the unit to appropriate ground anchors to resist wind overturning and sliding.

      Manufactured Home Space Rental

        § 982.622   Manufactured home space rental: Rent to owner.

#### § § 982.622

        (a)  (1) Rent to owner for rental of a manufactured home space includes payment for maintenance and services that the owner must provide to the tenant under the lease for the space.

        (2) Rent to owner does not include the costs of utilities and trash collection for the manufactured home. However, the owner may charge the family a separate fee for the cost of utilities or trash collection provided by the owner.

        (b)  (1) During the assisted tenancy, the rent to owner for the manufactured home space may not exceed a reasonable rent as determined in accordance with this section. Section 982.503 is not applicable.

        (2) The PHA may not approve a lease for a manufactured home space until the PHA determines that the initial rent to owner for the space is a reasonable rent. At least annually during the assisted tenancy, the PHA must redetermine that the current rent to owner is a reasonable rent.

        (3) The PHA must determine whether the rent to owner for the manufactured home space is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable manufactured home spaces. To make this determination, the PHA must consider the location and size of the space, and any services and maintenance to be provided by the owner in accordance with the lease (without a fee in addition to the rent).

        (4) By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner of the manufactured home space certifies that the rent to owner for the space is not more than rent charged by the owner for unassisted rental of comparable spaces in the same manufactured home park or elsewhere. The owner must give the PHA information, as requested by the PHA, on rents charged by the owner for other manufactured home spaces.

        § 982.623   Manufactured home space rental: Housing assistance payment.

#### § § 982.623

        (a)  The monthly housing assistance payment is calculated as the lower of:

        (1) The PHA payment standard, determined in accordance with § 982.503 minus the total tenant payment; or

        (2) The family's eligible housing expenses minus the total tenant payment.

        (b)  The family's eligible housing expenses are the total of:

        (1) The rent charged by the owner for the manufactured home space.

        (2) Charges for the maintenance and management the space owner must provide under the lease.

        (3) The monthly payments made by the family to amortize the cost of purchasing the manufactured home established at the time of application to a lender for financing the purchase of the manufactured home if monthly payments are still being made, including any required insurance and property taxes included in the loan payment to the lender.

        (i) Any increase in debt service or term due to refinancing after purchase of the home may not be included in the amortization cost.

        (ii) Debt service for installation charges incurred by a family may be included in the monthly amortization payments. Installation charges incurred before the family became an assisted family may be included in the amortization cost if monthly payments are still being made to amortize the charges.

        (4) The applicable allowances for tenant-paid utilities, as determined under §§ 982.517 and 982.624.

        (c)  In general, the monthly housing assistance payment is distributed as follows:

        (1) The PHA pays the owner of the space the lesser of the housing assistance payment or the portion of the monthly rent due to the owner. The portion of the monthly rent due to the owner is the total of:

        (i) The actual rent charged by the owner for the manufactured home space; and

        (ii) Charges for the maintenance and management the space owner must provide under the lease.

        (2) If the housing assistance payment exceeds the portion of the monthly rent due to the owner, the PHA may pay the balance of the housing assistance payment to the family. Alternatively, the PHA may pay the balance to the lender or utility company, in an amount no greater than the amount due for the month to each, respectively, subject to the lender's or utility company's willingness to accept the PHA's payment on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the lender or the utility company directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the lender or the utility company and must pay any remaining balance directly to the family.

        (d)  (1) If the owner of the manufactured home space agrees, the PHA may make the entire housing assistance payment to the family, and the family shall be responsible for paying the owner directly for the full amount of rent of the manufactured home space due to the owner, including owner maintenance and management charges. If the PHA exercises this option, the PHA may not make any payments directly to the lender or utility company.

        (2) The PHA and owner of the manufactured home space must still execute the HAP contract, and the owner is still responsible for fulfilling all of the owner obligations under the HAP contract, including but not limited to complying with HQS and rent reasonableness requirements. The owner's acceptance of the family's monthly rent payment during the term of the HAP contract serves as the owner's certification to the reasonableness of the rent charged for the space in accordance with § 982.622(b)(4).

        (3) If the family and owner agree to the single housing assistance payment, the owner is responsible for collecting the full amount of the rent and other charges under the lease directly from the family. The PHA is not responsible for any amounts owed by the family to the owner and may not pay any claim by the owner against the family.

> [89 FR 38303, May 7, 2024]

        § 982.624   Manufactured home space rental: Utility allowance schedule.

#### § § 982.624

        The PHA must establish utility allowances for manufactured home space rental. For the first twelve months of the initial lease term only, the allowances must include a reasonable amount for utility hook-up charges payable by the family if the family actually incurs the expenses because of a move. Allowances for utility hook-up charges do not apply to a family that leases a manufactured home space in place. Utility allowances for manufactured home space must not cover costs payable by a family to cover the digging of a well or installation of a septic system.

        (2) It is the sole responsibility of the PHA to determine whether it is reasonable to implement a homeownership program as a reasonable accommodation. The PHA will determine what is reasonable based on the specific circumstances and individual needs of the person with a disability. The PHA may determine that it is not reasonable to offer homeownership assistance as a reasonable accommodation in cases where the PHA has otherwise opted not to implement a homeownership program.

        (e)  (1) The family chooses whether to participate in the homeownership option if offered by the PHA.

        (2) If the PHA offers both forms of homeownership assistance, the family chooses which form of homeownership assistance to receive.

        (g)  The PHA must have the capacity to operate a successful Section 8 homeownership program. The PHA has the required capacity if it satisfies either paragraph (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3) of this section.

        (1) The PHA establishes a minimum homeowner downpayment requirement of at least 3 percent of the purchase price for participation in its Section 8 homeownership program, and requires that at least one percent of the purchase price come from the family's personal resources;

        (2) The PHA requires that financing for purchase of a home under its Section 8 homeownership program:

        (i) Be provided, insured, or guaranteed by the state or Federal government;

        (ii) Comply with secondary mortgage market underwriting requirements; or

        (iii) Comply with generally accepted private sector underwriting standards; or

        (3) The PHA otherwise demonstrates in its Annual Plan that it has the capacity, or will acquire the capacity, to successfully operate a Section 8 homeownership program.

        (h)  A PHA shall not impose or enforce any requirement for the recapture of voucher homeownership assistance on the sale or refinancing of a home purchased with assistance under the homeownership option.

        (x) Section 982.638 (Denial or termination of assistance for family); and

        (xi) Section 982.641 (Applicability of other requirements).

        (2)  The following provisions only apply to homeownership assistance in the form of monthly homeownership assistance payments:

Any such limits or additional requirements must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

        (c)  The PHA is responsible for complying with the authorities listed in § 58.6 of this title requiring the purchaser to obtain and maintain flood insurance for units in special flood hazard areas, prohibiting assistance for acquiring units in the coastal barrier resources system, and requiring notification to the purchaser of units in airport runway clear zones and airfield clear zones. In the case of units not yet under construction at the time the family enters into the contract for sale, the additional environmental review requirements referenced in § 982.628(e) of this part also apply, and the PHA shall submit all relevant environmental information to the responsible entity or to HUD to assist in completion of those requirements.

        § 982.627   Homeownership option: Eligibility requirements for families.

#### § § 982.627

        (a)  The PHA may not provide homeownership assistance for a family unless the PHA determines that the family satisfies all of the following initial requirements at commencement of homeownership assistance for the family:

        (1) The family has been admitted to the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, in accordance with subpart E of this part.

        (2) The family satisfies any first-time homeowner requirements (described in paragraph (b) of this section).

        (3) The family satisfies the minimum income requirement (described in paragraph (c) of this section).

        (4) The family satisfies the employment requirements (described in paragraph (d) of this section).

        (5) The family has not defaulted on a mortgage securing debt to purchase a home under the homeownership option (see paragraph (e) of this section).

        (6) Except for cooperative members who have acquired cooperative membership shares prior to commencement of homeownership assistance, no family member has a present ownership interest in a residence at the commencement of homeownership assistance for the purchase of any home.

        (7) Except for cooperative members who have acquired cooperative membership shares prior to the commencement of homeownership assistance, the family has entered a contract of sale in accordance with § 982.631(c).

        (8) The family also satisfies any other initial requirements established by the PHA (see § 982.626(b)). Any such additional requirements must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

        (b)  At commencement of homeownership assistance for the family, the family must be any of the following:

        (1) A first-time homeowner (defined at § 982.4);

        (2) A cooperative member (defined at § 982.4); or

        (3) A family of which a family member is a person with disabilities, and use of the homeownership option is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by such person, in accordance with part 8 of this title.

        (c)  (1) At commencement of monthly homeownership assistance payments for the family, or at the time of a downpayment assistance grant for the family, the family must demonstrate that the annual income, as determined by the PHA in accordance with § 5.609 of this title, of the adult family members who will own the home at commencement of homeownership assistance is not less than:

        (i) In the case of a disabled family (as defined in § 5.403(b) of this title), the monthly Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit for an individual living alone (or paying his or her share of food and housing costs) multiplied by twelve; or

        (ii) In the case of other families, the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 2,000 hours.

        (2)(i) Except in the case of an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title), the PHA shall not count any welfare assistance received by the family in determining annual income under this section.

        (ii) The disregard of welfare assistance income under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section only affects the determination of minimum annual income used to determine if a family initially qualifies for commencement of homeownership assistance in accordance with this section, but does not affect:

        (A) The determination of income-eligibility for admission to the voucher program;

        (B) Calculation of the amount of the family's total tenant payment (gross family contribution); or

        (C) Calculation of the amount of homeownership assistance payments on behalf of the family.

        (iii) In the case of an elderly or disabled family, the PHA shall include welfare assistance for the adult family members who will own the home in determining if the family meets the minimum income requirement.

        (3) A PHA may establish a minimum income standard that is higher than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for either or both types of families. However, a family that meets the applicable HUD minimum income requirement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but not the higher standard established by the PHA shall be considered to satisfy the minimum income requirement if:

        (i) The family demonstrates that it has been pre-qualified or pre-approved for financing;

        (ii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing meets any PHA established requirements under § 982.632 for financing the purchase of the home (including qualifications of lenders and terms of financing); and

        (iii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing amount is sufficient to purchase housing that meets HQS in the PHA's jurisdiction.

        (d)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the family must demonstrate that one or more adult members of the family who will own the home at commencement of homeownership assistance:

        (i) Is currently employed on a full-time basis (the term “full-time employment” means not less than an average of 30 hours per week); and

        (ii) Has been continuously so employed during the year before commencement of homeownership assistance for the family.

        (2) The PHA shall have discretion to determine whether and to what extent interruptions are considered to break continuity of employment during the year. The PHA may count successive employment during the year. The PHA may count self-employment in a business.

        (3) The employment requirement does not apply to an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title). Furthermore, if a family, other than an elderly family or a disabled family, includes a person with disabilities, the PHA shall grant an exemption from the employment requirement if the PHA determines that an exemption is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title.

        (4) A PHA may not establish an employment requirement in addition to the employment standard established by this paragraph.

        (e)  The PHA shall not commence homeownership assistance for a family that includes an individual who was an adult member of a family at the time when such family received homeownership assistance and defaulted on a mortgage securing debt incurred to purchase the home.

        § 982.631   Homeownership option: Home inspections, contract of sale, and PHA disapproval of seller.

#### § § 982.631

        (a) HQS inspection by PHA. The PHA may not commence monthly homeownership assistance payments or provide a downpayment assistance grant for the family until the PHA has inspected the unit and has determined that the unit passes HQS.

        (b)  (1) The unit must also be inspected by an independent professional inspector selected by and paid by the family.

        (2) The independent inspection must cover major building systems and components, including foundation and structure, housing interior and exterior, and the roofing, plumbing, electrical, and heating systems. The independent inspector must be qualified to report on property conditions, including major building systems and components.

        (3) The PHA may not require the family to use an independent inspector selected by the PHA. The independent inspector may not be a PHA employee or contractor, or other person under control of the PHA. However, the PHA may establish standards for qualification of inspectors selected by families under the homeownership option.

        (4) The independent inspector must provide a copy of the inspection report both to the family and to the PHA. The PHA may not commence monthly homeownership assistance payments, or provide a downpayment assistance grant for the family, until the PHA has reviewed the inspection report of the independent inspector. Even if the unit otherwise complies with the HQS (and may qualify for assistance under the PHA's tenant-based rental voucher program), the PHA shall have discretion to disapprove the unit for assistance under the homeownership option because of information in the inspection report.

        (c)  (1) Before commencement of monthly homeownership assistance payments or receipt of a downpayment assistance grant, a member or members of the family must enter into a contract of sale with the seller of the unit to be acquired by the family. The family must give the PHA a copy of the contract of sale (see also § 982.627(a)(7)).

        (2) The contract of sale must:

        (i) Specify the price and other terms of sale by the seller to the purchaser.

        (ii) Provide that the purchaser will arrange for a pre-purchase inspection of the dwelling unit by an independent inspector selected by the purchaser.

        (iii) Provide that the purchaser is not obligated to purchase the unit unless the inspection is satisfactory to the purchaser.

        (iv) Provide that the purchaser is not obligated to pay for any necessary repairs.

        (3) In addition to the requirements contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a contract for the sale of units not yet under construction at the time the family is to enter into the contract for sale must also provide that:

        (i) The purchaser is not obligated to purchase the unit unless an environmental review has been performed and the site has received environmental approval prior to commencement of construction in accordance with 24 CFR 982.628.

        (ii) The construction will not commence until the environmental review has been completed and the seller has received written notice from the PHA that environmental approval has been obtained. Conduct of the environmental review may not necessarily result in environmental approval, and environmental approval may be conditioned on the contracting parties' agreement to modifications to the unit design or to mitigation actions.

        (iii) Commencement of construction in violation of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section voids the purchase contract and renders homeownership assistance under 24 CFR part 982 unavailable for purchase of the unit.

        (d)  In its administrative discretion, the PHA may deny approval of a seller for any reason provided for disapproval of an owner in § 982.306(c).

> [65 FR 55163, Sept. 12, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 64494, Oct. 18, 2002; 72 FR 59938, Oct. 22, 2007; 72 FR 73497, Dec. 27, 2007; 80 FR 8247, Feb. 17, 2015]

        § 982.632   Homeownership option: Financing purchase of home; affordability of purchase.

#### § § 982.632

        (a) The PHA may establish requirements for financing purchase of a home to be assisted under the homeownership option. Such PHA requirements may include requirements concerning qualification of lenders (for example, prohibition of seller financing or case-by-case approval of seller financing), or concerning terms of financing (for example, a prohibition of balloon payment mortgages, establishment of a minimum homeowner equity requirement from personal resources, or provisions required to protect borrowers against high cost loans or predatory loans). A PHA may not require that families acquire financing from one or more specified lenders, thereby restricting the family's ability to secure favorable financing terms.

        (b) If the purchase of the home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements.

        (c) The PHA may establish requirements or other restrictions concerning debt secured by the home.

        (d) The PHA may review lender qualifications and the loan terms before authorizing homeownership assistance. The PHA may disapprove proposed financing, refinancing or other debt if the PHA determines that the debt is unaffordable, or if the PHA determines that the lender or the loan terms do not meet PHA qualifications. In making this determination, the PHA may take into account other family expenses, such as child care, unreimbursed medical expenses, homeownership expenses, and other family expenses as determined by the PHA.

        (e) All PHA financing or affordability requirements must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

#### § § 982.633

        (a)  Homeownership assistance may only be paid while the family is residing in the home. If the family moves out of the home, the PHA may not continue homeownership assistance after the month when the family moves out. The family or lender is not required to refund to the PHA the homeownership assistance for the month when the family moves out.

        (b)  The family must comply with the following obligations.

        (1)  To the extent required by the PHA, the family must attend and complete ongoing homeownership and housing counseling.

        (2)  The family must comply with the terms of any mortgage securing debt incurred to purchase the home (or any refinancing of such debt).

        (3)  (i) So long as the family is receiving homeownership assistance, use and occupancy of the home is subject to § 982.551(h) and (i).

        (ii) The family may grant a mortgage on the home for debt incurred to finance purchase of the home or any refinancing of such debt.

        (iii) Upon death of a family member who holds, in whole or in part, title to the home or ownership of cooperative membership shares for the home, homeownership assistance may continue pending settlement of the decedent's estate, notwithstanding transfer of title by operation of law to the decedent's executor or legal representative, so long as the home is solely occupied by remaining family members in accordance with § 982.551(h).

        (4)  (i) The family must supply required information to the PHA in accordance with § 982.551(b).

        (ii) In addition to other required information, the family must supply any information as required by the PHA or HUD concerning:

        (A) Any mortgage or other debt incurred to purchase the home, and any refinancing of such debt (including information needed to determine whether the family has defaulted on the debt, and the nature of any such default), and information on any satisfaction or payment of the mortgage debt;

        (B) Any sale or other transfer of any interest in the home; or

        (C) The family's homeownership expenses.

        (5)  The family must notify the PHA before the family moves out of the home.

        (6)  The family must notify the PHA if the family defaults on a mortgage securing any debt incurred to purchase the home.

        (7)  During the time the family receives homeownership assistance under this subpart, no family member may have any ownership interest in any other residential property.

        (8)  The PHA may establish additional requirements for continuation of homeownership assistance for the family (for example, a requirement for post-purchase homeownership counseling or for periodic unit inspections while the family is receiving homeownership assistance). The family must comply with any such requirements.

        (9)  The family must comply with the obligations of a participant family described in § 982.551. However, the following provisions do not apply to assistance under the homeownership option: § 982.551(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (j).

        (c)  Before commencement of homeownership assistance, the family must execute a statement of family obligations in the form prescribed by HUD. In the statement, the family agrees to comply with all family obligations under the homeownership option.

        § 982.634   Homeownership option: Maximum term of homeownership assistance.

#### § § 982.634

        (a)  Except in the case of a family that qualifies as an elderly or disabled family (see paragraph (c) of this section), the family members described in paragraph (b) of this section shall not receive homeownership assistance for more than:

        (1) Fifteen years, if the initial mortgage incurred to finance purchase of the home has a term of 20 years or longer; or

        (2) Ten years, in all other cases.

        (b)  The maximum term described in paragraph (a) of this section applies to any member of the family who:

        (1) Has an ownership interest in the unit during the time that homeownership payments are made; or

        (2) Is the spouse of any member of the household who has an ownership interest in the unit during the time homeownership payments are made.

        (c)  (1) As noted in paragraph (a) of this section, the maximum term of assistance does not apply to elderly and disabled families.

        (2) In the case of an elderly family, the exception only applies if the family qualifies as an elderly family at the start of homeownership assistance. In the case of a disabled family, the exception applies if at any time during receipt of homeownership assistance the family qualifies as a disabled family.

        (3) If, during the course of homeownership assistance, the family ceases to qualify as a disabled or elderly family, the maximum term becomes applicable from the date homeownership assistance commenced. However, such a family must be provided at least 6 months of homeownership assistance after the maximum term becomes applicable (provided the family is otherwise eligible to receive homeownership assistance in accordance with this part).

        (d)  If the family has received such assistance for different homes, or from different PHAs, the total of such assistance terms is subject to the maximum term described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 982.635   Homeownership option: Amount and distribution of monthly homeownership assistance payment.

#### § § 982.635

        (a)  While the family is residing in the home, the PHA shall pay a monthly homeownership assistance payment on behalf of the family that is equal to the

        (1) The payment standard minus the total tenant payment; or

        (2) The family's monthly homeownership expenses minus the total tenant payment.

        (b)  (1) The payment standard for a family is the lower of:

        (i) The payment standard for the family unit size; or

        (ii) The payment standard for the size of the home.

        (2) If the home is located in an exception payment standard area, the PHA must use the appropriate payment standard for the exception payment standard area.

        (3) The payment standard amount may not be lower than what the payment standard amount was at commencement of homeownership assistance.

        (4) The PHA must use the same payment standard schedule, payment standard amounts, and subsidy standards pursuant to §§ 982.402 and 982.503 for the homeownership option as for the rental voucher program.

        (c)  (1) The PHA shall adopt policies for determining the amount of homeownership expenses to be allowed by the PHA in accordance with HUD requirements.

        (2) Homeownership expenses for a homeowner (other than a cooperative member) may only include amounts allowed by the PHA to cover:

        (i) Principal and interest on initial mortgage debt, any refinancing of such debt, and any mortgage insurance premium incurred to finance purchase of the home;

        (ii) Real estate taxes and public assessments on the home;

        (iii) Home insurance;

        (iv) The PHA allowance for maintenance expenses;

        (vi) The PHA utility allowance for the home;

        (vii) Principal and interest on mortgage debt incurred to finance costs for major repairs, replacements or improvements for the home. If a member of the family is a person with disabilities, such debt may include debt incurred by the family to finance costs needed to make the home accessible for such person, if the PHA determines that allowance of such costs as homeownership expenses is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the homeownership option is readily accessible to and usable by such person, in accordance with parts 8 and 100 of this title; and

        (viii) Land lease payments (where a family does not own fee title to the real property on which the home is located; see § 982.628(b)).

        (3) Homeownership expenses for a cooperative member may only include amounts allowed by the PHA to cover:

If a member of the family is a person with disabilities, such debt may include debt incurred by the family to finance costs needed to make the home accessible for such person, if the PHA determines that allowance of such costs as homeownership expenses is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the homeownership option is readily accessible to and usable by such person, in accordance with parts 8 and 100 of this title.

        (4) If the home is a cooperative or condominium unit, homeownership expenses may also include cooperative or condominium operating charges or maintenance fees assessed by the condominium or cooperative homeowner association.

        (d)  The PHA must pay homeownership assistance payments either:

        (1) Directly to the family or;

        (2) At the discretion of the PHA, to a lender on behalf of the family. If the assistance payment exceeds the amount due to the lender, the PHA must pay the excess directly to the family.

        (e)  Homeownership assistance for a family terminates automatically 180 calendar days after the last homeownership assistance payment on behalf of the family. However, a PHA has the discretion to grant relief from this requirement in those cases where automatic termination would result in extreme hardship for the family.

        (b)  Subject to § 982.353(b) and (c), § 982.552, and § 982.553, a family determined eligible for homeownership assistance by the initial PHA may purchase a unit outside of the initial PHA's jurisdiction, if the receiving PHA is administering a voucher homeownership program and is accepting new homeownership families.

        (c)  In general, the portability procedures described in §§ 982.353 and 982.355 apply to the homeownership option and the administrative responsibilities of the initial and receiving PHA are not altered except that some administrative functions (e.g., issuance of a voucher or execution of a tenancy addendum) do not apply to the homeownership option.

        (d)  The family must attend the briefing and counseling sessions required by the receiving PHA. The receiving PHA will determine whether the financing for, and the physical condition of the unit, are acceptable.

#### § § 982.637

        (a)  (1) A family receiving homeownership assistance may move to a new unit with continued tenant-based assistance in accordance with this section. The family may move either with voucher rental assistance (in accordance with rental assistance program requirements) or with voucher homeownership assistance (in accordance with homeownership option program requirements).

        (2) The PHA may not commence continued tenant-based assistance for occupancy of the new unit so long as any family member owns any title or other interest in the prior home. However, when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member (or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move), such family or family member may be assisted with continued tenant-based assistance even if such family or family member owns any title or other interest in the prior home.

        (3) The PHA may establish policies that prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period. However, these policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.

        (b)  The PHA must determine that all initial requirements listed in § 982.626 (including the environmental requirements with respect to a unit not yet under construction) have been satisfied if a family that has received homeownership assistance wants to move to such a unit with continued homeownership assistance. However, the following requirements do not apply:

        (1) The requirement for pre-assistance counseling (§ 982.630) is not applicable. However, the PHA may require that the family complete additional counseling (before or after moving to a new unit with continued assistance under the homeownership option).

        (2) The requirement that a family must be a first-time homeowner (§ 982.627) is not applicable.

        (c)  The PHA may deny permission to move to a new unit with continued voucher assistance as follows:

        (1)  The PHA may deny permission to move with continued rental or homeownership assistance if the PHA determines that it does not have sufficient funding to provide continued assistance. The PHA must provide written notification to the local HUD Office within 10 business days of determining it is necessary to deny moves based on insufficient funding.

        (2)  At any time, the PHA may deny permission to move with continued rental or homeownership assistance in accordance with § 982.638.

        § 982.638   Homeownership option: Denial or termination of assistance for family.

#### § § 982.638

        (a)  The PHA shall terminate homeownership assistance for the family, and shall deny voucher rental assistance for the family, in accordance with this section.

        (b)  At any time, the PHA may deny or terminate homeownership assistance in accordance with § 982.552 (Grounds for denial or termination of assistance) or § 982.553 (Crime by family members).

        (c)  The PHA may deny or terminate assistance for violation of participant obligations described in § 982.551 or § 982.633.

        (d)  The PHA must terminate voucher homeownership assistance for any member of family receiving homeownership assistance that is dispossessed from the home pursuant to a judgment or order of foreclosure on any mortgage (whether FHA-insured or non-FHA) securing debt incurred to purchase the home, or any refinancing of such debt. The PHA, in its discretion, may permit the family to move to a new unit with continued voucher rental assistance. However, the PHA must deny such permission, if:

        (1) The family defaulted on an FHA-insured mortgage; and

        (2) The family fails to demonstrate that:

        (i) The family has conveyed, or will convey, title to the home, as required by HUD, to HUD or HUD's designee; and

        (ii) The family has moved, or will move, from the home within the period established or approved by HUD.

        § 982.642   Homeownership option: Pilot program for homeownership assistance for disabled families.

#### § § 982.642

        (a)  This section implements the pilot program authorized by section 302 of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000. Under the pilot program, a PHA may provide homeownership assistance to a disabled family residing in a home purchased and owned by one or more members of the family. A PHA that administers tenant-based assistance has the choice whether to offer homeownership assistance under the pilot program (whether or not the PHA has also decided to offer the homeownership option).

        (b)  Except as provided in this section, all of the regulations applicable to the homeownership option (as described in §§ 982.625 through 982.641) are also applicable to the pilot program.

        (c)  Before commencing homeownership assistance under the pilot program for a family, the PHA must determine that all of the following initial requirements have been satisfied:

        (1) The family is a disabled family (as defined in § 5.403 of this title);

        (2) The family annual income does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area;

        (3) The family is not a current homeowner;

        (4) The family must close on the purchase of the home during the period starting on July 23, 2001 and ending on July 23, 2004; and

        (5) The family meets the initial requirements described in § 982.626; however, the following initial requirements do not apply to a family seeking to participate in the pilot program:

        (i) The income eligibility requirements of § 982.201(b)(1);

        (ii) The first-time homeowner requirements of § 982.627(b); and

        (iii) The mortgage default requirements of § 982.627(e), if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency.

        (d)  (1) While the family is residing in the home, the PHA shall calculate a monthly homeownership assistance payment on behalf of the family in accordance with § 982.635 and this section.

        (2) A family that is a low income family (as defined at 24 CFR 5.603(b)) as determined by HUD shall receive the full amount of the monthly homeownership assistance payment calculated under § 982.635.

        (3) A family whose annual income is greater than the low income family ceiling but does not exceed 89 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 66 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.

        (4) A family whose annual income is greater than the 89 percent ceiling but does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 33 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.

        (5) A family whose annual income is greater than 99 percent of the median income for the area shall not receive homeownership assistance under the pilot program.

        (e)  The PHA must make homeownership assistance payments to a lender on behalf of the disabled family. If the assistance payment exceeds the amount due to the lender, the PHA must pay the excess directly to the family. The provisions of § 982.635(d), which permit the PHA to make monthly homeownership assistance payments directly to the family, do not apply to the pilot program.

        (f)  The requirements of § 982.638(d) regarding mortgage defaults are applicable to the pilot program. However, notwithstanding § 982.638(d), the PHA may, in its discretion, permit a family that has defaulted on its mortgage to move to a new unit with continued voucher homeownership assistance if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency. The requirements of §§ 982.627(a)(5) and 982.627(e) do not apply to such a family.

        § 982.643   Homeownership option: Downpayment assistance grants.

#### § § 982.643

        (a)  (1) A PHA may provide a single downpayment assistance grant for a participant that has received tenant-based or project-based rental assistance in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

        (2) The downpayment assistance grant must be applied toward the downpayment required in connection with the purchase of the home and/or reasonable and customary closing costs in connection with the purchase of the home.

        (3) If the PHA permits the downpayment grant to be applied to closing costs, the PHA must define what fees and charges constitute reasonable and customary closing costs. However, if the purchase of a home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements, including any requirements concerning closing costs (see § 982.632(b) of this part regarding the applicability of FHA requirements to voucher homeownership assistance and § 203.27 of this title regarding allowable fees, charges and discounts for FHA-insured mortgages).

        (b)  A downpayment assistance grant may not exceed twelve times the difference between the payment standard and the total tenant payment.

        (c)  The downpayment assistance grant shall be paid at the closing of the family's purchase of the home.

        (d)  For each downpayment assistance grant made by the PHA, HUD will pay the PHA a one-time administrative fee in accordance with § 982.152(a)(1)(iii).

        (e)  A family that has received a downpayment assistance grant may apply for and receive tenant-based rental assistance, in accordance with program requirements and PHA policies. However, the PHA may not commence tenant-based rental assistance for occupancy of the new unit so long as any member of the family owns any title or other interest in the home purchased with homeownership assistance. Further, eighteen months must have passed since the family's receipt of the downpayment assistance grant.

        (f)  A PHA may not offer downpayment assistance under this paragraph until HUD publishes a notice in the

      § 982.601   Overview.

#### § § 982.601

      (a)  This subpart describes program requirements for special housing types. The following are the special housing types:

      (3) Group home;

      (4) Shared housing;

      (b)  (1) The PHA may permit a family to use any of the following special housing types in accordance with requirements of the program: single room occupancy (SRO) housing, congregate housing, group home, shared housing, manufactured home when the family owns the home and leases the manufactured home space, cooperative housing or homeownership option.

      (2) In general, the PHA is not required to permit families (including families that move into the PHA program under portability procedures) to use any of these special housing types, and may limit the number of families using special housing types.

      (3) The PHA must permit use of any special housing type if needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 8.

      (4) For occupancy of a manufactured home, see § 982.620(a).

      (c)  (1) HUD does not provide any additional or designated funding for special housing types, or for a specific special housing type (e.g., the homeownership option). Assistance for special housing types is paid from program funding available for the PHA's tenant-based program under the consolidated annual contributions contract.

      (2) The PHA may not set aside program funding or program slots for special housing types or for a specific special housing type.

      (d)  The family chooses whether to use housing that qualifies as a special housing type under this subpart, or as any specific special housing type, or to use other eligible housing in accordance with requirements of the program. The PHA may not restrict the family's freedom to choose among available units in accordance with § 982.353.

      (e)  (1) Except as modified by this subpart, the requirements of other subparts of this part apply to the special housing types.

      (2) Provisions in this subpart only apply to a specific special housing type. The housing type is noted in the title of each section.

      (3) Housing must meet the requirements of this subpart for a single special housing type specified by the family. Such housing is not subject to requirements for other special housing types. A single unit cannot be designated as more than one special housing type.

      The point when the family becomes a participant in the PHA's tenant-based or project-based voucher program. If the family is not already a tenant-based voucher participant, the date of admission for the project-based voucher program is the first day of the initial lease term (the commencement of the assisted tenancy) in the PBV unit. After admission, and so long as the family is continuously assisted with tenant-based or project-based voucher assistance from the PHA, a shift from tenant-based or project-based assistance to the other form of voucher assistance is not a new admission.

      A written contract between the PHA and the owner in the form prescribed by HUD. The Agreement defines requirements for development activity undertaken for units to be assisted under this section. When development is completed by the owner in accordance with the Agreement, the PHA enters into a HAP contract with the owner. The Agreement is not used for existing housing assisted under this section.

      A family that has applied for admission to the PBV program but is not yet a program participant.

      An area where a voucher is difficult to use is:

      (i) A census tract with a poverty rate of 20 percent or less, as determined by HUD;

      (ii) A ZIP code area where the rental vacancy rate is less than 4 percent, as determined by HUD; or

      (iii) A ZIP code area where 90 percent of the Small Area FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan area or county FMR.

      A residence facility (including a facility located in a larger multifamily property) that meets all the following criteria:

      (i) The facility is licensed and regulated as an assisted living facility by the State, municipality, or other political subdivision;

      (ii) The facility makes available supportive services to assist residents in carrying out activities of daily living; and

      (iii) The facility provides separate dwelling units for residents and includes common rooms and other facilities appropriate and available to provide supportive services for the residents.

      (i) All the proposed contract units in the project either fully comply or substantially comply with HQS on the proposal or project selection date, as determined per § 983.103(a). (The units must fully comply with HQS at the time required by § 983.103(c)). The units substantially comply with HQS if:

      (A) The units only require repairs to current components or replacement of equipment and/or materials by items of substantially the same kind to correct deficiencies; and

      (B) The PHA determines all deficiencies can reasonably be corrected within a 30-day period, taking into consideration the totality of the deficiencies in the project.

      (ii) The PHA determines the project is not reasonably expected to require substantial improvement and the owner certifies it has no plans to undertake substantial improvement from the proposal submission date (for projects subject to competitive selection) or the project selection date (for projects excepted from competitive selection) through the first two years of the HAP contract.

      § 983.5   Description of the PBV program.

#### § § 983.5

      (a)  (1) The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under the consolidated annual contributions contract (ACC) in 24 CFR 982.151. In the PBV program, the assistance is “attached to the structure,” which may be a multifamily building or single-family building. (See description of the difference between “project-based” and “tenant-based” rental assistance at 24 CFR 982.1(b)).

      (2) The PHA enters into a HAP contract with an owner for units in existing housing or in newly constructed or rehabilitated housing.

      (3) In the case of new construction or rehabilitation, the owner may develop the housing pursuant to an Agreement (§ 983.154) between the owner and the PHA. In the Agreement, the PHA agrees to execute a HAP contract after the owner completes the construction or rehabilitation of the units. Alternatively:

      (i) The owner may develop the housing without an Agreement, before execution of a HAP contract, in accordance with § 983.154(f); or

      (ii) In the case of rehabilitation, the owner may develop the housing or complete development activity after execution of the HAP contract, in accordance with § 983.157.

      (4) During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA makes housing assistance payments to the owner for units leased and occupied by eligible families.

      (b)  If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC. This funding is used to pay housing assistance for both tenant-based and project-based voucher units. Likewise, the administrative fee funding made available to a PHA is used for the administration of both tenant-based and project-based voucher assistance.

      (c)  A PHA has discretion whether to operate a PBV program. HUD approval is not required, except that the PHA must notify HUD of its intent to project-base its vouchers and when the PHA executes, amends, or extends a HAP contract. The PHA must also state in its Administrative Plan that it will engage in project-basing and must amend its Administrative Plan to include all PBV-related matters over which the PHA is exercising its policymaking discretion, including the subjects listed in § 983.10, as applicable.

> [89 FR 38306, May 7, 2024]

      § 983.6   Maximum number of PBV units (percentage limitation).

#### § § 983.6

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a PHA may commit project-based assistance to no more than 20 percent of its authorized voucher units, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, at the time of commitment. An analysis of impact must be conducted in accordance with § 983.58, if a PHA is project-basing 50 percent or more of the PHA's authorized voucher units.

      (1) A PHA is not required to reduce the number of units to which it has committed PBV assistance under an Agreement or HAP contract if the number of authorized voucher units is subsequently reduced and the number of PBV units consequently exceeds the program limitation.

      (2) A PHA that was within the program limit prior to April 18, 2017, and exceeded the program limit on that date due solely to the change in how the program cap is calculated is not required to reduce the number of PBV units under an Agreement or HAP contract.

      (3) In the circumstances described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the PHA may not add units to PBV HAP contracts, or enter into new Agreements or HAP contracts (except for HAP contracts resulting from Agreements entered into before the reduction of authorized units or April 18, 2017, as applicable), unless such units meet the conditions described in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.

      (b)  All PBV units which the PHA has selected (from the time of the proposal or project selection date) or which are under an Agreement or HAP contract for PBV assistance count toward the 20 percent maximum or increased cap, as applicable, except as provided in paragraph (e).

      (c)  The PHA is responsible for determining the amount of budget authority that is available for project-based vouchers and for ensuring that the amount of assistance that is attached to units is within the amounts available under the ACC.

      (d)  A PHA may project-base an additional 10 percent of its authorized voucher units at the time of commitment, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, provided the additional units meet the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section:

      (1) The units are part of a HAP contract executed on or after April 18, 2017, or are added on or after that date to any current HAP contract, including a contract entered into prior to April 18, 2017, and the units fall into at least one of the following categories:

      (i) The units are specifically made available to house individuals and families that meet the definition of homeless under Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302), included in 24 CFR 578.3.

      (ii) The units are specifically made available to house families that are comprised of or include a veteran. For purposes of the increased cap, a veteran means a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom.

      (iii) The units provide supportive housing to persons with disabilities or to elderly persons, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403. Supportive housing means that the project makes supportive services available for all of the assisted families in the project and provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the residents occupying such housing. Such supportive services need not be provided by the owner or on site but must be reasonably available to the families receiving PBV assistance in the project. The PHA's Administrative Plan must describe the type and availability of supportive services the PHA will consider as qualifying for the 10 percent increased cap.

      (iv) The units are located in an area where vouchers are difficult to use as defined in § 983.3.

      (v) The units replace, on a different site, the units listed in § 983.59(b)(1) and (2) for which the PHA had authority under § 983.59 to commit PBV assistance on the original site without the units counting toward the program cap or project cap. The units are eligible under this category only if the PHA has not committed and will not commit PBV assistance to the original site pursuant to the normally applicable exclusions of those units under § 983.59. If the PHA subsequently plans to commit PBV assistance to units on the original site, those proposed units count toward and must comply with the 20 percent maximum or increased cap of this section, as applicable, and the project cap requirements of § 983.54.

      (2) The units are part of a HAP contract executed on or after December 27, 2020, or are added on or after that date to any current HAP contract, including a contract entered into prior to December 27, 2020, and meet the following requirements:

      (i) The units are exclusively made available to eligible youth as described in Section 8(x)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act; and

      (ii) If the units exclusively made available to eligible youth use Family Unification Program (FUP) assistance that is normally available for eligible families and youth described in Section 8(x)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act, the PHA determines and documents that the limitation of the units to youth is consistent with the local housing needs of both eligible FUP populations (families and youth) and amends its Administrative Plan to specify that FUP PBV assistance is solely for eligible youth.

      (3) The PBV HAP contract must specify, and the owner must set aside, the number of units meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) and (d)(2) of this section. To qualify for the increased program cap for units meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) and (d)(2) of this section, the unit must be occupied by the type of family specified in the applicable paragraph consistent with the requirements of § 983.262.

      (e)  Units that meet the requirements of § 983.59 do not count toward the program cap. Such units are removed from the number of authorized voucher units for purposes of calculating the percentages under paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section.

      § 983.7   Uniform Relocation Act.

#### § § 983.7

      (a)  (1) A displaced person must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

      (2) The cost of required relocation assistance may be paid with funds provided by the owner, or with local public funds, or with funds available from other sources. Relocation costs may not be paid from voucher program funds; however, provided payment of relocation benefits is consistent with state and local law, PHAs may use their administrative fee reserve to pay for relocation assistance after all other program administrative expenses are satisfied. Use of the administrative fee reserve in this manner must be consistent with legal and regulatory requirements, including the requirements of 24 CFR 982.155 and other official HUD issuances.

      (b)  The acquisition of real property for a PBV project is subject to the URA and 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.

      (c)  The PHA must require the owner to comply with the URA and 49 CFR part 24.

      (d)  In computing a replacement housing payment to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the Agreement between the owner and the PHA.

      § 983.8   Equal opportunity requirements.

#### § § 983.8

      (a) The PBV program requires compliance with all equal opportunity requirements under federal law and regulation, including the authorities cited at 24 CFR 5.105(a).

      (b) The PHA must comply with the PHA Plan civil rights and affirmatively furthering fair housing certification submitted by the PHA in accordance with 24 CFR 903.7(o).

      § 983.9   Special housing types.

#### § § 983.9

      (a)  (1) For applicability of rules on special housing types at 24 CFR part 982, subpart M, see § 983.2.

      (2) In the PBV program, the PHA may not provide assistance for shared housing, manufactured home space rental, or the homeownership option.

      (b)  A group home may include one or more group home units. A separate lease is executed for each elderly person or person with disabilities who resides in a group home.

      (c)  (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, assistance under this housing type is subject to the regulations of part 983, except the following sections of part 983, subpart F: §§ 983.256(b) and (c), 983.258 and 983.259 do not apply.

      (2)  (i) Cooperative housing under the PBV program is also subject to the requirements of 24 CFR 982.619(b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (d), and (e).

      (ii) Cooperative housing under the PBV program is not subject to the requirements of 24 CFR 982.619(a), (b)(1), (b)(4), and (c).

      (3)  Rental assistance for PBV cooperative housing where families lease cooperative housing units from cooperative members is not a special housing type and all requirements of 24 CFR 983 apply.

      (4)  The regulations of 24 CFR part 983, subpart G, apply to PBV housing under paragraph (c) of this section. The reasonable rent for a cooperative unit is determined in accordance with § 983.303. For cooperative housing, the rent to owner is the monthly carrying charge under the occupancy agreement/lease between the member and the cooperative.

      (5)  Fees such as application fees, credit report fees, and transfer fees shall not be included in the rent to owner.

    Subpart B—Selection of PBV Proposals and Projects

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437f and 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 38309, May 7, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

      § 983.51   Proposal and project selection procedures.

#### § § 983.51

      (a)  The PHA Administrative Plan must describe the procedures for submission and selection of PBV proposals under the methods of competitive selection in paragraph (b) of this section and selection of projects under an exception to competitive selection under paragraph (c) of this section. The description must include under what circumstances the PHA will use the selection methods described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The PHA may allow for entities that have site control to submit proposals provided the entity will be the owner prior to entering into the Agreement or HAP contract. Before selecting a PBV proposal or project, the PHA must determine that the PBV proposal or project complies with HUD program regulations and requirements, including a determination that the property is eligible housing (§§ 983.52 and 983.53), complies with the cap on the number of PBV units per project (§ 983.54), and meets the site selection standards (§ 983.55). An owner may submit, and a PHA may select, a single proposal covering multiple projects where each project consists of a single-family building, provided all projects are the same housing type (existing, rehabilitated, or newly constructed).

      (b)  The PHA must select PBV proposals in accordance with the selection procedures in the PHA Administrative Plan. (See paragraph (f) of this section for information about the selection of PHA-owned units.) The PHA must select PBV proposals by either of the following two methods:

      (1) The PHA may issue a request for proposals (RFP), selecting a PBV proposal through a competition. The PHA's RFP may not limit proposals to a single site or impose restrictions that explicitly or practically preclude owner submission of proposals for PBV housing on different sites. A PHA may establish selection procedures in the Administrative Plan that combine or are in conjunction with other Federal, State, or local government housing assistance, community development, or supportive services competitive selection processes. If the PHA selection process is combined and administered in conjunction with another RFP process, the PHA remains responsible for complying with § 983.51. See § 983.157(a)(2) for additional requirements for an RFP for rehabilitated housing.

      (2) The PHA may select, without issuing an RFP, a proposal for housing assisted under a Federal, State, or local government housing assistance, community development, or supportive services program that required competitive selection of proposals, where the proposal has been selected in accordance with such program's competitive selection requirements within three years of the PBV proposal selection date. The PHA may not select a housing assistance proposal using this method if the competition involved any consideration that the project would receive PBV assistance.

      (c)  Prior to selection under this paragraph (c), the PHA must notify the public of its intent to noncompetitively select one or more projects for PBV assistance through its 5-Year Plan.

      (1) A PHA engaged in an initiative to improve, develop, or replace a public housing property or site may select for PBV assistance an existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated project in which the PHA has an ownership interest or over which the PHA has control without following a competitive process.

      (i) With respect to replacement housing, the PHA does not have to replace the housing on the same site as the original public housing, but the number of contract units in the replacement project may not exceed the number of units in the original public housing project by more than a de minimis amount for this exception to apply.

      (ii) The public housing properties or sites may be in the public housing inventory at the time of project selection or they may have been removed from the public housing inventory through any available legal removal tool within five years of the project selection date.

      (2) A PHA may select for future PBV assistance a project currently under the public housing program, or a project that is replacing the public housing project, in which a PHA has no ownership interest, or which a PHA has no control over, without following a competitive process, provided:

      (i) The public housing project is either still in the public housing inventory or had been removed from the public housing inventory through any available legal removal tool within five years of the project selection date;

      (ii) The PHA that owned or owns the public housing project does not administer the HCV program;

      (iii) The project selected for PBV assistance was specifically identified as replacement housing for the impacted public housing residents as part of the public housing demolition/disposition application, voluntary conversion application, or any other application process submitted to and approved by HUD to remove the public housing project from the public housing inventory; and

      (iv) With respect to replacement housing, the PHA does not have to replace the housing on the same site as the original public housing, but the number of contract units in the replacement project may not exceed the number of units in the original public housing project by more than a de minimis amount for this exception to apply.

      (3) A PHA may select for PBV assistance a project consisting of PHA-owned units as defined at 24 CFR 982.4 without following a competitive process.

      (i) The project units must continue to meet the definition of PHA-owned for the initial two years of the HAP contract unless there is a transfer of ownership approved by HUD.

      (ii) The PHA must meet any conditions with respect to selection for PBV assistance of a project consisting of PHA-owned units without following a competitive process as may be established by HUD through publication in the  notice after providing opportunity for public comment.

      (4) A PHA may select for PBV assistance a project that underwent an eligibility event within five years of the project selection date, in which a family (or families) qualifies for enhanced voucher assistance under Section 8(t) of the Act and provides informed consent to relinquish its enhanced voucher for PBV assistance, without following a competitive process.

      (d)  If the PHA will be selecting proposals under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, PHA procedures for selecting PBV proposals must be designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice of the opportunity to offer PBV proposals for consideration by the PHA. The public notice procedures may include publication of the public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation and other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice. The public notice of the PHA request for PBV proposals must specify the submission deadline. Detailed application and selection information must be provided at the request of interested parties.

      (e)  (1) The PHA must examine the proposed site before the proposal or project selection date to determine whether the site complies with the site selection standards in accordance with § 983.55.

      (2) The PHA may execute a HAP contract for existing housing if:

      (i) All proposed contract units in the project fully or substantially comply with the HQS on the proposal or project selection date, which the PHA must determine via inspection;

      (ii) The project meets the environmental review requirements at § 983.56, if applicable;

      (iii) The project meets the initial inspection requirements in accordance with § 983.103(c).

      (f)  (1) For selection of proposals through competitive methods under paragraph (b) of this section, the PHA must give prompt written notice of proposal selection to the party that submitted a selected proposal and must also give prompt public notice of such selection. The PHA's requirement to provide public notice may be met via publication of the public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation or other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice. The written notice of proposal selection must require the owner or party that submitted the selected proposal to provide a written response to the PHA accepting the terms and requirements stated in the notice.

      (2) For selection of projects through exceptions to competition under paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA must give prompt written notice of project selection to the owner following the PHA board's resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the specific project. The written notice of project selection must require the owner of the project selected to provide a written response to the PHA accepting the terms and requirements stated in the notice.

      (3) Regardless of the method of selection, if the project contains PHA-owned units that are not owned by a separate legal entity from the PHA, the PHA must provide the written notice of proposal or project selection to the responsible PHA official, and that official must certify in writing that the PHA accepts the terms and requirements stated in the notice.

      (4) When an environmental review is required, if such a review has not been conducted prior to the project or proposal selection date, the PHA's written notice of project or proposal selection must state that the selection is subject to completion of a favorable environmental review and that the project or proposal may be rejected based on the results of the environmental review in accordance with 983.56(c).

      (5) See § 983.153(c)(3) for additional notice requirements for newly constructed housing and rehabilitated housing.

      (g)  (1) The proposal selection date is the date on which the PHA provides written notice to the party that submitted the selected proposal under either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

      (2) For properties selected in accordance with § 983.51(c), the project selection date is the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the specific project.

      (h)  A PHA-owned unit may be assisted under the PBV program only if the HUD field office or the independent entity reviews the project selection process the PHA undertook and determines that the project was appropriately selected based on the selection procedures specified in the PHA Administrative Plan. Under no circumstance may a HAP contract be effective for any of the subsidized housing types set forth in § 983.53(a). With the exception of projects selected in accordance with § 983.51(c), the PHA's selection procedures must be designed in a manner that does not effectively eliminate the submission of proposals for non-PHA-owned units or give preferential treatment ( additional points) to _PHA-owned units._

      (i)  The PHA must make documentation available for public inspection regarding the basis for the PHA selection of a PBV proposal.

      (j)  HUD approval of specific projects or owners is not required. For example, owner proposal selection does not require submission of form HUD-2530 (Previous Participation Certification) or other HUD previous participation clearance.

      (k)  A PHA may not commit project-based assistance to a project if the owner or any principal or interested party is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424 or is listed on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement or non-procurement programs.

      § 983.52   Prohibition of assistance for ineligible units.

#### § § 983.52

      (a)  A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for any of the following:

      (1) Shared housing;

      (2) Units on the grounds of a penal, reformatory, medical, mental, or similar public or private institution;

      (3) Nursing homes or facilities providing continuous psychiatric, medical, nursing services, board and care, or intermediate care. However, the PHA may execute a HAP contract and provide PBV assistance for a dwelling unit in an assisted living facility that provides home health care services such as nursing and therapy for residents of the housing;

      (4) Units that are owned or controlled by an educational institution or its affiliate and are designated for occupancy by students of the institution;

      (5) Manufactured homes are ineligible only if the manufactured home is not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation or the owner does not own fee title to the real property (land) on which the manufactured home is located; and

      (6) Transitional Housing.

      (b)  A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for a unit occupied by an owner of the housing. A member of a cooperative who owns shares in the project assisted under the PBV program shall not be considered an owner for purposes of participation in the PBV program.

      (c)  Before a PHA places a specific unit under a HAP contract, the PHA must determine whether the unit is occupied and, if occupied, whether the unit's occupants are eligible for assistance in accordance with § 982.201 of this title. Additionally, for a family to be eligible for assistance in the specific unit, the unit must be appropriate for the size of the family under the PHA's subsidy standards and the total tenant payment for the family must be less than the gross rent for the unit, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP. The PHA must not enter into a HAP contract for a unit occupied by a family ineligible for participation in the PBV program.

      (d)  Unless a PHA has exercised the discretion at § 983.154(f), to undertake development activity without an Agreement or to execute an Agreement after construction or rehabilitation that complied with applicable requirements of § 983.153 has commenced, or at § 983.157, to undertake development activity after execution of the HAP contract, the PHA may not execute a HAP contract for units on which construction or rehabilitation commenced after the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection) and prior to the effective date of an Agreement. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve a PHA's request for an exception to this prohibition. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including the nature and extent of the construction or rehabilitation that has commenced.

      (1) Units for which rehabilitation or new construction began after proposal submission or the date of board resolution but prior to the effective date of an Agreement (if applicable), as described in this paragraph (d), do not subsequently qualify as existing housing.

      (2) Units that were newly constructed or rehabilitated in violation of program requirements do not qualify as existing housing.

      § 983.53   Prohibition of assistance for units in subsidized housing.

#### § § 983.53

      (a)  A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for any of the following:

      (1) A public housing dwelling unit;

      (2) A unit subsidized with any other form of Section 8 assistance (tenant-based or project-based);

      (3) A unit subsidized with any governmental rent subsidy (a subsidy that pays all or any part of the rent);

      (4) A unit subsidized with any governmental subsidy that covers all or any part of the operating costs of the housing;

      (5) A unit subsidized with rental assistance payments under Section 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1490a (a Rural Housing Service Program). However, the PHA may attach assistance for a unit subsidized with Section 515 interest reduction payments (42 U.S.C. 1485);

      (6) A Section 202 project for non-elderly persons with disabilities (assistance under Section 162 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 12 U.S.C. 1701q note);

      (7) Section 811 project-based supportive housing for persons with disabilities (42 U.S.C. 8013);

      (8) Section 202 supportive housing for the elderly (12 U.S.C. 1701q);

      (9) A unit subsidized with any form of tenant-based rental assistance (as defined at 24 CFR 982.1(b)(2)) ( a unit subsidized with tenant-based rental assistance under the HOME program, 42 U.S.C. 12701 ); or

      (10) A unit with any other duplicative Federal, State, or local housing subsidy, as determined by HUD or by the PHA in accordance with HUD requirements. For this purpose, “housing subsidy” does not include the housing component of a welfare payment; a social security payment; or a Federal, State, or local tax concession (such as relief from local real property taxes).

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 983.54   Cap on number of PBV units in each project (income-mixing requirement).

#### § § 983.54

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, a PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract if the number of assisted units in a project is more than the greater of 25 percent of the number of dwelling units (assisted and unassisted, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (c)(3)) in the project or 25 units.

      (b)  A PHA may provide PBV assistance to the greater of 25 units or 40 percent of the number of dwelling units (assisted and unassisted, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) in the project if the project is located in an area where vouchers are difficult to use as defined in § 983.3.

      (c)  (1) A project is not limited to a single exception category but may include excepted units from any of the exception categories under paragraph (2) and excluded units under paragraph (3) below.

      (2) PBV units are not counted toward the project cap in the following cases:

      (i) Units exclusively serving elderly families, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403;

      (ii) Units exclusively made available to eligible youth described in Section 8(x)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act. If the units exclusively made available to eligible youth use Family Unification Program (FUP) assistance that is normally available for eligible families and youth, the PHA must determine that the limitation of the units to youth is consistent with the local housing needs of both eligible FUP populations (families and youth), maintain documentation to support this determination, and amend its Administrative Plan to include the limitation of these FUP PBV units to eligible youth; or

      (iii) Units exclusively made available to households eligible for supportive services available to the residents of the project assisted with PBV assistance. The project must make supportive services available to all PBV-assisted families in the project, but the family may not be required to participate in the services as a condition of living in the excepted unit. Such supportive services need not be provided by the owner or on-site but must be reasonably available to the families receiving PBV assistance in the project and designed to help the families in the project achieve self-sufficiency or live in the community as independently as possible. The supportive services must be made available to the family within a reasonable time as defined by the PHA, but not to exceed 120 calendar days from the family's request. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the types of services offered to families that will enable the units to qualify under the exception and the extent to which such services will be provided ( length of time services will be provided to a family, frequency of services, and depth of services), and the reasonable time by which such services must be made available to the family, not to exceed 120 calendar days. A PHA that manages an FSS program may offer FSS to meet the exception. The PHA may also make the supportive services used in connection with the FSS program available to non-FSS PBV families at the project.

      (3) Units that are excluded under § 983.59 do not count toward the project cap. Such units are removed from the number of dwelling units for purposes of calculating the percentages under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (4)(i) The PBV HAP contract must specify, and the owner must set aside, the number of excepted units made available for occupancy by families who qualify for the exception.

      (ii) For a unit to be considered excepted it must be occupied by a family who qualifies for the exception.

      (d)  (1) In general, HAP contracts in effect prior to April 18, 2017, when the exception at paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section came into effect and a prior exception for disabled families was removed, or prior to December 27, 2020, when the exception at paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section came into effect, are governed by those HAP contracts' terms concerning the number and type of excepted units in a project. The owner must continue to designate the same number of contract units and assist the same number and type of excepted units as provided under the HAP contract during the remaining term of the HAP contract and any extension.

      (2) The owner and the PHA may mutually agree to change the requirements for excepted units under the HAP contract to comply with the excepted unit requirements in subsection (c) of this section. However, any change to the HAP contract may only be made if the change does not jeopardize an assisted family's eligibility for continued assistance at the project.

      (e)  The PHA determines the number of units in the project for which the PHA will provide project-based assistance, including whether and how many units will be excepted, subject to the provisions of this section. See § 983.262 for occupancy requirements of excepted units.

      (f)  HUD may establish additional monitoring and oversight requirements for PBV projects in which more than 40 percent of the dwelling units are assisted under a PBV HAP contract through a  Notice, subject to public comment.

      § 983.55   Site selection standards.

#### § § 983.55

      (a)  The site selection requirements in paragraph (d) of this section apply only to site selection for existing housing and rehabilitated PBV housing. The site selection requirements in paragraph (e) of this section apply only to site selection for newly constructed PBV housing. Other provisions of this section apply to selection of a site for any form of PBV housing, including existing housing, newly constructed housing, and rehabilitated housing.

      (b)  The PHA may not select a project or proposal for existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated PBV housing on a site or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract for units on the site, unless the PHA has determined that:

      (1) Project-based assistance for housing at the selected site is consistent with the goal of deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities. The standard for deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities must be consistent with the PHA Plan under 24 CFR part 903 and the PHA Administrative Plan. In developing the standards to apply in determining whether a proposed PBV development will be selected, a PHA must consider the following:

      (i) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is in a HUD-designated Enterprise Zone, Economic Community, or Renewal Community;

      (ii) Whether a PBV development will be located in a census tract where the concentration of assisted units will be or has decreased as a result of public housing demolition;

      (iii) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is undergoing significant revitalization;

      (iv) Whether State, local, or Federal dollars have been invested in the area that has assisted in the achievement of the statutory requirement;

      (v) Whether new market rate units are being developed in the same census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located and the likelihood that such market rate units will positively impact the poverty rate in the area;

      (vi) If the poverty rate in the area where the proposed PBV development will be located is greater than 20 percent, the PHA must consider whether in the past five years there has been an overall decline in the poverty rate;

      (vii) Whether there are meaningful opportunities for educational and economic advancement in the census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located.

      (2) The site is suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d(4)) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601-3629) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100 through 199; Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 652) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107. The site must also be suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations (28 CFR part 35), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including meeting the Section 504 site selection requirements described in 24 CFR 8.4(b)(5).

      (3) The site and neighborhood is reasonably free from disturbing noises and reverberations and other dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the occupants. The site and neighborhood may not be subject to serious adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, that could affect the health or safety of the project occupants, such as dangerous walks or steps; contamination; instability; flooding, poor drainage, septic tank back-ups or sewage hazards; mudslides; abnormal air pollution, smoke or dust; excessive noise, vibration or vehicular traffic; excessive accumulations of trash; vermin or rodent infestation; or fire hazards.

      (c)  (1) The PHA Administrative Plan must establish the PHA's policy for selection of PBV sites in accordance with this section.

      (2) The site selection policy must explain how the PHA's site selection procedures promote the PBV goals.

      (3) The PHA must select PBV sites in accordance with the PHA's site selection policy in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (d)  A site for existing or rehabilitated housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards. The site must:

      (1) Be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities and streets must be available to service the site. (The existence of a private disposal system and private sanitary water supply for the site, approved in accordance with law, may be considered adequate utilities.)

      (2) Promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.

      (3) Be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.

      (4) Be so located that travel time and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers is not excessive. While it is important that housing for the elderly not be totally isolated from employment opportunities, this requirement need not be adhered to rigidly for such projects.

      (e)  A site for newly constructed housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards:

      (1) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities (water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets must be available to service the site.

      (2) The site must not be located in an area of minority concentration, except as permitted under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and must not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to non-minority residents in the area.

      (3) A project may be located in an area of minority concentration only if:

      (i) Sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority families in the income range to be served by the proposed project outside areas of minority concentration (see paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) through (v) of this section for further guidance on this criterion); or

      (ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot be met in that housing market area (see paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section for further guidance on this criterion).

      (iii) As used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, “sufficient” does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year, that, over a period of several years, will approach an appropriate balance of housing choices within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for low-income minority families and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.

      (iv) Units may be considered “comparable opportunities,” as used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, if they have the same household type (elderly, disabled, family, large family) and tenure type (owner/renter); require approximately the same tenant contribution towards rent; serve the same income group; are located in the same housing market; and are in standard condition.

      (v) Application of this sufficient, comparable opportunities standard involves assessing the overall impact of HUD-assisted housing on the availability of housing choices for low-income minority families in and outside areas of minority concentration, and must take into account the extent to which the following factors are present, along with other factors relevant to housing choice:

      (A) A significant number of assisted housing units are available outside areas of minority concentration.

      (B) There is significant integration of assisted housing projects constructed or rehabilitated in the past 10 years, relative to the racial mix of the eligible population.

      (C) There are racially integrated neighborhoods in the locality.

      (D) Programs are operated by the locality to assist minority families that wish to find housing outside areas of minority concentration.

      (E) Minority families have benefited from local activities ( acquisition and write-down of sites, tax relief programs for homeowners, acquisitions of units for use as assisted housing units) undertaken to expand choice for minority families outside of areas of minority concentration.

      (F) A significant proportion of minority households has been successful in finding units in non-minority areas under the tenant-based assistance programs.

      (G) Comparable housing opportunities have been made available outside areas of minority concentration through other programs.

      (vi) Application of the “overriding housing needs” criterion, for example, permits approval of sites that are an integral part of an overall local strategy for the preservation or restoration of the immediate neighborhood and of sites in a neighborhood experiencing significant private investment that is demonstrably improving the economic character of the area (a “revitalizing area”). An “overriding housing need,” however, may not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable, if the only reason the need cannot otherwise be feasibly met is that discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, or disability renders sites outside areas of minority concentration unavailable or if the use of this standard in recent years has had the effect of circumventing the obligation to provide housing choice.

      (4) The site must promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.

      (5) The neighborhood must not be one that is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other undesirable conditions predominate, unless there is actively in progress a concerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions.

      (6) The housing must be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.

      (7) Except for housing designed for elderly persons, travel time and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers, must not be excessive.

      § 983.56   Environmental review.

#### § § 983.56

      (a)  (1) HUD environmental regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58 apply to activities under the PBV program, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (2) For projects or proposals that were selected in accordance with the site selection standards at § 983.55 in effect on or after June 6, 2024, no environmental review is required to be undertaken before entering into a HAP contract for existing housing, except to the extent a Federal environmental review is required by law or regulation relating to funding other than PBV housing assistance payments.

      (b)  Under 24 CFR part 58, the unit of general local government within which the project is located that exercises land use responsibility, the county, or the State (the “responsible entity” or “RE”), is responsible for the Federal environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 ) and related applicable Federal laws and authorities in accordance with 24 CFR 58.5 and 58.6. If a PHA objects in writing to having the RE perform the Federal environmental review, or if the RE declines to perform it, then HUD may perform the review itself (24 CFR 58.11). 24 CFR part 50 governs HUD performance of the review.

      (c)  When an environmental review is required, if such a review has not been conducted prior to the proposal or project selection date, then the PHA's written notice of proposal or project selection must state that the selection is subject to completion of a favorable environmental review and that the project may be rejected based on the results of the environmental review.

      (d)  When an environmental review is required, a PHA may not execute an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner, and the PHA, the owner, and its contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish, or construct real property or commit or expend program or local funds for these activities, until one of the following occurs:

      (1) The responsible entity has determined that the activities to be undertaken are exempt under 24 CFR 58.34(a) or categorically excluded and not subject to compliance with environmental laws under 24 CFR 58.35(b);

      (2) The responsible entity has completed the environmental review procedures required by 24 CFR part 58, and HUD has approved the PHA's Request for Release of Funds and Certification (form HUD-7015.15). HUD approves the Request for Release of Funds and Certification by issuing a Letter to Proceed or form HUD-7015.16, thereby authorizing the PHA to execute an Agreement or HAP contract, as applicable; or

      (3) HUD has performed an environmental review under 24 CFR part 50 and has notified the PHA in writing of environmental clearance.

      (e)  HUD will not issue a Letter to Proceed or form HUD-7015.16 to the PHA or provide environmental clearance if the PHA, the owner, or its contractors have undertaken any of the activities described in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (f)  The PHA must document any mitigating measures or other conditions as provided in 24 CFR part 50 or 58, as applicable, and must complete or require the owner to carry out such measures and conditions.

      (g)  The PHA must supply all available, relevant information necessary for the RE (or HUD, if applicable) to perform the required environmental review.

      § 983.57   PHA-owned units.

#### § § 983.57

      (a)  The selection of PHA-owned units must be done in accordance with § 983.51(h).

      (b)  In connection with PHA-owned units:

      (1) The independent entity must determine rent to owner, including rent reasonableness and calculating any rent adjustments by an OCAF (where applicable), in accordance with §§ 983.301 through 983.305.

      (2) The independent entity must perform unit inspections in accordance with § 983.103(g).

      (3) When the owner carries out development activity under § 983.152 or substantial improvement under §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212, the independent entity must review the evidence and work completion certification submitted by the owner in accordance with § 983.155(b) and determine if the units are complete in accordance with § 983.156.

      (4) The independent entity must determine whether to approve substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract in accordance with § 983.212.

      (c)  The PHA may compensate the independent entity from PHA administrative fees (including fees credited to the administrative fee reserve) for the services performed by the independent entity. The PHA may not use other program receipts to compensate the independent entity for such services. The PHA and the independent entity may not charge the family any fee or charge for the services provided by the independent entity.

      § 983.58   PHA determination prior to selection.

#### § § 983.58

      (a)  A PHA must calculate the number of authorized voucher units that it is permitted to project-base in accordance with § 983.6 and determine the amount of budget authority that it has available for project-basing in accordance with § 983.5(b), before it issues a request for proposals in accordance with § 983.51(b)(1), makes a selection based on a previous competition in accordance with § 983.51(b)(2), amends an existing HAP contract to add units in accordance with § 983.207(b), or noncompetitively selects a project in accordance with § 983.51(c).

      (b)  Prior to selecting a project for PBV assistance, a PHA must perform an analysis of the impact if project-basing 50 percent or more of the PHA's authorized voucher units. The analysis should consider the ability of the PHA to meet the needs of the community across its tenant-based and project-based voucher portfolio, including the impact on, among others: families on the waiting list and eligible PBV families that wish to move under § 983.261. The analysis performed by the PHA must be available as part of the public record.

      § 983.59   Units excluded from program cap and project cap.

#### § § 983.59

      (a)  For HAP contracts entered into on or after April 18, 2017, the PHA may commit project-based assistance to units that meet the requirements for exclusion in paragraph (b) of this section. Such units do not count toward the program cap or project cap described in §§ 983.6 and 983.54, respectively.

      (b)  Excluded units must, in the five years prior to the request for proposals (RFP) or the proposal or project selection date in the case of selection without RFP, fall into one of the following categories provided that the units are removed from all categories prior to the effective date of the HAP contract:

      (1) The units have received one of the following forms of HUD assistance:

      (i) Public Housing Capital or Operating Funds (Section 9 of the 1937 Act);

      (ii) Project-Based Rental Assistance (Section 8 of the 1937 Act). Project-based rental assistance under Section 8 includes the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, including the single-room occupancy (SRO) program;

      (iii) Housing For the Elderly (Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959);

      (iv) Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act);

      (v) Rental Assistance Program (RAP) (Section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act); or

      (vi) Flexible Subsidy Program (Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments Act of 1978).

      (2) The units have been subject to a federally required rent restriction under one of the following programs:

      (i) The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (26 U.S.C. 42);

      (ii) Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Loans (42 U.S.C. 1485); or

      (iii) The following HUD programs:

      (A) Section 236;

      (B) Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate;

      (C) Housing For the Elderly (Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959);

      (D) Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act);

      (E) Flexible Subsidy Program (Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments Act of 1978); or

      (iv) Any other program identified by HUD through  notice subject to public comment.

      (c)  Newly constructed units developed under the PBV program may be excluded from the program cap and project cap provided the primary purpose of the newly constructed units is or was to replace units that meet the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The newly constructed unit must be located on the same site as the unit it is replacing; however, an expansion of or modification to the prior project's site boundaries as a result of the design of the newly constructed project is acceptable as long as a majority of the replacement units are built back on the site of the original project and any replacement units that are not located on the existing site are part of a project that shares a common border with, are across a public right of way from, or touch that site. In addition, in order for the replacement units to be excluded from the program and project caps, one of the following must be true:

      (1) Former residents of the original project must be provided with a selection preference that provides the residents with the right of first occupancy at the PBV newly constructed project when it is ready for occupancy.

      (2) Prior to the demolition of the original project, the PBV newly constructed project must have been identified as replacement housing for that original project as part of a documented plan for the redevelopment of the site.

      (d)  The unit size configuration of the PBV newly constructed or rehabilitated project may differ from the unit size configuration of the original project that the PBV units are replacing. In addition, the total number of PBV-assisted units may differ from the number of units in the original project. However, only the total number of units in the original project are excluded from the program cap and the project cap. Units that exceed the total number of covered units in the original project are subject to the program cap and the project cap.

      (e)  The 10 percent exception under § 983.6 and the project cap exception under § 983.54(c)(2) are inapplicable to excluded units under this section.

    Subpart C—Dwelling Units

      § 983.101   Housing quality standards.

#### § § 983.101

      (a)  As defined in § 983.3, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 of this title for housing assisted under the PBV program, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3).

      (b)  For special housing types assisted under the PBV program, HQS applies to the PBV program except as specified in 24 CFR part 982, subpart M. Provisions contained within 24 CFR part 982 that are inapplicable to the PBV program pursuant to § 983.2 are also inapplicable to special housing types under the PBV program.

      (c)  The Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R, apply to the PBV program.

      (d)  Parts 982 and 983 of this chapter do not create any right of the family or any party, other than HUD or the PHA, to require enforcement of the HQS requirements or to assert any claim against HUD or the PHA for damages, injunction, or other relief for alleged failure to enforce the HQS.

      (e)  This section establishes the minimum federal housing quality standards for PBV housing. However, the PHA may elect to establish additional requirements for quality, architecture, or design of PBV housing.

> [70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36167, June 25, 2014; 88 FR 30504, May 11, 2023; 89 FR 38315, May 7, 2024]

      § 983.102   Housing accessibility for persons with disabilities.

#### § § 983.102

      (a)  The housing must comply with program accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8. The PHA shall ensure that the percentage of accessible dwelling units complies with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as implemented by HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 8, subpart C.

      (b)  Housing first occupied after March 13, 1991, must comply with design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205, as applicable.

      § 983.103   Inspecting units.

#### § § 983.103

      (a)  If the units to be assisted already exist, the PHA must inspect all units before the proposal or project selection date and must determine if the project meets the definition of existing housing. If the project is existing housing, the PHA may not execute the HAP contract until all units meet the initial inspection requirements in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (b)  Following completion of work pursuant to § 983.155, the PHA must complete the following inspection(s), as applicable in accordance with § 983.156:

      (1) For rehabilitated housing that is developed prior to the HAP contract term or newly constructed housing, the PHA must inspect each proposed newly constructed and rehabilitated PBV unit before execution of the HAP contract. Each proposed PBV unit must fully comply with HQS prior to HAP contract execution.

      (2) For rehabilitated housing that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the PHA must conduct unit inspections in accordance with the requirements of § 983.157.

      (3) Inspect each unit that underwent substantial improvement pursuant to §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212. Each PBV unit that underwent substantial improvement must fully comply with HQS prior to the PHA adding the unit to the HAP contract, returning the unit temporarily removed to the HAP contract, allowing re-occupancy of the unit, and resuming housing assistance payments, as applicable.

      (c) —(1)  In accordance with this paragraph, the PHA may adopt in its Administrative Plan the non-life-threatening deficiencies option or the alternative inspection option, or both, for initial inspections of existing housing. If the PHA has not adopted the initial inspection non-life-threatening deficiency option (NLT option) or the alternative inspection option for the project, the PHA must inspect and determine that all of the proposed PBV units fully comply with HQS before entering the HAP contract. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan the amount of time that may elapse between the initial inspection of existing housing and execution of a HAP contract for that unit.

      (2)  (i) A PHA may execute the HAP contract and begin making assistance payments for all of the assisted units, including units that failed the initial HQS inspection, provided that no units have life-threatening deficiencies and if the owner agrees to the NLT option. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option and the alternative inspections option under paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (ii) After completing the inspections and determining there are no life-threatening deficiencies, for any unit with non-life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA must provide both the owner and the family (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list being offered that unit) a list of the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and an explanation of the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance if the owner does not complete the repairs within 30 days. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will remove the unit from the HAP contract, and the family will be issued a voucher to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. If the PHA's Administrative Plan provides that the PHA will terminate the PBV HAP contract if the owner fails to correct deficiencies in any unit in the project within the cure period, the PHA must also provide the notice described above to families referred to units without any deficiencies. The family referred from the waiting list may choose to decline the unit and remain on the waiting list. An eligible in-place family may decline the unit, and the PHA must issue the family a tenant-based voucher to move from the unit in that circumstance.

      (iii) If the family decides to lease the unit, the family enters into the assisted lease with the owner. The PHA commences making assistance payments to the owner.

      (iv) The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments for the unit until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (v) The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan the maximum amount of time it will withhold payments before abating payments and the number of days after which the PHA will either terminate the PBV HAP contract or remove the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b).

      (vi) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of a family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During any period the assistance is abated under the NLT option, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner and the PHA, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-based assistance. In the case of an in-place family, the family may also choose to terminate the tenancy during the withholding period following the 30-day cure period, and the PHA must offer the family either another assisted unit in the PBV project that fully complies with HQS or tenant-based assistance.

      (3)  The PHA may adopt the alternative inspection option for initial inspections of existing housing, subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).

      (i) After the PHA determines the project meets the definition of existing housing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may execute the HAP contract for the project if the project has been inspected in the previous 24 months using an alternative inspection that meets the requirements of 24 CFR 982.406, as opposed to re-inspecting the project to make sure all units fully comply with HQS before executing the HAP contract, if the owner agrees to the use of the alternative inspection option. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the alternative inspection option for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (ii) The PHA notifies all families (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list being offered a contract unit) that will occupy a contract unit before the PHA conducts the HQS inspection that the alternative inspection option is in effect for the project. The PHA must provide each family with the PHA list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. A family on the waiting list may decline to accept an offered unit due to unit conditions and retain its place on the PBV waiting list.

      (iii) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days of the proposal or project selection date. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under paragraph (f) of this section or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.

      (iv) The PHA may not commence housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected all the units under the HAP contract and determined they meet HQS.

      (v) If the PHA inspection finds that any contract unit contains HQS deficiencies, the PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected in all contract units. If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days (or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later.

      (vi) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan the maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner does not correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments and the date by which the PHA will either remove the unit from the HAP contract or terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title.

      (vii) If the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable time periods, the PHA must abate the payments for the non-compliant units, while continuing to withhold payments for the HQS compliant units until all the units meet HQS or the unit removal or contract termination occurs. If the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (viii) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of a family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During the abatement period, a family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-based assistance. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title.

      (4)  The PHA may adopt both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option for initial inspections of existing housing, subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).

      (i) If the owner agrees to both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option, then the PHA notifies all families (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list that will occupy the unit before the PHA conducts the HQS inspection) that both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option will be used for the family's unit. As part of this notification, the PHA must provide the family with the PHA's list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening. A family on the waiting list may decline to move into a unit due to unit conditions and retain its place on the PBV waiting list. Following inspection (see paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section), the PHA must provide any family referred from the PBV waiting list that will occupy a unit with non-life-threatening deficiencies a list of the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and an explanation of the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance if the owner does not complete the repairs within 30 days. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will remove the unit from the HAP contract, and the family will be issued a voucher to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. The family referred from the waiting list may choose to decline the unit and remain on the PBV waiting list.

      (ii) The PHA executes the HAP contract with the owner on the basis of the alternative inspection. The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days after the proposal or project selection date. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA during this interim period, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under paragraph (f) of this section or within 30 days of the proposal or project selection date, whichever time period ends first.

      (iii) The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected all the assisted units.

      (iv) If none of the units have any life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA commences payments and makes retroactive payments to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later, for all the assisted units. For any unit that failed the PHA's HQS inspection but has no life-threatening deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiencies within no more than 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments for that unit until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the unit is in compliance with HQS, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (v) If any units have life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA may not commence making housing assistance payments to the owner for any units until all the HQS deficiencies (life-threatening and non-life-threatening) have been corrected. The PHA must not refer families from the PBV waiting list to occupy units with life-threatening deficiencies. The owner must correct all life-threatening deficiencies within no more than 24 hours. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within no more than 30 calendar days (or any PHA-approved extension). If the owner corrects all of the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA must make the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later. If the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable time periods, the PHA must abate the payments for the non-compliant units, while continuing to withhold payments for the HQS compliant units until all the units meet HQS or the unit removal or contract termination occurs. If the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.

      (vi) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During the period the assistance is abated, a family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-based assistance. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family with tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan:

      (A) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and

      (B) The number of days after which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract or remove the unit from the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (d)  Before providing assistance to a new family in a contract unit, the PHA must inspect the unit. The PHA must not provide assistance on behalf of a family for a unit that fails to comply fully with HQS.

      (e)  (1) At least biennially during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA must inspect a random sample, consisting of at least 20 percent of the contract units in each building, to determine if the contract units and the premises are maintained in accordance with HQS. Turnover inspections pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section are not counted toward meeting this inspection requirement. Instead of biennially, a small rural PHA, as defined in § 902.101 of this title, must inspect the random sample of units in accordance with this paragraph at least once every three years. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan the frequency of periodic inspections. This requirement applies in the case of a HAP contract that is undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157; however, if the periodic inspection occurs during the period of development activity covered by the rider and fewer than 20 percent of contract units in each building are designated in the rider as available for occupancy, the PHA is only required to inspect the units in that building that are designated as available for occupancy.

      (2) If more than 20 percent of the sample of inspected contract units in a building fail the initial inspection, then the PHA must reinspect 100 percent of the contract units in the building.

      (3) A PHA may also use alternative inspections to meet the requirements for periodic inspections in this paragraph (e), subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).

      (f)  (1)  When a participant family or government official notifies the PHA of a potential deficiency, the following conditions apply:

      (i)  If the reported deficiency is life-threatening, the PHA must, within 24 hours, both inspect the housing unit and notify the owner if the life-threatening deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 24 hours of PHA notification.

      (ii)  If the reported deficiency is non-life-threatening, the PHA must, within 15 days, both inspect the unit and notify the owner if the deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 30 days of the notification from the PHA or within any PHA-approved extension.

      (iii)  In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may approve an exception of the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.

      (2)  The PHA must conduct follow-up inspections needed to determine if the owner (or, if applicable, the family) has corrected an HQS violation, except where the PHA is using a verification method as described in paragraph (h) of this section, and must conduct inspections to determine the basis for exercise of contractual and other remedies for owner or family violation of the HQS. (Family HQS obligations are specified in 24 CFR 982.404(b).)

      (3)  In conducting PHA supervisory quality control HQS inspections, the PHA should include a representative sample of both tenant-based and project-based units.

      (g)  (1) In the case of PHA-owned units, the inspections required under this section must be performed by an independent entity designated in accordance with § 983.57, rather than by the PHA.

      (2) The independent entity must furnish a copy of each inspection report to the PHA.

      (3) The PHA must take all necessary actions in response to inspection reports from the independent entity, including exercise of contractual remedies for violation of the HAP contract by the PHA owner.

      (h)  When a PHA must verify correction of a deficiency, the PHA may use verification methods other than another on-site inspection. The PHA may establish different verification methods for initial and subsequent inspections or for different HQS deficiencies, which must be detailed in its Administrative Plan. Upon either an inspection for initial occupancy or a reinspection, the PHA may accept photographic evidence or other reliable evidence from the owner to verify that a deficiency has been corrected.

      (i)  In the case of a PBV project financed under a Federal, State, or local housing program that is subject to an alternative inspection, the PHA may rely upon inspections conducted at least triennially to demonstrate compliance with the alternative inspection option under paragraph (c) of this section or the periodic inspection requirement of paragraph (e) of this section, in accordance with its policy established in the PHA Administrative Plan.

    Subpart D—Requirements for Rehabilitated and Newly Constructed Units

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 38318, May 7, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

      § 983.151   Applicability.

#### § § 983.151

      This subpart applies to development activity, as defined in § 983.3, under the PBV program.

      § 983.152   Nature of development activity.

#### § § 983.152

      (a)  An owner may undertake development activity, as defined at § 983.3, for the purpose of:

      (1) Placing a newly constructed or rehabilitated project under a HAP contract; or

      (2) For a rehabilitated project that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution, completing the requirements of the rider in accordance with § 983.157.

      (b)  Development activity must comply with the requirements of §§ 983.153 through 983.157.

      § 983.153   Development requirements.

#### § § 983.153

      (a)  The development activity must comply with any applicable environmental review requirements at § 983.56.

      (b)  (1) The PHA may provide PBV assistance only in accordance with the HUD subsidy layering regulations (24 CFR 4.13) and other requirements. A subsidy layering review is required when an owner undertakes development activity and housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program is combined with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits. The subsidy layering review is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for the housing by combining (layering) housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits.

      (2) When a subsidy layering review is required, it must occur before a PHA attaches assistance to a project. Specifically, the PHA may not execute an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner until HUD or a housing credit agency approved by HUD has conducted any required subsidy layering review and determined that the PBV assistance is in accordance with HUD subsidy layering requirements.

      (3) A further subsidy layering review is not required if HUD's designee has conducted a review in accordance with HUD's PBV subsidy layering review guidelines and that review included a review of PBV assistance.

      (4) The owner must disclose to the PHA any change to the information provided for purposes of the subsidy layering review, including the amount of assistance or number of units to be developed, that occurs after the subsidy layering review has been conducted and before all contract units are placed under the HAP contract, in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review may be required to determine if such a change would result in excess public assistance to the project, as required by HUD through notification in the .

      (5) The HAP contract must contain the owner's certification that the project has not received and will not receive (before or during the term of the HAP contract) any public assistance for acquisition, development, or operation of the housing other than assistance disclosed in the subsidy layering review in accordance with HUD requirements, unless the owner discloses additional assistance in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review is required for newly constructed or rehabilitated housing under a HAP contract that receives additional assistance, as described in § 983.11(d).

      (6) Existing housing is exempt from subsidy layering requirements.

      (c)  (1) Labor standards as described in paragraphs (c)(2) of this section apply to development activity. When the PHA exercises its discretion at §§ 983.154(f) or 983.157(a) to allow the owner to conduct some or all development activity while the proposed PBV units are not under an Agreement or HAP contract, the applicable parties must comply with the labor standards in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection).

      (2) In the case of development involving nine or more contract units (whether or not completed in stages):

      (i) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must pay Davis-Bacon wages to laborers and mechanics employed in development of the housing; and

      (ii) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must comply with the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5, and other applicable Federal labor relations laws and regulations. The PHA must monitor compliance with labor standards.

      (3) For any project to which labor standards apply, the PHA's written notice to the party that submitted the selected proposal or board resolution approving project-basing of assistance at the specific project, as applicable per § 983.51(f), must state that any construction contracts must incorporate a Davis-Bacon contract clause and the current applicable prevailing wage determination.

      (d)  Development activity is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).

      (e)  As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to development activity. A description of any required work item resulting from these requirements must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(6) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(1).

      (f)  (1) Any development activity that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the development activity while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:

      (i) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;

      (ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

      (iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.

      (2) A description of any required work item resulting from this requirement must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(7) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(2).

      (g)  (1) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in development activity or the rehabilitation of units subject to a HAP contract. Both the Agreement (if applicable) and the HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.

      (2) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the Agreement (if applicable), the HAP contract, or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.

      § 983.154   Development agreement.

#### § § 983.154

      (a)  Except as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, the PHA and owner must enter into an Agreement that will govern development activity. In the Agreement, the owner agrees to develop the contract units to comply with HQS, and the PHA agrees that, upon timely completion of such development activity in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the PHA will enter into an initial HAP contract with the owner for the contract units. The Agreement must cover a single project, except one Agreement may cover multiple projects that each consist of a single-family building.

      (b)  The effective date of the Agreement must be on or after the date the Agreement is executed. The Agreement must be executed and effective prior to the commencement of development activity as described in paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, and must be in the form required by HUD (see 24 CFR 982.162(b)).

      (c)  The PHA and owner may agree to amend the contents of the Agreement described in paragraph (e) of this section by executing an addendum to the Agreement, so long as such amendments are consistent with all requirements of this part 983. The PHA and owner may only execute an addendum affecting a unit prior to the PHA accepting the completed unit.

      (d)  Development activity must not commence after the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection) and before the effective date of the Agreement, except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.

      (1) In the case of new construction, development activity begins with excavation or site preparation (including clearing of the land).

      (2) In the case of rehabilitation, development activity begins with the physical commencement of rehabilitation activity on the housing.

      (e)  At a minimum, the Agreement must describe the following features of the housing to be developed and assisted under the PBV program and development activity to be performed:

      (1) The site;

      (2) The location of contract units on site;

      (3) The number of contract units by area (square footage) and number of bedrooms and bathrooms;

      (4) The services, maintenance, or equipment to be supplied by the owner without charges in addition to the rent to owner;

      (5) The utilities available to the contract units, including a specification of utility services to be paid by the owner (without charges in addition to rent) and utility services to be paid by the tenant;

      (6) A description of any required work item necessary to comply with the accessibility requirements of § 983.153(e);

      (7) A description of any required work item if the requirement at § 983.153(f) to install broadband infrastructure applies;

      (8) Estimated initial rents to owner for the contract units;

      (9) A description of the work to be performed under the Agreement:

      (i) For rehabilitation, the work description must include the rehabilitation work write-up and, where determined necessary by the PHA, specifications and plans (see paragraph (g) of this section for additional requirements that apply under the option for development activity after HAP contract at 983.157); and

      (ii) For new construction, the work description must include the working drawings and specifications;

      (10) The deadline for completion of the work to be performed under the Agreement; and

      (11) Any requirements the PHA elects to establish in addition to HQS for design, architecture, or quality. The PHA must specify the conditions under which it will require additional housing quality requirements in the Administrative Plan.

      (f)  With respect to development activity, the PHA may decide not to use an Agreement or may choose to execute an Agreement after construction or rehabilitation that complied with applicable requirements of § 983.153 has commenced.

      (1) In its Administrative Plan, the PHA must explain the circumstances (if any) under which the PHA will enter a PBV HAP contract for newly constructed or rehabilitated housing without first entering into an Agreement and under which the PHA will enter into an Agreement after construction or rehabilitation that complied with applicable requirements of § 983.153 has commenced.

      (2) The following conditions apply:

      (i) The owner of the project must be able to document its compliance with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection);

      (ii) For housing subject to competitive selection, the PHA must confirm prior to the proposal selection date that the owner has complied with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of proposal submission. For housing excepted from competitive selection, the PHA must confirm prior to executing the Agreement (if applicable) or HAP contract that the owner has complied with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project; and

      (iii) The PHA must comply with the notice requirement of § 983.153(c)(3).

      § 983.155   Completion of work.

#### § § 983.155

      (a)  The owner must submit evidence and certify to the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan, that development activity under § 983.152 or substantial improvement under §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212 has been completed, and that all such work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements. The PHA must review the evidence to determine whether the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements.

      (b)  In the case of PHA-owned units, the owner must submit evidence and certify to the independent entity (see § 983.57(b)(3)), in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan, that development activity under § 983.152 or substantial improvement under §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212 has been completed, and that all such work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements. The independent entity must review the evidence to determine whether the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements.

      § 983.156   PHA acceptance of completed units.

#### § § 983.156

      (a)  After the PHA has received all required evidence of completion and the owner's certification that all work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements, the PHA must inspect the completed units to determine whether they comply with HUD's HQS (see § 983.103(b)) and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA.

      (b)  If the PHA determines that the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements at § 983.155 and the completed units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section, then the PHA must:

      (1) For units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;

      (2) For rehabilitated housing projects for which development activity has commenced prior to HAP contract execution, but which will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution under § 983.157(b), submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;

      (3) For development activity conducted after HAP contract execution, amend the HAP contract rider to designate the completed units as available for occupancy (§ 983.157(f)(1)(ii)) or, if the owner has completed all development activity as provided in the rider, amend the HAP contract to terminate the rider (§ 983.157(d)); or

      (4) For units that underwent substantial improvement in order to be added to the HAP contract, amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (§ 983.207(d)).

      (c)  Contract units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157 may be placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates. In such a case, the PHA must determine separately for each stage whether the development activity was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements per § 983.155 and that the units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section. If the first stage is determined compliant, then the PHA must submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and must execute the HAP contract for PBV rehabilitated housing and newly constructed housing projects. As each subsequent stage is determined compliant, the PHA and owner must amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (see § 983.207(g)).

      (d)  The independent entity must perform the inspection required in paragraph (a) of this section and make the determination(s) required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section in the case of PHA-owned units (see § 983.57(b)(3)).

#### § § 983.204

      (a)  Before execution of the HAP contract, the PHA must determine that applicable pre-HAP contract HQS requirements have been met in accordance with § 983.103(b) or (c) as applicable. The PHA may not execute the HAP contract for any contract unit that does not meet the pre-HAP contract HQS requirements, except as provided in paragraph (c).

      (b)  For existing housing, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after PHA selection of the owner proposal and PHA determination that the applicable pre-HAP contract HQS requirements have been met.

      (c)  For newly constructed or rehabilitated housing developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after the PHA determines that the housing was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements, HUD's HQS, and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA, in accordance with § 983.156(b)(1) or (c). For rehabilitated housing that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after the requirements of § 983.157(c) are met (all proposed PBV units are added to the contract at this time, including units that do not comply with HQS or that will undergo development activity).

      (d)  The effective date of the HAP contract must be on or after the date the HAP contract is executed. The HAP contract must be effective before the effective date of the first lease covering a contract unit occupied by an assisted family, and the PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner until the HAP contract is effective.

      § 983.205   Term of HAP contract.

#### § § 983.205

      (a)  The PHA may enter into a HAP contract with an owner for an initial term of up to 20 years for each contract unit. The length of the term of the HAP contract for any contract unit may not be less than one year, nor more than 20 years.

      (b)  The PHA and owner may agree at any time before expiration of the HAP contract to execute one or more extensions of the HAP contract term. The following conditions apply:

      (1) Each extension executed must have a term that does not exceed 20 years;

      (2) At no time may the total remaining term of the HAP contract, with extensions, exceed 40 years;

      (3) Before agreeing to an extension, the PHA must determine that the extension is appropriate to continue providing affordable housing for low-income families or to expand housing opportunities; and

      (4) Each extension must be on the form and subject to the conditions prescribed by HUD at the time of the extension.

      § 983.206   Contract termination or expiration and statutory notice requirements.

#### § § 983.206

      (a)  (1) Notices required in accordance with this section must be provided in the form prescribed by HUD.

      (2) Not less than one year before termination of a PBV HAP contract, the owner must notify the PHA and assisted tenants of the termination.

      (3) The term “termination” for applicability of this notice requirement means the expiration of the HAP contract, termination of the HAP contract by agreement of PHA and owner per paragraph (e) of this section, or an owner's refusal to renew the HAP contract.

      (4) If an owner fails to provide the required notice, the owner must permit the tenants in assisted units to remain in their units for the required notice period with no increase in the tenant portion of their rent, and with no eviction as a result of an owner's inability to collect an increased tenant portion of rent.

      (5) An owner and PHA may agree to extend the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to provide tenants with the required notice, under such terms as HUD may require.

      (b)  Unless a termination or expiration without extension occurs due to a determination of insufficient funding pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section or other extraordinary circumstances determined by HUD, the PHA shall issue each family occupying a contract unit a tenant-based voucher based on the termination or expiration of the contract no fewer than 60 calendar days prior to the planned termination or expiration of the PBV HAP contract. However, the PHA is not required to issue the family a voucher if the PHA has offered the family an alternative housing option ( an assisted unit in another PBV project), and the family chooses to accept the alternative housing option instead of the voucher. Such a family is not a new admission to the tenant-based program and shall not count toward the PHA's income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i). The voucher issued to the family is the voucher attached to its unit under the expiring or terminating PBV contract. Consequently, if the family vacates the contract unit following the issuance of the tenant-based voucher and prior to the contract termination or expiration date, the PHA must remove the unit from the PBV HAP contract at the time the family vacates the unit. The PBV HAP contract must provide that, if the units continue to be used for rental housing upon termination or expiration without extension of a PBV HAP contract, each assisted family may elect to use its tenant-based assistance to remain in the same project, subject to the following:

      (1) The unit must comply with HUD's HQS;

      (2) The PHA must determine or have determined that the rent for the unit is reasonable;

      (3) The family must pay its required share of the rent and the amount, if any, by which the unit rent (including the amount allowed for tenant-based utilities) exceeds the applicable payment standard (the limitation at 24 CFR 982.508 regarding maximum family share at initial occupancy shall not apply); and

      (4) The owner may not refuse to initially lease a unit in the project to a family that elects to use their tenant-based assistance to remain in the same project, except where the owner will use the unit for a purpose other than a residential rental unit. The owner may not later terminate the tenancy of such a family, except for the following grounds:

      (i) The grounds in 24 CFR 982.310 of this title, except paragraphs 24 CFR 982.310(d)(1)(iii) and (iv);

      (ii) The owner's desire to use the unit for a purpose other than a residential rental unit; and

      (iii) The owner's desire to renovate the unit, subject to the following:

      (A) The owner must consider whether a reasonable alternative to terminating the lease exists. If a reasonable alternative exists, the owner must not terminate the lease. The owner must consider the following alternatives:

      () Completing renovations without the family vacating the unit, if the renovations can be completed in a manner that does not result in life-threatening conditions, does not result in deficiencies under HQS that are not corrected within 30 days, and is mutually agreeable to the owner and the family; and

      () Temporarily relocating the family to complete the renovations, if the relocation and renovations can be completed within a single calendar month (beginning no sooner than the first day of a month and ending no later than the last day of the same month) and the family can be relocated to a location and in a manner mutually agreeable to the owner and the family;

      (B) If the owner terminates the lease for renovation, the owner must make every reasonable effort to make available and lease the family another unit within the project that meets the tenant-based voucher program requirements; and

      (C) If no other unit within the project is available for the family to lease during the renovation period or the family chooses to move from the project during the renovation period, the owner must make every reasonable effort to make available and lease the family a unit within the project upon completion of renovations.

      (c)  (1) The HAP contract must provide that the PHA may terminate the contract for insufficient funding, subject to HUD requirements.

      (i) Consistent with the policies in the PHA's Administrative Plan, the PHA has the option of terminating a PBV HAP contract based on “insufficient funding” only if:

      (A) The PHA determines in accordance with HUD requirements that it lacks sufficient HAP funding (including HAP reserves) to continue to make housing assistance payments for all voucher units currently under a HAP contract;

      (B) The PHA has taken cost-saving measures specified by HUD;

      (C) The PHA notifies HUD of its determination and provides the information required by HUD; and

      (D) HUD determines that the PHA lacks sufficient funding and notifies the PHA it may terminate HAP contracts as a result.

      (2) If the PHA determines that the owner has breached the HAP contract, the PHA may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the HAP contract, including but not limited to contract termination. The provisions of § 983.208 apply for HAP contract breaches involving failure to comply with HQS. For any other contract termination due to breach, paragraph (b) of this section on provision of tenant-based assistance applies.

      (d)  If the amount of the rent to owner for any contract unit, as adjusted in accordance with § 983.302, is reduced below the amount of the initial rent to owner, the owner may terminate the HAP contract, upon notice to the PHA no fewer than 90 calendar days prior to the planned termination, and families must be provided tenant-based assistance and may elect to remain in the project in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The owner is not required to provide the one-year notice of the termination of the HAP contract to the family and the PHA, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, when terminating the HAP contract due to rent reduction below the initial rent to owner.

      (e)  The PHA and owner may agree to terminate the HAP contract prior to the end of the term. The owner's notice in paragraph (a) of this section is required prior to termination, and the families must be provided tenant-based assistance and may elect to remain in the project in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      § 983.207   HAP contract amendments (to add or substitute contract units).

#### § § 983.207

      (a)  At the discretion of the PHA, the PHA and owner may execute an amendment to the HAP contract to substitute a different unit with the same number of bedrooms in the same project for a previously covered contract unit. Prior to such substitution, the PHA must inspect the proposed substitute unit (the unit must comply with HQS to be substituted) and must determine the reasonable rent for such unit (the rent to owner must be reasonable for the unit to be substituted). The proposed substituted unit may be vacant or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, it may be occupied. The proposed substituted unit may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to substitute the unit, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The proposed substituted unit must have existed at the time described in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (b)  At the discretion of the PHA, and provided that the total number of units in a project that will receive PBV assistance will not exceed the limitations in § 983.6 or § 983.54, the PHA and owner may execute an amendment to the HAP contract to add PBV units in the same project to the contract, without a new proposal selection. Prior to such addition, the PHA must inspect the proposed added unit (the unit must comply with HQS to be added) and must determine the reasonable rent for such unit (the rent to owner must be reasonable for the unit to be added).

      (1) Added units that qualify for an exclusion from the program cap (as described in § 983.59) or an exception to or exclusion from the project cap (as described in § 983.54(c) and § 983.59, respectively) will not count toward such cap(s).

      (2) The anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract for the additional units must be the same as the anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract term for the PBV units originally placed under HAP contract.

      (3) The added unit may be vacant or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, it may be occupied.

      (4) The unit may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to add the unit, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (5) The added unit must have existed at the time described in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (c)  The PHA may place occupied units on the HAP contract under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, subject to the following:

      (1) The family occupying the unit must be eligible for assistance per §§ 983.53(a)(3) and 983.251(a);

      (2) The unit must be appropriate for the size of the family occupying the unit under the PHA's subsidy standards;

      (3) The family must be selected from the waiting list in accordance with the applicable selection policies; and

      (4) The unit may be occupied by a family who was assisted with a tenant-based voucher immediately prior to the unit being placed on the PBV HAP contract. The tenant-based HAP contract for the unit must terminate before the unit may be placed under the PBV HAP contract. The family occupying the unit is not a new admission to the voucher program. The option described in this paragraph (c)(4) is subject to the following conditions:

      (i) If the family is in the initial term of the tenant-based lease, the family agreed to mutually terminate the tenant-based lease with the owner and enter into a PBV lease.

      (ii) If the initial term of the tenant-based lease has passed or the end of that term coincides with the time at which the unit will be placed on the PBV HAP contract, upon the owner's decision not to renew the tenant-based lease or to terminate the tenant-based lease in accordance with 24 CFR 982.308 or 982.310, respectively, the family agreed to relinquish the tenant-based voucher and enter into a PBV lease.

      (d)  A unit that is not under a HAP contract but is in a project with other units that are under a HAP contract may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to add or substitute the unit, except in the case of a contract subject to a rider under the rehabilitated housing option for development activity after HAP contract execution in accordance with § 983.157. If such repairs or renovation constitute substantial improvement as defined in § 983.3, then:

      (1) The substantial improvement must not proceed prior to the first two years of the effective date of the HAP contract, except in extraordinary circumstances ( the units were damaged by fire, natural disaster, etc.).

      (2) The substantial improvement is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).

      (3) As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to substantial improvement.

      (4) Any substantial improvement that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the substantial improvement while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:

      (i) The location of the substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;

      (ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

      (iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.

      (5) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in substantial improvement. The HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.

      (6) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the HAP contract or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.

      (7) The requirements for additional assistance after HAP contract at § 983.11(d) apply.

      (8) Section 983.155, Completion of work, applies.

      (9) Paragraphs (a), (b)(4), and (d) of § 983.156, PHA acceptance of completed units, apply.

      (e)  Units may only be added to the HAP contract or substituted for a previously covered contract unit if one of the following conditions applies:

      (1) The units to be added or substituted existed at the time of HAP contract execution;

      (2) In the case of a project completed in stages, the units to be added or substituted existed at the time of PHA acceptance of the last completed unit(s) per § 983.156(c); or

      (3) A unit, office space, or common area within the interior of a building containing contract units existed at the time described in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, and is reconfigured without impacting the building envelope, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, into one or more units to be added or substituted.

      (f)  The PHA must describe in the Administrative Plan the circumstances under which it will add or substitute contract units, and how those circumstances support the goals of the PBV program.

      (g)  Even if contract units are placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates, there is a single annual anniversary for all contract units under the HAP contract. The annual anniversary for all contract units is the annual anniversary date for the first contract units placed under the HAP contract. The expiration of the HAP contract for all the contract units completed in stages must be concurrent with the end of the HAP contract term for the units originally placed under HAP contract.

      (h)  HUD may establish a process allowing the PHA and owner to agree to merge two or more HAP contracts for PBV assistance on the same project, or to bifurcate a HAP contract, by  notice subject to public comment.

      § 983.208   Condition of contract units.

#### § § 983.208

      (a) Owner maintenance and operation. (1) The owner must maintain and operate the contract units and premises in accordance with the HQS, including performance of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance.

      (2) The owner must provide all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities specified in the HAP contract with the PHA and in the lease with each assisted family.

      (3) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may also require continuing owner compliance during the HAP contract term with additional housing quality requirements specified by the PHA (in addition to, but not in place of, compliance with HUD's HQS). Such additional requirements may be designed to assure continued compliance with any design, architecture, or quality requirement specified by the PHA (§ 983.204(c)). The PHA must specify the conditions under which it will require additional housing quality requirements in the Administrative Plan.

      (b)  (1) The PHA must vigorously enforce the owner's obligation to maintain contract units in accordance with HUD's HQS. If the owner fails to maintain the dwelling unit in accordance with HQS, the PHA must take enforcement action in accordance with this section.

      (2) The unit is in noncompliance with HQS if:

      (i) The PHA or other inspector authorized by the State or local government determines the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection;

      (ii) The agency or inspector notifies the owner in writing of the unit HQS deficiencies; and

      (iii) The unit HQS deficiencies are not remedied within the following timeframes:

      (A) For life-threatening deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification.

      (B) For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days of notification (or any reasonable PHA-approved extension).

      (3) In the case of an HQS deficiency that the PHA determines is caused by the tenant, any member of the household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, other than any damage resulting from ordinary use, the PHA may waive the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation. Housing assistance payments to the owner may not be withheld or abated if the owner responsibility has been waived. However, the PHA may terminate assistance to a family because of an HQS breach beyond damage resulting from ordinary use caused by any member of the household or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, which may result in removing the unit from the HAP contract.

      (4) In the case of an HQS deficiency that is caused by fire, natural disaster, or similar extraordinary circumstances, the PHA may permit the owner to undertake substantial improvement in accordance with § 983.212. However, so long as the contract unit with deficiencies is occupied, the PHA must withhold or abate housing assistance payments and remove units from or terminate the HAP contract as described in this section.

      (5) In the case of a project that is undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the remedies of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to units designated as unavailable for occupancy during the period of development activity in accordance with the rider. However, in the case of any contract unit with deficiencies that is occupied, the PHA must withhold or abate housing assistance payments and remove units from or terminate the HAP contract as described in this section.

      (c)  (1) The family may be held responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:

      (i) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the owner is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the tenant;

      (ii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the owner is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the tenant; or

      (iii) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear).

      (2) If the PHA has waived the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the following applies:

      (i) If the HQS breach caused by the family is life-threatening, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 24 hours of notification.

      (ii) For other family-caused deficiencies, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 30 calendar days of notification (or any PHA-approved extension).

      (3) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for the family in accordance with 24 CFR 982.552.

      (d)  These remedies apply when HQS deficiencies are identified as the result of an inspection other than a pre-selection, initial, or turnover inspection. (See § 983.103 generally, and see § 983.103(c) in particular for PHA enforcement actions related to the initial HQS inspection for existing housing). The PHA must identify in its Administrative Plan the conditions under which it will withhold HAP and the conditions under which it will abate HAP or terminate the HAP contract for units other than the unit with HQS deficiencies.

      (1) A PHA may withhold HAP for an individual unit that has HQS deficiencies once the PHA has notified the owner in writing of the deficiencies. If the unit is brought into compliance during the applicable cure period (within 24 hours from notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days from notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA for non-life-threatening deficiencies), the PHA:

      (i) Must resume assistance payments; and

      (ii) Must provide assistance payments to cover the time period for which the assistance payments were withheld.

      (2)(i) The PHA must abate the HAP, including amounts that had been withheld, for the PBV unit with deficiencies if the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable cure period (within 24 hours from notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days from notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies).

      (ii) The PHA may choose to abate payments for all units covered by the HAP contract due to a contract unit's noncompliance with the HQS, even if some of the contract units continue to meet HQS.

      (iii) If a PHA abates the HAP for a unit, the PHA must notify the family and the owner that it is abating payments and that if the unit with deficiencies does not meet HQS within 60 days after the determination of noncompliance (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA), the PHA will either terminate the HAP contract or remove the unit with deficiencies from the HAP contract, and any family residing in a unit that does not comply with HQS will have to move if the family wishes to receive continued assistance.

      (3) An owner may not terminate the tenancy of any family due to the withholding or abatement of assistance. During the period that assistance is abated, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner. The PHA must promptly issue the family a tenant-based voucher to move.

      (4) If the owner makes the repairs and the unit complies with HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner if the unit is still occupied by an assisted family. The PHA does not make any payments for the unit to the owner for the period of time that the payments were abated.

      (5) If the owner fails to make the repairs within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must either remove the unit from the HAP contract or terminate the HAP contract in its entirety. The PHA must issue the family whose unit will be removed or all families residing in contract units, if the PHA is terminating the HAP contract, a tenant-based voucher to move at least 30 days prior to the removal of the unit from the HAP contract or termination of the HAP contract. A family may elect to remain in the project in accordance with § 983.206(b) if the project contains a unit that meets the requirements of that section, with priority given to families who will remain in the same unit if there are insufficient units available to accommodate all families that wish to remain.

      (6)(i) The PHA must give any family residing in a unit that is either removed from the HAP contract or for which the HAP contract is terminated under this paragraph (d) due to a failure to correct HQS deficiencies at least 90 days or a longer period as the PHA determines is reasonably necessary following the termination of the HAP contract or removal of the unit from the HAP contract to lease a unit with tenant-based assistance.

      (ii) If the family is unable to lease a new unit within the period provided by the PHA under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section and the PHA owns or operates public housing, the PHA must offer, and, if accepted, provide the family a selection preference for an appropriate-size public housing unit that first becomes available for occupancy after the time period expires.

      (iii) PHAs may assist families relocating under this paragraph (d) in finding a new unit, including using up to 2 months of the withheld and abated assistance payments for costs directly associated with relocating to a new unit, including security deposits, temporary housing costs, or other reasonable moving costs as determined by the PHA based on their locality. PHAs must assist families with disabilities in locating available accessible units in accordance with 24 CFR 8.28(a)(3). If the PHA uses the withheld and abated assistance payments to assist with the family's relocation costs, the PHA must provide security deposit assistance to the family as necessary. If the family receives security deposit assistance from the PHA for the new unit, the PHA may require the family to remit the security deposit returned by the owner of the new unit at such time that the lease is terminated, up to the amount of the security deposit assistance provided by the PHA for that unit. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the policies it will implement for this provision.

      (e)  Maintenance and replacement (including redecoration) must be in accordance with the standard practice for the building concerned as established by the owner.

      (f)  This section is applicable to HAP contracts executed on or after or extended on or after June 6, 2024. For purposes of this paragraph, a HAP contract is extended the earlier of the effective date of the next extension period or the date the PHA and owner agree to the next extension. For all other HAP contracts, § 983.208 as in effect on June 5, 2024 remains applicable. However, the PHA and owner may agree to apply this section to a HAP contract executed before June 6, 2024 prior to extension.

#### § § 983.210

      By execution of the HAP contract, the owner certifies that at such execution and at all times during the term of the HAP contract:

      (a) The owner is maintaining the premises and all contract units in accordance with HUD's HQS under the requirements of this part 983.

      (b) The owner is providing all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities as agreed to under the HAP contract and the leases with assisted families.

      (c) Each contract unit for which the owner is receiving housing assistance payments is leased to an eligible family referred by the PHA or selected from the owner-maintained waiting list in accordance with § 983.251, and the lease is in accordance with the HAP contract and HUD requirements.

      (d) To the best of the owner's knowledge, the members of the family reside in each contract unit for which the owner is receiving housing assistance payments, and the unit is the family's only residence, except as provided in §§ 983.157(g)(6)(ii) and 983.212(a)(3)(ii).

      (e) The owner (including a principal or other interested party) is not the spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of a family residing in a contract unit unless needed as a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities.

      (f) The amount of the housing assistance payment is the correct amount due under the HAP contract.

      (g) The rent to owner for each contract unit does not exceed rents charged by the owner for other comparable unassisted units.

      (h) Except for the housing assistance payment and the tenant rent as provided under the HAP contract, the owner has not received and will not receive any payment or other consideration (from the family, the PHA, HUD, or any other public or private source) for rental of the contract unit.

      (i) The family does not own or have any interest in the contract unit. The certification required by this section does not apply in the case of an assisted family's membership in a cooperative.

      § 983.211   Removal of unit from HAP contract based on a family's increased income.

#### § § 983.211

      (a)  Units occupied by families whose income has increased during their tenancy resulting in the total tenant payment equaling the gross rent shall be removed from the HAP contract 180 days following the last housing assistance payment on behalf of the family.

      (b)  If the project is fully assisted, a PHA may reinstate the unit removed under  of this section to the HAP contract after the ineligible family vacates the property. If the project is partially assisted, a PHA may substitute a different unit for the unit removed under  of this section to the HAP contract when the first eligible substitute becomes available. A reinstatement or substitution of units under the HAP contract, in accordance with this paragraph, must be permissible under § 983.207(b) or (a), respectively.

      (c)  The anniversary and expirations dates of the reinstated or substituted unit must be the same as all other units under the HAP contract ( the annual anniversary and expiration dates for the first contract units placed under the HAP contract). Families must be selected in accordance with program requirements under § 983.251 of this part.

      § 983.212   Substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract.

#### § § 983.212

      (a)  The owner may undertake substantial improvement on a unit currently under a HAP contract, except a contract subject to a rider under the rehabilitated housing option for development activity after HAP contract execution in accordance with § 983.157, if approved to do so by the PHA. The owner may request PHA approval no earlier than the effective date of the HAP contract. The following conditions apply:

      (1) The PHA may approve the substantial improvement only if one of the following conditions apply:

      (i) The unit has been damaged by fire or natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances exist which require a unit previously compliant with HQS to urgently undergo substantial improvement. For this purpose, “extraordinary circumstances” are unforeseen events that are not the fault of the owner. The PHA may provide approval for substantial improvement resulting from the damage or extraordinary circumstances described in this paragraph (a)(1)(i) after the owner submits the request.

      (ii) The owner requests to engage in substantial improvement that will commence following the first two years of the effective date of the HAP contract. The PHA may provide approval for substantial improvement occurring as described in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) after the owner submits the request, but no earlier than twenty-one months after the effective date of the HAP contract.

      (2) The owner's request must include a description of the substantial improvement proposed to be undertaken and the length of time, if any, the owner anticipates that the unit, including items and components within the primary and secondary means of egress, common features, and systems equipment as described by 24 CFR 5.703(a)(2), will not meet HQS. The PHA must not approve as substantial improvement, under this section, an owner's request to demolish a building containing contract units and newly construct replacement units (see requirements for contract termination at § 983.206 and requirements for newly constructed housing in this part 983).

      (3) If the unit is occupied and will not meet HQS during any part of the period of the substantial improvement, the owner's request must include a description of the owner's plan to house the family during the period the unit will not meet HQS. The PHA must not approve the substantial improvement unless the owner's plan complies with one of the following requirements:

      (i) The owner must complete the substantial improvement without the family vacating the unit if the PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the substantial improvement in a manner that:

      (A) Does not result in life-threatening deficiencies;

      (B) Does not result in any other deficiencies under the HQS that are not corrected within 30 days; and

      (C) Is mutually agreeable to the owner and the family;

      (ii) If the conditions for in-place substantial improvement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section cannot be achieved, the owner must temporarily relocate the family to complete the substantial improvement if:

      (A) The PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the relocation and substantial improvement within a single calendar month (beginning no sooner than the first day of a month and ending no later than the last day of the same month); and

      (B) The family can be relocated to a location and in a manner mutually agreeable to the owner and the family; and

      (iii) If the conditions for in-place substantial improvement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and temporary relocation in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section cannot be achieved, the following protocol for lease termination and relocation applies:

      (A) If there are contract units within the project will meet HQS during the period of substantial improvement and that are vacant or expected to become vacant at the time of the planned lease termination, the PHA must refer the family to the owner for occupancy of an appropriate-size contract unit. If the family accepts the offered unit, the owner must provide the family with a reasonable time to move to the offered unit, must pay the family's reasonable moving expenses, must execute a lease with the family for the offered unit to be effective at the time of the family's move, and must terminate the lease for the family's original unit at the time of the family's move. The owner must terminate the family's lease if the family rejects the offered unit; however, the PHA must first offer the family a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section if needed as a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities. The PHA must consider other family requests for a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section;

      (B) If no other contract unit within the project is available for the family to lease during the period of substantial improvement, the PHA must issue the family a tenant-based voucher. However, the PHA is not required to issue the family a voucher if the PHA has offered the family an alternative housing option ( an assisted unit in another PBV project), and the family chooses to accept the alternative housing option instead of the voucher. The PHA may also issue the family a tenant-based voucher to accommodate the family's need or request as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. The PHA must issue the voucher no fewer than 90 calendar days prior to the planned lease termination in the case of substantial improvement pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The PHA must issue the voucher as soon as practicable in the case of substantial improvement pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. If the family is eligible and willing to request a voucher to move in accordance with § 983.261, the PHA must issue the family the voucher to move under that section. If the family is not eligible or is unwilling to request a voucher to move under § 983.261, the PHA must remove the family's unit from the PBV HAP contract and issue the family its voucher to move with tenant-based assistance and subsequently add a unit back to the PBV HAP contract at such time that the unit is ready for occupancy. The PHA must extend the voucher term until the family either leases a unit with the tenant-based voucher or accepts a contract unit, whichever occurs first; and

      (C) If the family moves from the project during the period of substantial improvement, the PHA must offer the family the option to return to the project with PBV assistance, if the family is eligible for PBV assistance, following completion of substantial improvement at the project. The PHA, or owner in the case of an absolute selection preference for occupancy in the project.

      (4) The PHA must abate housing assistance payments for a unit beginning at the time the unit has any deficiency under HUD's HQS during the period of substantial improvement. The timing for the PHA to begin withholding and abatement specified in § 983.208(d) does not apply to deficiencies occurring during the period of substantial improvement. When all deficiencies in the unit are corrected, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner if the unit is still occupied by an assisted family, subject to paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(1) of this section. Additionally, the PHA must not pay vacancy payments during the period of substantial improvement.

      (5) The terms of the PHA approval must be recorded in an addendum to the HAP contract. The PHA may choose to temporarily remove vacant units from the PBV HAP contract during the time the units will not meet HQS during the substantial improvement. If the PHA temporarily removes a unit, the PHA reinstates the unit in accordance with § 983.207(b). Owner failure to complete the substantial improvement as approved shall be a breach of the HAP contract and the PHA may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the HAP contract, including but not limited to contract termination pursuant to § 983.206(c)(2).

      (b)  (1) Substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).

      (2) As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.

      (3) Any substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the substantial improvement while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:

      (i) The location of the substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;

      (ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

      (iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.

      (4) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in substantial improvement undertaken on units subject to a HAP contract. The HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.

      (5) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the HAP contract or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.

      (6) The requirements for additional assistance after HAP contract at § 983.11(d) apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.

      (7) Section 983.155, Completion of work, applies to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.

      (8) Section 983.156(a), Inspection of units, and (d), PHA-owned units, apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.

      (c)  For PHA-owned units, the independent entity must determine whether to approve the PHA proposal to undertake substantial improvement as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, including making the determinations in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii)(A) when the owner will undertake substantial improvement in a unit currently occupied by an assisted family, as applicable (see § 983.57(b)(4)). The independent entity must approve the proposal if:

      (1) The proposed substantial improvement meets one of the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

      (2) The description of the substantial improvement does not include plans to demolish a building containing contract units and newly construct replacement units; and

      (3) The plan to house each family during the period that family's unit will not meet HQS complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3).

    Subpart F—Occupancy

      § 983.251   How participants are selected.

#### § § 983.251

      (a) Who may receive PBV assistance? (1) The PHA may select families who are participants in the PHA's tenant-based voucher program and families who have applied for admission to the voucher program.

      (2) Except for voucher participants (determined eligible at original admission to the voucher program), the PHA may only select families determined eligible for admission at commencement of PBV assistance, using information received and verified by the PHA within a period of 60 days before commencement of PBV assistance. For all families, the PHA must determine the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP.

      (3) The protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to admission to the project-based program.

      (4) A PHA may not approve a tenancy if the owner (including a principal or other interested party) of a unit is the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of the family, unless the PHA determines that approving the unit would provide reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities.

      (b)  (1) To minimize displacement of in-place families, if an in-place family is determined to be eligible prior to placement of the family's unit on the HAP contract, the in-place family must be placed on the PBV waiting list (if the family is not already on the list) and given an absolute selection preference. If the PHA's waiting list for PBV assistance is not a project-specific waiting list, the PHA must refer the family to the applicable project owner for an appropriate-size PBV unit in the specific project.

      (2) If the in-place family is a tenant-based voucher participant, program eligibility is not re-determined. However, the PHA must determine that the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent for the unit, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP, and the PHA may deny or terminate assistance for the grounds specified in 24 CFR 982.552 and 982.553.

      (3)(i) During the initial term of the lease under the tenant-based tenancy, an in-place tenant-based voucher family may agree, but is not required, to mutually terminate the lease with the owner and enter into a lease and tenancy under the PBV program. If the family chooses to continue the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the unit may not be added to the PBV HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the lease for other good cause during the initial term unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do in accordance with 24 CFR 982.310(d)(2). The owner is expressly prohibited from terminating the tenancy during the initial term of the lease based on the family's failure to accept the offer of a new lease or revision, or for a business or economic reason.

      (ii) If, after the initial term, the owner chooses not to renew the lease or terminates the lease for other good cause (as defined in 24 CFR 982.310(d)) to end the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the family would be required to move with continued tenant-based assistance or relinquish the tenant-based voucher and enter into a new lease to receive PBV assistance in order to remain in the unit.

      (4) Admission of in-place families is not subject to income-targeting under 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i).

      (c)  (1) Applicants who will occupy PBV units must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program.

      (2) The PHA must identify in the Administrative Plan which of the following options it will use to structure the waiting list for the PBV program:

      (i) The PHA may use a separate, central, waiting list comprised of more than one, or all, PBV projects;

      (ii) The PHA may use the same waiting list for both tenant-based assistance and some or all PBV projects; or

      (iii) The PHA may use separate waiting lists for PBV units in individual projects or buildings (or for sets of such units). This option may be used in combination with the option in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. The PHA must specify the name of the PBV project in the Administrative Plan. The PHA may permit the owner to maintain such waiting lists (see paragraph (c)(7) of this section for more information).

      (3) For any of the options under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PHA may establish in its Administrative Plan any preferences for occupancy of particular units including the name of the project(s) and the specific preferences that are to be used by project. Criteria for occupancy of units ( elderly families) may also be established; however, selection of families must be done through an admissions preference.

      (4) The PHA may merge the waiting list for PBV assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program.

      (5) Where applicable, the PHA may place families referred by the PBV owner on its PBV waiting list.

      (6) If the PHA chooses to use a separate waiting list for admission to PBV units under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, the PHA must offer to place applicants who are listed on the waiting list for tenant-based assistance on the waiting list for PBV assistance (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists).

      (7) PHAs using separate waiting lists for individual projects or buildings, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, may establish in their Administrative Plan that owners will maintain such waiting lists. PHAs may choose to use owner-maintained PBV waiting lists for specific owners or projects. PHAs may permit an owner to maintain a single waiting list across multiple projects owned by the owner. Under an owner-maintained waiting list, the owner is responsible for carrying out responsibilities including, but not limited to, processing changes in applicant information, removing an applicant's name from the waiting list, opening and closing the waiting list. PHAs must identify in their Administrative Plans the name of the project(s), the oversight procedures the PHA will use to ensure owner-maintained waiting lists are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, and the approval process of an owner's waiting list policy (including any preferences). Where a PHA allows for owner-maintained waiting lists, all the following apply:

      (i) The owner must develop and submit a written owner waiting list policy to the PHA for approval. The owner waiting list policy must include policies and procedures concerning waiting list management and selection of applicants from the project's waiting list, including any admission preferences, procedures for removing applicant names from the waiting list, and procedures for closing and reopening the waiting list. The owner must receive approval from the PHA of its owner waiting list policy in accordance with the process established in the PHA's Administrative Plan. The owner's waiting list policy must be incorporated in the PHA's Administrative Plan.

      (ii) The owner must receive approval from the PHA for any preferences that will be applicable to the project. The PHA will approve such preferences as part of its approval of the owner's waiting list policy. Each project may have a different set of preferences. Preferences must be consistent with the PHA Plan and listed in the owner's waiting list policy.

      (iii) The owner is responsible for opening and closing the waiting list, including providing public notice when the owner opens the waiting list in accordance with 24 CFR 982.206. If the owner-maintained waiting list is open and additional applicants are needed to fill vacant units, the owner must give public notice in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 982.206 and the owner waiting list policy.

      (iv) The applicant may apply directly at the project, or the applicant may request that the PHA refer the applicant to the owner for placement on the project's waiting list. The PHA must disclose to the applicant all the PBV projects available to the applicant, including the projects' contact information and other basic information about the project.

      (v) Applicants already on the PHA's waiting list must be permitted to place their names on the project's waiting lists.

      (vi) At the discretion of the PHA, the owner may make preliminary eligibility determinations for purposes of placing the family on the waiting list, and preference eligibility determinations. The PHA may choose to make this determination rather than delegating it to the owner.

      (vii) If the PHA delegated the preliminary eligibility and preference determinations to the owner, the owner is responsible for notifying the family of the owner's determination not to place the applicant on the waiting list and a determination that the family is not eligible for a preference. In such a case, the owner is responsible to provide the notice at 24 CFR 982.554(a) of this title. The PHA is then responsible for conducting the informal review.

      (viii) Once an owner selects the family from the waiting list, the owner refers the family to the PHA who then determines the family's final program eligibility. The owner may not offer a unit to the family until the PHA determines that the family is eligible for the program.

      (ix) All HCV waiting list administration requirements that apply to the PBV program (24 CFR part 982, subpart E, other than 24 CFR 982.201(e), 982.202(b)(2), and 982.204(d)) apply to owner-maintained waiting lists.

      (x) The PHA is responsible for oversight of owner-maintained waiting lists to ensure that they are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, including but not limited to nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements under the authorities cited at 24 CFR 5.105(a). The owner is responsible for maintaining complete and accurate records as described in 24 CFR 982.158. The owner must give the PHA, HUD, and the Comptroller General full and free access to its offices and records concerning waiting list management, as described in 24 CFR 982.158(c). HUD may undertake investigation to determine whether the PHA or owner is in violation of authorities and, if unable to reach a voluntary resolution to correct the violation, take an enforcement action against either the owner or the PHA, or both.

      (8) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based and project-based voucher programs during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low-income families. The income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2) apply to the total of admissions to the PHA's project-based voucher program and tenant-based voucher program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists) for such programs.

      (9) Families who require particular accessibility features for persons with disabilities must be selected first to occupy PBV units with such accessibility features (see 24 CFR 8.26, 8.27, and 100.202). Also see § 983.260. The PHA shall have some mechanism for referring to accessible PBV units a family that includes a person with a mobility or sensory impairment.

      (d)  In selecting families, PHAs (or owners in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) may give preference to families who qualify for voluntary services, including disability-specific services, offered at a particular project, consistent with the PHA Plan and Administrative Plan.

      (1) The prohibition on granting preferences to persons with a specific disability at 24 CFR 982.207(b)(3) continues to apply.

      (2) Families must not be required to accept the particular services offered at the project nor shall families be required to provide their own equivalent services if they decline the project's services.

      (3) In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the preference must be provided to all applicants who qualify for the voluntary services offered in conjunction with the assisted units.

      (e)  (1) If a family refuses the PHA's offer of PBV assistance or the owner rejects a family for admission to the owner's PBV units, the family's position on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance is not affected regardless of the type of PBV waiting list used by the PHA.

      (2) The impact (of a family's rejection of the offer or the owner's rejection of the family) on a family's position on the PBV waiting list will be determined as follows:

      (i) If a central PBV waiting list is used, the PHA's Administrative Plan must address the number of offers a family may reject without good cause before the family is removed from the PBV waiting list and whether the owner's rejection will impact the family's place on the PBV waiting list.

      (ii) If a project-specific PBV waiting list is used, the family's name is removed from the project's waiting list connected to the family's rejection of the offer without good cause or the owner's rejection of the family. The family's position on any other project-specific PBV waiting list is not affected.

      (iii) The PHA must define “good cause” for purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section in its Administrative Plan. The PHA's definition of good cause must include, at minimum, that:

      (A) The family determines the unit is not accessible to a household member with a disability or otherwise does not meet the member's disability-related needs;

      (B) The unit has HQS deficiencies;

      (C) The family is unable to accept the offer due to circumstances beyond the family's control (such as hospitalization, temporary economic hardship, or natural disaster); and

      (D) The family determines the unit presents a health or safety risk to a household member who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in part 5, subpart L of this title.

      (3) None of the following actions may be taken against an applicant solely because the applicant has applied for, received, or refused an offer of PBV assistance:

      (i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance or any other available PBV waiting list. However, the PHA (or owner in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) is not required to open a closed waiting list to place the family on that waiting list.

      (ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified.

      (iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date, and time of application, or other factors affecting selection from the waiting list.

      (iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list for tenant-based voucher assistance.

      § 983.253   Leasing of contract units.

#### § § 983.253

      (a)  (1) During the term of the HAP contract, the owner must lease contract units only to eligible families selected from the waiting list for the PBV program in accordance with § 983.251 of this part.

      (2) The owner is responsible for adopting written tenant selection procedures that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income families and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the lease obligations.

      (3) An owner must promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. The owner must provide a copy of such rejection notice to the PHA.

      (4) The owner must comply with 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).

      (b)  The contract unit leased to each family must be appropriate for the size of the family under the PHA's subsidy standards.

      § 983.254   Vacancies.

#### § § 983.254

However, contract units in a rehabilitated housing project undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution that are not available for occupancy in accordance with § 983.157(e)(5) are not subject to this requirement.

      (i) If an owner-maintained waiting list is used, in accordance with § 983.251, the owner must promptly notify the PHA of any vacancy or expected vacancy in a contract unit and refer the family to the PHA for final eligibility determination. The PHA must make every reasonable effort to make such final eligibility determination within 30 calendar days.

      (ii) If a PHA-maintained waiting list is used, in accordance with § 983.251, the owner must promptly notify the PHA of any vacancy or expected vacancy in a contract unit, and the PHA must, after receiving the owner notice, make every reasonable effort to promptly refer a sufficient number of families for the owner to fill such vacancies within 30 calendar days.

      (2) The owner must lease vacant contract units only to families determined eligible by the PHA.

      (b)  If any contract units have been vacant for a period of 120 days or more since owner notice of vacancy, as required in paragraph (a) of this section, and notwithstanding the reasonable good-faith efforts of the PHA and the owner to fill such vacancies, the PHA may give notice to the owner amending the HAP contract to reduce the number of contract units by subtracting the number of contract units (by number of bedrooms) that have been vacant for such period.

      § 983.255   Tenant screening.

#### § § 983.255

      (a)  (1) The PHA has no responsibility or liability to the owner or any other person for the family's behavior or suitability for tenancy. However, the PHA may opt to screen applicants for family behavior or suitability for tenancy and may deny admission to an applicant based on such screening.

      (2) The PHA must conduct tenant screening of applicants in accordance with policies stated in the PHA Administrative Plan.

      (b)  (1) The owner is responsible for screening and selection of the family to occupy the owner's unit.

      (2) The owner is responsible for screening of families on the basis of their tenancy histories. An owner may consider a family's background with respect to such factors as:

      (i) Payment of rent and utility bills;

      (ii) Caring for a unit and premises;

      (iii) Respecting the rights of other residents to the peaceful enjoyment of their housing;

      (iv) Drug-related criminal activity or other criminal activity that is a threat to the health, safety, or property of others; and

      (v) Compliance with other essential conditions of tenancy;

      (c)  (1) The PHA must give the owner:

      (i) The family's current and prior address (as shown in the PHA records); and

      (ii) The name and address (if known to the PHA) of the landlord at the family's current and any prior address.

      (2) When a family wants to lease a dwelling unit, the PHA may offer the owner other information in the PHA possession about the family, including information about the tenancy history of family members or about drug trafficking and criminal activity by family members.

      (3) The PHA must give the family a description of the PHA policy on providing information to owners.

      (4) The PHA policy must be stated in the Administrative Plan and provide that the PHA will give the same types of information to all owners.

      (d) The protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to tenant screening.

      § 983.256   Lease.

#### § § 983.256

      (a)  The tenant must have legal capacity to enter a lease under state and local law. “Legal capacity” means that the tenant is bound by the terms of the lease and may enforce the terms of the lease against the owner.

      (b)  (1) The tenant and the owner must enter a written lease for the unit. The lease must be executed by the owner and the tenant.

      (2) If the owner uses a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants in the locality or the premises, the lease must be in such standard form, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the owner does not use a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants, the owner may use another form of lease, such as a PHA model lease.

      (3) In all cases, the lease must include a HUD-required tenancy addendum. The tenancy addendum must include, word-for-word, all provisions required by HUD.

      (4) The PHA may review the owner's lease form to determine if the lease complies with state and local law. The PHA may decline to approve the tenancy if the PHA determines that the lease does not comply with state or local law.

      (c)  The lease must specify all of the following:

      (1) The names of the owner and the tenant;

      (2) The unit rented (address, apartment number, if any, and any other information needed to identify the leased contract unit);

      (3) The term of the lease (initial term and any provision for renewal);

      (4) The amount of the tenant rent to owner. The tenant rent to owner is subject to change during the term of the lease in accordance with HUD requirements;

      (5) A specification of what services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities are to be provided by the owner; and

      (6) The amount of any charges for food, furniture, or supportive services.

      (d)  (1) The tenancy addendum in the lease shall state:

      (i) The program tenancy requirements (as specified in this part);

      (ii) The composition of the household as approved by the PHA (names of family members and any PHA-approved live-in aide).

      (2) All provisions in the HUD-required tenancy addendum must be included in the lease. The terms of the tenancy addendum shall prevail over other provisions of the lease.

      (e)  (1) If the tenant and the owner agree to any change in the lease, such change must be in writing, and the owner must immediately give the PHA a copy of all such changes.

      (2) The owner must notify the PHA in advance of any proposed change in lease requirements governing the allocation of tenant and owner responsibilities for utilities. Such changes may be made only if approved by the PHA and in accordance with the terms of the lease relating to its amendment. The PHA must redetermine reasonable rent, in accordance with § 983.303(c), based on any change in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant, and the redetermined reasonable rent shall be used in calculation of rent to owner from the effective date of the change.

      (f)  (1) The initial lease term must be for at least one year.

      (2) The lease must provide for automatic renewal after the initial term of the lease. The lease may provide either:

      (i) For automatic renewal for successive definite terms (e.g., month-to-month or year-to-year); or

      (ii) For automatic indefinite extension of the lease term.

      (3) The term of the lease terminates if any of the following occurs:

      (i) The owner terminates the lease for good cause;

      (ii) The tenant terminates the lease;

      (iii) The owner and the tenant agree to terminate the lease;

      (iv) The PHA terminates the HAP contract; or

      (v) The PHA terminates assistance for the family.

      (g)  The lease may specify a maximum period of family absence from the unit that may be shorter than the maximum period permitted by PHA policy. (PHA termination-of-assistance actions due to family absence from the unit are subject to 24 CFR 982.312, except that the unit is not terminated from the HAP contract if the family is absent for longer than the maximum period permitted.)

      24 CFR 982.310 of this title applies with the exception that 24 CFR 982.310(d)(1)(iii) and (iv) does not apply to the PBV program. (In the PBV program, “good cause” does not include a business or economic reason or desire to use the unit for an individual, family, or non-residential rental purpose.) In addition, the owner may terminate the tenancy in accordance with the requirements related to lease terminations for development activity on units under a HAP contract as provided in § 983.157(g)(6)(iii) and for substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract as provided in § 983.212(a)(3)(iii). 24 CFR 5.858 through 5.861 on eviction for drug and alcohol abuse and 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to the PBV program.

The cessation of housing assistance payments at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such cessation preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances if such changes occur within 180 days following the date of the last housing assistance payment by the PHA. After the 180-day period, the unit shall be removed from the HAP contract pursuant to § 983.211.

      (a)  The owner may collect a security deposit from the tenant.

      (b)  The PHA must prohibit the owner from charging assisted tenants security deposits in excess of private market practice, or in excess of amounts charged by the owner to unassisted tenants.

      (c)  When the tenant moves out of the contract unit, the owner, subject to state and local law, may use the security deposit, including any interest on the deposit, in accordance with the lease, as reimbursement for any unpaid tenant rent, damages to the unit, or other amounts which the tenant owes under the lease.

      (d)  The owner must give the tenant a written list of all items charged against the security deposit and the amount of each item. After deducting the amount used to reimburse the owner, the owner must promptly refund the full amount of the balance to the tenant.

      (e)  If the security deposit is not sufficient to cover amounts the tenant owes under the lease, the owner may seek to collect the balance from the tenant. However, the PHA has no liability or responsibility for payment of any amount owed by the family to the owner.

      § 983.260   Overcrowded, under-occupied, and accessible units.

#### § § 983.260

      (a)  (1) The PHA subsidy standards determine the appropriate unit size for the family size and composition.

      (2) If the PHA determines that a family is occupying a wrong-size unit, or a unit with accessibility features that the family does not require and the unit is needed by a family that requires the accessibility features (see 24 CFR 8.27), the PHA must:

      (i) Within 30 days from the PHA's determination, notify the family and the owner of this determination; and

      (ii) Within 60 days from the PHA's determination, offer the family continued housing assistance, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b)  (1) The PHA policy on continued housing assistance must be stated in the Administrative Plan and may be in the form of:

      (i) PBV assistance in an appropriate-size unit (in the same project or in another project);

      (ii) Other project-based housing assistance ( by occupancy of a public housing unit);

      (iii) Tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program; or

      (iv) Other comparable tenant-based rental assistance.

      (2) If no continued housing assistance as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is available, the PHA must remove the wrong-size or accessible unit from the HAP contract to make voucher assistance available to issue the family a tenant-based voucher. Section 983.206(b) does not apply to families issued a tenant-based voucher under the circumstance described in this paragraph (b)(2).

      (c)  (1) If the PHA offers the family the opportunity to receive tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program:

      (i) The PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for a wrong-sized or accessible unit at the earlier of the expiration of the term of the family's voucher (including any extension granted by the PHA) or the date upon which the family vacates the unit.

      (ii) If the family does not move out of the wrong-sized unit or accessible unit by the expiration date of the term of the family's voucher, the PHA must remove the unit from the HAP contract.

      (2) If the PHA offers the family another form of continued housing assistance (other than tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program), in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for the wrong-sized or accessible unit and remove the unit from the HAP contract when:

      (i) In the case of an offer by the PHA of PBV assistance or other project-based housing assistance in an appropriate-size unit, the family does not accept the offer and does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days. The family may request and the PHA may grant one extension not to exceed up to an additional 90 days to accommodate the family's efforts to locate affordable, safe, and geographically proximate replacement housing.

      (ii) In the case of an offer by the PHA of PBV assistance or other project-based housing assistance in an appropriate size unit, the family accepts the offer but does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days.

      (iii) In the case of an offer by the PHA of other comparable tenant-based rental assistance, the family either accepts or does not accept the offer but does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days. The family may request and the PHA may grant one extension not to exceed up to an additional 90 days to accommodate the family's efforts to locate, affordable, safe, and geographically proximate replacement housing.

      (d)  The PHA may reinstate a unit removed under paragraph (b)(2), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2) of this section to the HAP contract after the family vacates the property, in accordance with § 983.207(b).

> [89 FR 38334, May 7, 2024]

      § 983.261   Family right to move.

#### § § 983.261

      (a)  The family may terminate the assisted lease at any time after one year of PBV assistance. The family must give the owner advance written notice of intent to vacate (with a copy to the PHA) in accordance with the lease.

      (b)  If the family has elected to terminate the lease in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA must offer the family the opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. The PHA must specify in the Administrative Plan whether it will offer families assistance under the voucher program or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance. If voucher assistance is offered to the family and the search term expires, the PHA must issue the voucher to the next eligible family.

      (c)  Before providing notice to terminate the lease under  of this section, a family must contact the PHA to request a voucher or comparable tenant-based rental assistance if the family wishes to move with continued assistance. If a voucher or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance is not immediately available to the family upon the family's request to the PHA, the PHA must give the family priority to receive the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. The PHA must describe in its Administrative Plan its policies and procedures for how the family must contact the PHA and how the PHA documents families waiting for continued tenant-based rental assistance.

      (d)  If the family terminates the assisted lease before one year of PBV assistance, the family relinquishes the opportunity for continued tenant-based assistance under this section.

      (e)  When the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, the family is not required to give the owner advance written notice or contact the PHA under paragraph (a) and (c), respectively, of this section before moving from the unit. Additionally, when any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move, the family is not required to give the owner advance written notice or contact the PHA under paragraph (a) and (c), respectively, of this section before moving from the unit. A PHA may not terminate the assistance of a family due to a move occurring under the circumstances in this paragraph (e) and must offer the family the opportunity for continued tenant-based assistance if the family had received at least one year of PBV assistance prior to moving.

      (f)  In the case of a move due to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, PHAs must describe policies for facilitating emergency transfers for families with PBV assistance in their Emergency Transfer Plan, consistent with the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including when the victim has received PBV assistance for less than one year and is not eligible for continued assistance under § 983.261(b).

      (g)  If a family break-up results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance in accordance with 24 CFR 982.315(a)(2).

      § 983.262   Occupancy of units under the increased program cap and project cap excepted units.

#### § § 983.262

      (a)  Pursuant to § 983.6(a), a PHA may commit project-based assistance to no more than 20 percent of its authorized voucher units at the time of commitment. There are certain units eligible for an increased program cap as described in § 983.6(d). Pursuant to § 983.54(a), the PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance or place units under an Agreement or a HAP contract in excess of the project cap. There are certain exceptions to the project cap as described in § 983.54(c). This section provides more detail on the occupancy requirements of both the excepted units from the project cap under § 983.54(c)(2) and units under the increased program cap under § 983.6(d).

      (b)  (1) The unit must be occupied by a family who meets the applicable exception.

      (2) The family must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program through an admissions preference (see § 983.251).

      (3) Once the family vacates the unit, the unit must be made available to and occupied by a family that meets the applicable exception.

      (4) The PHA must specify in its Administrative Plan which of the options below the PHA will take if a unit is no longer qualified for its excepted status or the increased program cap:

      (i) Substitute the unit for another unit if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(a), so that the overall number of excepted units or units under the increased program cap in the project is not reduced. A PHA may, in conjunction with such substitution, add the original unit to the HAP contract if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(b), including that such addition does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.

      (ii) Remove the unit from the PBV HAP contract. In conjunction with the removal, the PHA may provide the family with tenant-based assistance, if the family is eligible for tenant-based assistance. The family and the owner may agree to use the tenant-based voucher in the unit; otherwise, the family must move from the unit with the tenant-based voucher. If the family later vacates the unit, the PHA may add the unit to the PBV HAP contract in accordance with § 983.207.

      (iii) Change the unit's status under the project cap or program cap, as applicable, provided that the change does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.

      (c) —(1)  A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(i) if the family meets the definition of homeless under Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302), included in 24 CFR 578.3, at the time the family first occupies the unit.

      (2)  A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(ii) if the family is comprised of or includes a veteran (a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom) at the time the family first occupies the unit.

      (3)  The following applies to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(1)(iii):

      (i) A disabled or elderly member of the family must be eligible for one or more of the supportive services at the time the family first occupies the unit. The member of the family may choose not to participate in the services.

      (ii) The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for supportive housing for persons with disabilities or elderly persons to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family ( death of the elderly family member or family member with a disability or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member or family member with a disability no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count under the increased program cap category for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit no longer counts under the increased program cap category and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (4)  See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2).

      (d) —(1)  A unit under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(i) must be occupied by an elderly family, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403. The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for occupancy of an excepted unit based on elderly family status to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family ( death of the elderly family member or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit is no longer considered excepted and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (2)  The same provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply to units previously excepted based on disabled family status under a HAP contract in effect prior to April 18, 2017.

      (3)  The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(iii):

      (i) A unit is excepted if any member of the family is eligible for one or more of the supportive services even if the family chooses not to participate in the services.

      (ii) If any member of the family chooses to participate and successfully completes the supportive services, the unit continues to be excepted for as long as any member of the family resides in the unit, even if the members that continue to reside in the unit are ineligible during tenancy for all available supportive services.

      (iii) The unit loses its excepted status only if the entire family becomes ineligible during the tenancy for all supportive services available to the family. This provision does not apply where any member of the family has successfully completed the supportive services under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (iv) A family cannot be terminated from the program or evicted from the unit because they become ineligible for all supportive services during the tenancy.

      (4)  See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii).

      (e)  The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii) and the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2):

      (1) A unit is excepted from the project cap or qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the unit is occupied by an eligible youth receiving FUP assistance.

      (2) The youth must vacate the unit once the FUP assistance has expired. The unit loses its excepted status or no longer qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the youth does not move from the unit upon the expiration of the FUP assistance.

    Subpart G—Rent to Owner

      § 983.301   Determining the rent to owner.

#### § § 983.301

      (a)  (1) The amount of the initial and redetermined rent to owner is determined in accordance with this section and § 983.302.

      (2) The amount of the initial rent to owner is established at the beginning of the HAP contract term. For rehabilitated or newly constructed housing, the Agreement states the estimated amount of the initial rent to owner, but the actual amount of the initial rent to owner is established at the beginning of the HAP contract term.

      (3) The rent to owner is also redetermined in accordance with § 983.302.

      (b)  Except for certain tax credit units as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:

      (1) An amount determined by the PHA in accordance with the Administrative Plan not to exceed 110 percent of the applicable fair market rent (or the amount of any applicable exception payment standard) for the unit bedroom size minus any utility allowance;

      (2) The reasonable rent; or

      (3) The rent requested by the owner.

      (c)  (1) This paragraph (c) applies if:

      (i) A contract unit receives a low-income housing tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (see 26 U.S.C. 42);

      (ii) The contract unit is not located in a qualified census tract;

      (iii) In the same building, there are comparable tax credit units of the same unit bedroom size as the contract unit and the comparable tax credit units do not have any form of rental assistance other than the tax credit; and

      (iv) The tax credit rent exceeds the applicable fair market rental (or any exception payment standard) as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (2) In the case of a contract unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:

      (i) An amount determined by the PHA in accordance with the Administrative Plan, not to exceed the tax credit rent minus any utility allowance;

      (ii) The reasonable rent; or

      (iii) The rent requested by the owner.

      (3) The “tax credit rent” is the rent charged for comparable units of the same bedroom size in the building that also receive the low-income housing tax credit but do not have any additional rental assistance (, additional assistance such as tenant-based voucher assistance).

      (4) A “qualified census tract” is any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Bureau of the Census) in which:

      (i) At least 50 percent of households have an income of less than 60 percent of Area Median Gross Income (AMGI); or

      (ii) Where the poverty rate is at least 25 percent and where the census tract is designated as a qualified census tract by HUD.

      (d)  Except in the case of a tax-credit unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner for all other tax credit units may be determined by the PHA pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

      (e)  The PHA shall determine the reasonable rent in accordance with § 983.303. The rent to the owner for each contract unit may at no time exceed the reasonable rent, except in cases where, the PHA has elected within the HAP contract not to reduce rents below the initial rent to owner and, upon redetermination of the rent to owner, the reasonable rent would result in a rent below the initial rent. If the PHA has not elected within the HAP contract to establish the initial rent to owner as the rent floor, the rent to owner shall not at any time exceed the reasonable rent.

      (f)  (1) When determining the initial rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR in effect and the utility allowance schedule in effect at execution of the HAP contract. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the beginning date of the HAP contract.

      (2) When redetermining the rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR and the PHA utility allowance schedule in effect at the time of redetermination. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the redetermination date.

      (3)(i) For PBV projects that are not located in a designated SAFMR area under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1), or for PBV projects not located in a ZIP code where the PHA has opted in under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3), any exception payment standard amount approved under 24 CFR 982.503(d)(2)-(4) applies for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(iv) of this section. HUD will not approve a different payment standard amount for use in the PBV program.

      (ii) For PBV projects that are located in a designated SAFMR area under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1), or for PBV projects located in a ZIP code where the PHA has opted in under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3), an exception payment standard amount approved under 24 CFR 982.503(d)(3)-(4) will apply for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if the PHA has adopted a policy applying SAFMRs to its PBV program and met all other requirements in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(h).

      (4) HUD may establish a process allowing PHAs to adopt project-specific utility allowances by notification in the  subject to public comment. Absent the establishment of such a project-specific utility allowance, the PHA's utility allowance schedule as determined under 24 CFR 982.517(b)(2)(i) or (ii) applies to both the tenant-based and PBV programs.

      (5) The PHA must continue to use the applicable utility allowance schedule for the purpose of determining the initial rent to owner and redetermining the rent to owner for contract units, as outlined in this 24 CFR 983.301, regardless of whether the PHA approves a higher utility allowance as a reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities living in a contract unit (see 24 CFR 982.517(e)).

      (g)  For PHA-owned PBV units, the initial rent to owner and the annual redetermination of rent at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract must be determined by the independent entity approved by HUD in accordance with § 983.57. The PHA must use the rent to owner established by the independent entity.

      § 983.302   Redetermination of rent to owner.

#### § § 983.302

      (a)  The PHA must redetermine the rent to owner:

      (1) When there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR;

      (2) Upon the owner's request consistent with requirements established in the PHA's Administrative Plan. The Administrative Plan must specify any advance notice the owner must give the PHA and the form the request must take; or

      (3) At the time of the automatic adjustment by an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).

      (b)  (1) An owner may receive an increase in the rent to owner during the term of a HAP contract. Any such increase will go into effect at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract. (Provisions for special adjustments of contract rent pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(2)(B) do not apply to the voucher program.)

      (2) A rent increase may occur through automatic adjustment by an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) or as the result of an owner request for such an increase. A rent increase as the result of an owner request must be determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable. A rent increase through an adjustment by an OCAF is likewise subject to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, except there is no rent request by the owner to take into account since the PHA redetermines the rent automatically under that option.

      (3) By agreement of the parties, the HAP contract may provide for rent adjustments using an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) established by the Secretary pursuant to Section 524(c) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 at each annual anniversary of the HAP contract. OCAFs are established by the Secretary and published annually in the  The provisions in the following paragraphs apply to a contract that provides for rent adjustments using an OCAF:

      (i) The contract may require an additional increase up to an amount determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, if requested by the owner in writing, periodically during the term of the contract.

      (ii) The contract shall require an additional increase up to an amount determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, at the point of contract extension, if requested by the owner in writing.

      (4) If the HAP contract does not provide for automatic adjustment by an OCAF, then an owner who wishes to receive an increase in the rent to owner must request such an increase at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract by written notice to the PHA.

      (5) The PHA must establish the length of the required notice period for any rent increase that requires a written request from the owner. The written request must be submitted as required by the PHA ( to a particular mailing address or email address).

      (6) The PHA may not approve and the owner may not receive any increase of rent to owner until and unless the owner has complied with all requirements of the HAP contract, including compliance with the HQS (except that HQS compliance is not required for purposes of this provision for units undergoing development activity that complies with § 983.157 or substantial improvement that complies with § 983.212). The owner may not receive any retroactive increase of rent for any period of noncompliance.

      (c)  (1) If the HAP contract provides for rent adjustments by an OCAF and there is a decrease in the fair market rent, tax credit rent, or reasonable rent that requires a decrease to the rent to owner (see paragraph (b)(2)), the rent to owner must be decreased. If the HAP contract does not provide for adjustment by an OCAF and there is a decrease in the rent to owner, as established in accordance with § 983.301, the rent to owner must be decreased, regardless of whether the owner requests a rent adjustment.

      (2) At any time during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA may elect within the HAP contract to not reduce rents below the initial rent to owner. Where a PHA makes such an election, the rent to owner shall not be reduced below the initial rent to owner, except:

      (i) To correct errors in calculations in accordance with HUD requirements;

      (ii) If additional housing assistance has been combined with PBV assistance after the execution of the initial HAP contract and a rent decrease is required pursuant to § 983.153(b); or

      (iii) If a decrease in rent to owner is required based on changes in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant.

      (d)  Whenever there is a change in rent to owner, the PHA must provide written notice to the owner specifying the amount of the new rent to owner (as determined in accordance with §§ 983.301 and 983.302). The PHA notice of the rent change in rent to owner constitutes an amendment of the rent to owner specified in the HAP contract.

      (e)  (1) The contract year is the period of 12 calendar months preceding each annual anniversary of the HAP contract during the HAP contract term. The initial contract year is calculated from the first day of the first calendar month of the HAP contract term.

      (2) The annual anniversary of the HAP contract is the first day of the first calendar month after the end of the preceding contract year. The adjusted rent to owner amount applies for the period of 12 calendar months from the annual anniversary of the HAP contract.

      (3) The annual anniversary of the HAP contract for contract units completed in stages must follow § 983.207(g).

      § 983.303   Reasonable rent.

#### § § 983.303

      (a)  At all times during the term of the HAP contract, the rent to the owner for a contract unit may not exceed the reasonable rent as determined by the PHA, except that where the PHA has elected in the HAP contract to not reduce rents below the initial rent under the initial HAP contract, the rent to owner shall not be reduced below the initial rent in accordance with § 983.302(c)(2).

      (b)  The PHA must redetermine the reasonable rent:

      (1) Whenever there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the contract anniversary (for the unit sizes specified in the HAP contract) as compared with the FMR in effect 1 year before the contract anniversary.

      (2) Whenever the PHA approves a change in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant;

      (3) Whenever the HAP contract is amended to add a contract unit or substitute a different contract unit in the same building or project;

      (4) Whenever the PHA accepts a completed unit after development activity that is conducted after HAP contract execution (see § 983.156(b)(3)); and

      (5) Whenever there is any other change that may substantially affect the reasonable rent.

      (c)  (1) The reasonable rent of a contract unit must be determined by comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units.

      (2) In determining the reasonable rent, the PHA must consider factors that affect market rent, such as:

      (i) The location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the contract unit; and

      (ii) Amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the owner.

      (3) The reasonable rent determination must be based on the condition of the assisted unit at the time of the determination and not on anticipated future unit conditions.

      (d)  (1) For each unit, the PHA comparability analysis must use at least three comparable units in the private unassisted market, which may include comparable unassisted units in the premises or project.

      (2) The PHA must retain a comparability analysis that shows how the reasonable rent was determined, including major differences between the contract units and comparable unassisted units.

      (3) The comparability analysis may be performed by PHA staff or by another qualified person or entity. A person or entity that conducts the comparability analysis and any PHA staff or contractor engaged in determining the housing assistance payment based on the comparability analysis may not have any direct or indirect interest in the property.

      (e)  By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.

      (f)  (1) For PHA-owned units, the amount of the reasonable rent must be determined by an independent entity in accordance with § 983.57, rather than by the PHA. The reasonable rent must be determined in accordance with this section.

      (2) The independent entity must furnish a copy of the independent entity determination of reasonable rent for PHA-owned units to the PHA.

      (d)  Rent to owner may not exceed any limitation required to comply with HUD subsidy layering requirements. See § 983.55.

      (e)  To comply with HUD subsidy layering requirements, at the direction of HUD or its designee, a PHA shall reduce the rent to owner because of other governmental subsidies, including tax credits or tax exemptions, grants, or other subsidized financing.

      (f)  For provisions that prohibit PBV assistance to units in certain types of subsidized housing, see § 983.54.

      § 983.351   PHA payment to owner for occupied unit.

#### § § 983.351

      (a)  (1) During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA shall make housing assistance payments to the owner in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract. The payments shall be made for the months during which a contract unit is leased to and actually occupied by an eligible family.

      (2) Except for discretionary vacancy payments in accordance with § 983.352, the PHA may not make any housing assistance payment to the owner for any month after the month when the family moves out of the unit (even if household goods or property are left in the unit).

      (b)  Each month, the PHA shall make a housing assistance payment to the owner for each contract unit that complies with the HQS and is leased to and occupied by an eligible family in accordance with the HAP contract.

      (e)  To receive housing assistance payments in accordance with the HAP contract, the owner must comply with all the provisions of the HAP contract. Unless the owner complies with all the provisions of the HAP contract, the owner does not have a right to receive housing assistance payments.

      § 983.352   Vacancy payment.

#### § § 983.352

      (a)  If an assisted family moves out of the unit, the owner may keep the housing assistance payment payable for the calendar month when the family moves out (“move-out month”). However, the owner may not keep the payment if the PHA determines that the vacancy is the owner's fault.

      (b)  (1) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may provide for vacancy payments to the owner (in the amounts determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for a PHA-determined period of vacancy extending from the beginning of the first calendar month after the move-out month for a period not exceeding two full months following the move-out month.  The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the PHA's policy on the conditions under which it will allow vacancy payments in a HAP contract, the duration of the payments, amount of vacancy payments it will make to an owner, and the required form and manner of requests for vacancy payments, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (2) The vacancy payment to the owner for each month of the maximum two-month period will be determined by the PHA, and cannot exceed the monthly rent to owner under the assisted lease, minus any portion of the rental payment received by the owner (including amounts available from the tenant's security deposit). Any vacancy payment may cover only the period the unit remains vacant.

      (3) The PHA may make vacancy payments to the owner only if:

      (i) The owner gives the PHA prompt, written notice certifying that the family has vacated the unit and containing the date when the family moved out (to the best of the owner's knowledge and belief);

      (iii) The owner certifies that it has taken every reasonable action to minimize the likelihood and length of vacancy; and

      (iv) The owner provides any additional information required and requested by the PHA to verify that the owner is entitled to the vacancy payment.

      (4) The owner must submit a request for vacancy payments in the form and manner required by the PHA and must provide any information or substantiation required by the PHA to determine the amount of any vacancy payment.

      (2) Any changes in the amount of the tenant rent will be effective on the date stated in a notice by the PHA to the family and the owner.

      (b)  (1) The family is responsible for paying the tenant rent (total tenant payment minus the utility allowance).

      (2) The amount of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA is the maximum amount the owner may charge the family for rent of a contract unit. The tenant rent is payment for all housing services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities to be provided by the owner without additional charge to the tenant, in accordance with the HAP contract and lease.

      (3) The owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA. The owner must immediately return any excess payment to the tenant.

      (4) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the tenancy of an assisted family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.

      (c)  (1) The PHA is responsible only for making housing assistance payments to the owner on behalf of a family in accordance with the HAP contract. The PHA is not responsible for paying the tenant rent, or for paying any other claim by the owner.

      (2) The PHA may not use housing assistance payments or other program funds (including any administrative fee reserve) to pay any part of the tenant rent or to pay any other claim by the owner. The PHA may not make any payment to the owner for any damage to the unit, or for any other amount owed by a family under the family's lease or otherwise.

      (d)  (1) If the amount of the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, the PHA shall pay the amount of such excess as a reimbursement for tenant-paid utilities (“utility reimbursement”) and the tenant rent to the owner shall be zero.

#### § § 984.101

      (a)  (1) The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD or Department) assistance with public and private resources, to enable families eligible to receive HUD assistance to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.

      (2) The purpose of this part is to implement the policies and procedures applicable to operation of an FSS program, as established under section 23 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437u).

      (b)  This part applies to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administering a public housing program under section 9, a project-based and/or tenant-based assistance program under section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) homeownership program under section 8(y) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, or Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for low-income families and Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy for homeless individuals under 24 CFR part 882. See part 887 of this title for program regulations applicable to owners of multifamily assisted housing.

      (c)  Each PHA that administers an FSS program must do so in accordance with the requirements of this part. See § 984.105 for more information concerning PHAs that are required to administer an FSS program.

      (d)  Participation in an FSS program is voluntary. A family's admission to the public housing or Section 8 programs cannot be conditioned on participation in FSS. A family's housing assistance cannot be terminated by reason of such election or due to an FSS family's failure to comply with FSS program requirements in this part.

      § 984.102   Program objectives.

#### § § 984.102

      The objective of the FSS program is to reduce the dependency of low-income families on welfare assistance and housing subsidies. Under the FSS program, HUD assisted families are provided opportunities for education, job training, counseling, and other forms of social service assistance, while living in assisted housing, so that they may obtain the education, employment, and business and social skills necessary to achieve self-sufficiency, as defined in § 984.103. The Department will evaluate the performance of a PHA's or owner's FSS program using a scoring system that measures criteria, such as graduation from the program, increased earned income, and program participation, as provided by HUD through a  notice.

      (a)  A PHA or owner serving 25 or more participants in the FSS program is eligible to receive an award equal to the costs, as determined by the Secretary, of 1 full-time family self-sufficiency coordinator position. The Secretary may, by notice (including a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)), determine the policy concerning the award for an eligible entity serving fewer than 25 such participants, including providing prorated awards or allowing such entities to combine their programs under this section for purposes of employing a coordinator.

      (b)  A PHA or owner that meets performance standards set by the Secretary is eligible to receive an additional award sufficient to cover the costs of filling an additional FSS coordinator position if such entity has 75 or more participating families, and an additional coordinator for each additional 50 participating families, or such other ratio as may be established by the Secretary based on the award allocation evaluation under section 23(i)(2)(E) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.

      (c)  For purposes of calculating the award under this section, HUD may treat each administratively distinct part of a State or regional entity as a separate entity.

      (d)  In determining whether a PHA or owner meets a specific threshold for funding pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall consider the number of participants enrolled by the PHA or owner in its FSS program as well as other criteria determined by the Secretary.

      (e)  FSS awards shall be allocated, as established by the Secretary, in the following order of priority:

      (1)  Renewal of the full cost of all FSS coordinators in the previous year at each PHA or owner with an existing FSS program that meets applicable performance standards set by the Secretary. If this first priority cannot be fully satisfied, the Secretary may prorate the funding for each PHA or owner, as long as:

      (i) Each PHA or owner that has received funding for at least 1 part-time coordinator in the prior fiscal year is provided sufficient funding for at least 1 part-time coordinator as part of any such proration; and

      (ii) Each PHA or owner that has received funding for at least 1 full-time coordinator in the prior fiscal year is provided sufficient funding for at least 1 full-time coordinator as part of any such proration.

      (f)  Any FSS awards allocated under this section by the Secretary in a fiscal year that have not been spent by the end of the subsequent fiscal year or such other time period as determined by the Secretary may be recaptured by the Secretary and shall be available for providing additional awards pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or may be offset as determined by the Secretary.

      (g)  The Secretary may reserve up to 5 percent of the appropriated FSS funds to provide support to or reward FSS programs based on the rate of successful completion, increased earned income, or other factors as may be established by the Secretary.

      § 984.303   Contract of Participation (CoP).

#### § § 984.303

      (a)  Each eligible family that is selected to participate in an FSS program must enter into a CoP with the PHA or owner that operates the FSS program in which the family will participate. There will be no more than one CoP at any time for each family. There may be an ITSP for as many members of the family as wish to participate. The CoP shall be signed by a representative of the PHA or the owner and the head of FSS family, as designated by the family. This head of FSS family does not have to be the same as the official head of household for rental assistance purposes.

      (b) —(1)  The CoP, which incorporates the ITSP(s), shall set forth the principal terms and conditions governing participation in the FSS program. These include the rights and responsibilities of the FSS family and of the PHA or owner, the services to be provided to, and the activities to be completed by, each adult member of the FSS family who elects to participate in the program.

      (2)  The ITSP, incorporated in the CoP, shall establish specific interim and final goals by which the PHA or owner, and the family, measures the FSS family's progress towards fulfilling its obligations under the CoP and becoming self-sufficient. For any FSS family that is a recipient of welfare assistance at the outset of the CoP or that receives welfare assistance while in the FSS program, the PHA or owner must establish as a final goal for each FSS participant that every member of the family become independent from welfare assistance before the expiration of the term of the CoP, including any extension thereof. Also, see the employment obligation described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Aside from the goals specifically required in this section, PHAs or owners must work with each participant to establish realistic and individualized goals and may not include additional mandatory goals or mandatory modifications of the two mandatory goals.

      (3)  The CoP shall provide that one of the obligations of the FSS family is to comply with the terms and conditions of the respective public housing or Section 8 lease. However, all considerations allowed for other assisted residents for repayment agreements, etc., shall also be allowed for FSS participants.

      (4) —(i)  Although all members of the FSS family may seek and maintain suitable employment during the term of the contract, only the head of FSS family shall be required under the CoP to seek and maintain suitable employment during the term of the contract and any extension thereof.

      (ii)  The obligation to seek employment means searching for jobs, applying for employment, attending job interviews, and otherwise following through on employment opportunities.

      (iii)  A determination of suitable employment shall be made by the PHA or owner, with the agreement of the affected participant, based on the skills, education, job training, and receipt of other benefits of the household member, and based on the available job opportunities within the jurisdiction served by the PHA or in the community where the PBRA property is located.

      (5)  The CoP shall specify the consequences of noncompliance with the CoP as described in paragraph (i) of this section.

      (c)  The CoP shall state that each FSS family will be required to fulfill CoP obligations no later than 5 years after the first re-examination of income after the execution date of the CoP.

      (d)  The PHA or owner shall, in writing, extend the term of the CoP for a period not to exceed two (2) years for any FSS family that requests, in writing, an extension of the contract, provided that the PHA or owner finds that _good cause_ exists for granting the extension. The family's written request for an extension must include a description of the need for the extension. Extension of the CoP will entitle the FSS family to continue to have amounts credited to the family's FSS escrow account in accordance with § 984.304. As used in this paragraph (d),  means:

      (1) Circumstances beyond the control of the FSS family that impede the family's ability to complete the CoP obligations, as determined by the PHA or owner, such as a serious illness or involuntary loss of employment;

      (2) Active pursuit of a current or additional goal that will result in furtherance of self-sufficiency during the period of the extension ( completion of a college degree during which the participant is unemployed or under-employed, credit repair towards being homeownership ready, etc.) as determined by the PHA or owner; or

      (3) Any other circumstance that the PHA or owner determines warrants an extension, as long as the PHA or owner is consistent in its determination as to which circumstances warrant an extension.

      (e) —(1)  If a social service agency fails to deliver the supportive services identified in an FSS family member's ITSP, the PHA or owner shall make a good faith effort to obtain these services from another agency.

      (2)  If the PHA or owner is unable to obtain the services from another agency, the PHA or owner shall reassess the family member's needs and determine whether other available services would achieve the same purpose. If other available services would not achieve the same purpose, the PHA or owner and the family shall determine whether the unavailable services are integral to the FSS family's advancement or progress toward self-sufficiency. If the unavailable services are:

      (i) Determined not to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency, the PHA or owner shall revise the ITSP to delete these services, and modify the CoP to remove any obligation on the part of the FSS family to accept the unavailable services, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; or,

      (ii) Determined to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency, the PHA or owner shall terminate the CoP and follow the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section regarding FSS escrow disbursement.

      (f)  The PHA or owner and the FSS family may mutually agree to modify the CoP with respect to the ITSP and/or the contract term in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and/or designation of the head of FSS family. Modifications must be in writing.

      (g)  The CoP is considered to be completed, and a family's participation in the FSS program is considered to be concluded when the FSS family has fulfilled all of its obligations under the CoP, including all family members' ITSPs, on or before the expiration of the contract term, including any extension thereof.

      (h)  The CoP shall be terminated if the family's housing assistance is terminated in accordance with HUD requirements. The CoP may be terminated before the expiration of the contract term, and any extension thereof, by:

      (1) Mutual consent of the parties;

      (2) The failure of the FSS family to meet its obligations under the CoP without good cause. This includes an FSS family who has moved out of multifamily assisted housing and families receiving tenant-based assistance under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act who fail to comply with the contract requirements because the family has moved outside the jurisdiction of the PHA, and the PHA has not determined that there is good cause terminate the CoP with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section;

      (3) The family's withdrawal from the FSS program;

      (4) Such other act as is deemed inconsistent with the purpose of the FSS program; or

      (5) Operation of law.

      (i)  The PHA or owner may withhold the coordination of supportive services or terminate the FSS family's participation in the FSS program, if the PHA or owner determines, in accordance with the FSS Action Plan hearing procedures, that the FSS family has failed to comply without good cause with the requirements of the CoP in accordance with this section.

      (j)  A PHA or owner may continue to offer to a former FSS family that has completed its CoP, appropriate coordination of those FSS supportive services needed to become self-sufficient if the family still resides in public housing or Section 8 housing. If the family no longer resides in public housing, Section 8, or other assisted housing, then a PHA or owner may continue to coordinate supportive services for a former FSS family that completed its CoP using only funding sources that are not HUD funds or HUD-restricted funds.

      (k)  (1) The CoP is will be terminated with FSS disbursement when:

      (i) Services that the PHA or owner and the FSS family have agreed are integral to the FSS family's advancement towards self-sufficiency are unavailable, as described in paragraph (e) of this section;

      (ii) The head of the FSS family becomes permanently disabled and unable to work during the period of the contract, unless the PHA or owner and the FSS family determine that it is possible to modify the contract to designate a new head of the FSS family; or

      (iii) An FSS family in good standing moves outside the jurisdiction of the PHA (in accordance with portability requirements at § 982.353 of this chapter) for good cause, as determined by the PHA, and continuation of the CoP after the move, or completion of the CoP prior to the move, is not possible. PHAs must be consistent in their determinations of whether a family has good cause for a termination with FSS escrow disbursement under this paragraph (k).

      (2) Upon termination of a CoP pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section, escrow funds must be handled consistent with § 984.305.

      § 984.304   Amount of rent paid by FSS family and increases in family income.

#### § § 984.304

      (a)  The amount of rent paid by an FSS family is determined in accordance with the requirements of the applicable housing assistance program as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

      (1)  Total tenant payment for an FSS family participating in the FSS program is determined in accordance with the regulations set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart F.

      (2)  (i) For the HCV program, rent is determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 982, subpart K; and

      (ii) For the PBV program, rent is determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 983, subpart G.

      (b)  Any increase in the earned income of an FSS family during its participation in an FSS program may not be considered as income or an asset for purposes of eligibility of the FSS family under any other program administered by HUD.

      § 984.305   FSS escrow account.

#### § § 984.305

      (a) —(1)  The PHA or owner shall deposit the FSS escrow account funds of all families participating in an FSS program into a single interest-bearing depository account. The PHA or owner must deposit the FSS escrow account funds in one or more of the HUD-approved investments. The depository account may be part of the PHA's or owner's overall accounts or a separate account, as long as it is in compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. During the term of the CoP, the FSS escrow account credit amount shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section at each re-examination of income occurring after the effective date of the CoP. Such escrow credit amount must be deposited each month by the PHA or owner to each family's FSS escrow account within the PHA's or owner's depository account.

      (2) —(i)  The total of the combined FSS escrow account funds will be supported in the accounting records by a subsidiary ledger showing the balance applicable to each FSS family.

      (ii)  The investment income for funds in the FSS escrow account must be prorated and credited to each family's FSS escrow account based on the balance in each family's FSS escrow account at the end of the period for which the investment income is credited.

      (iii)  If the FSS family has not paid the family contribution towards rent, or other amounts, if any, due under the public housing or Section 8-assisted lease, the balance in the family's FSS account shall be reduced by that amount (as determined by the owner or reported by the owner to the PHA in the Section 8(o) programs) at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the FSS family has been found to have under-reported income after the baseline annual earned income was set, the amount credited to the FSS escrow account will be based on the income amounts originally reported by the FSS family. If the FSS family is found to have under-reported income in the re-examination used to set the baseline, the escrow for the entire period of the CoP will be re-calculated using the correct income to set the baseline and then calculate subsequent escrow amounts.

      (3)  Each PHA or owner will be required to make a report, at least once annually, to each FSS family on the status of the family's FSS escrow account. At a minimum, the report will include:

      (i) The balance at the beginning of the reporting period;

      (ii) The amount of the family's rent payment that was credited to the FSS escrow account, during the reporting period;

      (iii) Any deductions made from the account at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds (see paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section) for amounts due the PHA or owner;

      (iv) The amount of interest earned on the account during the year; and

      (v) The total in the account at the end of the reporting period.

      (b) —(1)  When determining the family's baseline annual earned income and the baseline monthly rent amounts for purposes of computing the FSS escrow credit, the PHA or owner must use the amounts on the family's last income re-examination.

      (2)  The FSS credit amount shall be the lower of:

      (i) Thirty (30) percent of one-twelfth ( ) ( two and a half (2.5) percent) of the amount by which the family's current annual earned income exceeds the family's baseline annual earned income; or

      (ii) The increase in the family's monthly rent. The increase in the family's monthly rent shall be the lower of:

      (A) The amount by which the family's current monthly rent exceeds the family's baseline monthly rent;

      (B) For HCV families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent ( rent to owner plus any utility allowance) or the payment standard, whichever is lower; or

      (C) For PBV, Mod Rehab, including Mod Rehab SRO, and PBRA families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent ( rent to owner or contract rent, as applicable, plus any utility allowance).

      (3)  FSS families who are not low-income families ( whose adjusted annual income exceeds eighty (80) percent of the area median income) shall not be entitled to any FSS credit.

      (4)  The PHA or owner shall not make additional credits to the FSS family's FSS escrow account:

      (i) When the FSS family has completed the CoP, as described in § 984.303(g);

      (ii) When the CoP is terminated; or

      (iii) During the time an HCV family is in the process of moving to a new unit, in accordance with HCV program requirements in part 982 of this title, and is not under a lease.

      (c) —(1)  The amount in an FSS escrow account in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family when the CoP has been completed as provided in § 984.303(g), and if, at the time of contract completion, the head of FSS family submits to the PHA or owner a certification, as defined in § 984.103, that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance.

      (2)  (i) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled its obligations under the CoP before the expiration of the contract term, and the head of FSS family submits a certification that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance, the amount in the family's FSS escrow account, in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family.

      (ii) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled certain interim goals established in the CoP and needs a portion of the FSS escrow account funds for purposes consistent with or in support of the CoP, such as completion of higher education ( college, graduate school), job training, or to meet start-up expenses involved in creation of a small business, the PHA or owner may, at the PHA's or owner's sole discretion, disburse a portion of the funds from the family's FSS escrow account to assist the family in paying those expenses. Unless the interim disbursement was made based on fraudulent information from the family, the family is not required to repay such interim disbursements if the family does not complete the CoP.

      (3)  The PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, under circumstances in which HUD has determined good cause is warranted. HUD determines that there is good cause when a CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k). Therefore, if the CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k), the PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as of the effective date of the termination of the contract.

      (4)  Before disbursement of the FSS escrow account funds to the family, the PHA or owner may verify that the FSS family is no longer a recipient of welfare assistance by requesting copies of any documents which may indicate whether the family is receiving any welfare assistance and by contacting welfare agencies.

      (d)  If the head of FSS family ceases to reside with other family members in the public housing or the Section 8-assisted unit, the remaining members of the FSS family, after consultation with the PHA or owner, shall have the right to take over the CoP or designate another family member to receive the funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (e)  An FSS family may use disbursed FSS escrow account funds, in accordance with § 984.305(c), after final disbursement for the purchase of a home, including the purchase of a home under one of HUD's homeownership programs, or other Federal, State, or local homeownership programs, unless such use is prohibited by the statute or regulations governing the particular homeownership program.

      (f) —(1)  Amounts in the FSS escrow account shall be forfeited upon the occurrence of the following:

      (i) The CoP is terminated, as provided in § 984.303(h); or,

      (ii) The CoP is completed by the family, as provided in § 984.303(g), but the FSS family is receiving welfare assistance at the time the CoP term expires, including any extension thereof.

      (2)  FSS escrow account funds forfeited by the FSS family must be used by the PHA or owner for the benefit of the FSS participants.

      (i) Specifically, such funds may be used for the following eligible activities:

      (A) Support for FSS participants in good standing, including, but not limited to, transportation, child care, training, testing fees, employment preparation costs, and other costs related to achieving obligations outlined in the CoP;

      (B) Training for FSS Program Coordinator(s); or

      (C) Other eligible activities as determined by the Secretary.

      (ii) Such funds may not be used for salary and fringe benefits of FSS Program Coordinators; general administrative costs of the FSS program, for housing assistance payments (HAP) expenses or public housing operating funds; or any other activity determined ineligible by the Secretary.

      § 984.306   HCV portability requirements for FSS participants.

#### § § 984.306

      (a) —(1)  During the first 12 months after the effective date of the FSS CoP, an FSS family may not move outside the jurisdiction of the PHA that first enrolled the family in the FSS program. However, the PHA may approve an FSS family's request to move outside of its jurisdiction under portability (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter) during this period. This paragraph (a)(1) applies to a former PBV family who received tenant-based rental assistance in accordance with § 983.261 of this chapter and exercised their right to move.

      (2)  After the first 12 months of the FSS CoP, the FSS family with a tenant-based voucher may move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability regulations (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter). This paragraph (a)(2) applies to former PBV families who received tenant-based rental assistance in accordance with § 983.261 of this chapter and exercised their right to move.

      (b)  (1) Whether the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA or absorbs the FSS family into its HCV program, the receiving PHA must enroll an FSS family in good standing in its FSS program; unless

      (i) The receiving PHA is already serving the number of FSS families identified in its FSS Action Plan and determines that it does not have the resources to manage the FSS contract; or

      (ii) The receiving PHA and the initial PHA agree to the FSS family's continued participation in the initial PHA's FSS program. Prior to the PHAs agreeing to the continued participation, the initial PHA must determine that the relocating FSS family has demonstrated that, notwithstanding the move, it will be able to fulfill its responsibilities under the initial or a modified CoP at its new place of residence. For example, the FSS family may be able to commute to the supportive services specified in the CoP, or the family may move to obtain employment as specified in the contract.

      (2) Where continued FSS participation is not possible in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the initial PHA must clearly discuss the options that may be available to the family, depending on the family's specific circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to, modification of the FSS contract, termination of the FSS contract and forfeiture of escrow, termination with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii), or locating a receiving PHA that has the capacity to enroll the family into its FSS program.

      (c)  If the receiving PHA does not administer an FSS program, the FSS family may not continue participation in the FSS program. The initial PHA must clearly discuss the options that may be available to the family, depending on the family's specific circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to, modification of the FSS contract, termination with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii), termination of the FSS contract and forfeiture of escrow, or locating a receiving PHA that administers an FSS program.

      (d)  Regardless of whether the FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA or is enrolled in the FSS program of the receiving PHA, the family will have only one FSS escrow account. If the receiving PHA is billing the initial PHA, the account will be maintained by the initial PHA. If an FSS family will be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA will transfer the family's FSS escrow account funds to the receiving PHA and the receiving PHA will maintain the funds in its FSS account.

      (e)  (1) If an FSS family relocates to another jurisdiction, as provided under this section, and is unable to fulfill its obligations under the CoP (or any modifications thereto), the PHA, which is a party to the CoP, must terminate the FSS family from the FSS program, and the family's FSS escrow account will be forfeited. Termination of FSS program participation and forfeiture of FSS escrow must be used only as a last resort, after the PHA determines, in consultation with the family, that the family would be unable to fulfill its obligations under the CoP after the move, that the current CoP cannot be modified to allow for graduation prior to porting, and that the current CoP cannot be terminated with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii). When termination is the only option, the PHA must clearly notify the family that the move will result in the loss of escrow funds.

      (2) In the event of forfeiture of the family's FSS escrow account funds, the FSS escrow account funds will revert to the PHA maintaining the FSS escrow account for the family.

      (f)  (1) If the FSS family enrolls in the receiving PHA's FSS program pursuant to this section, the receiving PHA will enter into a new CoP with the FSS family for the term remaining on the contract with the initial PHA. The initial PHA will terminate its CoP with the family.

      (2) If the FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA, pursuant to this section, the CoP executed by the initial PHA will remain as the contract in place.

      (g) —(1) If the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA, the receiving PHA may, consistent with the receiving PHA's FSS enrollment policies, enroll a family that was not an FSS participant at the initial PHA into its FSS program, provided that the initial PHA manages an FSS program and agrees to such enrollment. If the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA, but the initial PHA does not manage an FSS program, the family may not enroll in the receiving PHA's FSS program.

      (2)  If the receiving PHA absorbs the family into its HCV program, the receiving PHA may, consistent with the receiving PHA's FSS enrollment policies, enroll a family that was not an FSS participant at the initial PHA into its FSS program.

    Subpart D—Reporting

      § 984.401   Reporting.

#### § § 984.401

      Each PHA or owner that carries out an FSS program shall submit to HUD, in the form prescribed by HUD, a report regarding its FSS program. The report shall include the following information:

      (a) A description of the activities carried out under the program;

      (b) A description of the effectiveness of the program in assisting families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency, including the number of families enrolled and graduated and the number of established escrow accounts and positive escrow balances;

      (c) A description of the effectiveness of the program in coordinating resources of communities to assist families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency; and

      (d) Any recommendations by the PHA or owner or the appropriate local Program Coordinating Committee for legislative or administrative action that would improve the FSS program and ensure the effectiveness of the program.

**Source:** Source: 63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 985.1   Purpose and applicability.

#### § § 985.1

      (a)  The Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) is designed to assess whether the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs operate to help eligible families afford decent rental units at the correct subsidy cost. SEMAP also establishes a system for HUD to measure PHA performance in key Section 8 program areas and to assign performance ratings. SEMAP provides procedures for HUD to identify PHA management capabilities and deficiencies in order to target monitoring and program assistance more effectively. PHAs can use the SEMAP performance analysis to assess and improve their own program operations.

      (b)  This rule applies to PHA administration of the tenant-based Section 8 rental program (part 982 of this chapter), the project-based voucher program (part 983 of this chapter) to the extent that PBV family and unit data are reported and measured under the stated HUD verification method, and enrollment levels and contributions to escrow accounts for Section 8 participants under the family self-sufficiency program (FSS) (part 984 of this chapter).

      (c)  Subpart D of this part covers the HCV and PBV assessment for a small rural PHA as defined in § 902.101 of this chapter. Section 985.3 and subparts B and C of this part do not apply to small rural PHAs.

> [63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 40497, July 26, 1999; 88 FR 30505, May 11, 2023]

      § 985.2   Definitions.

#### § § 985.2

      (a) The terms  and  as used in this part, are defined in 24 CFR 5.100.

      (b) The definitions in 24 CFR 982.4 apply to this part. As used in this part:

      means an on site review performed by HUD to verify the management performance of an PHA.

      means a HUD-required written plan that addresses PHA program management deficiencies or findings identified by HUD through remote monitoring or on-site review, and that will bring the PHA to an acceptable level of performance.

      means Multifamily Tenant Characteristics System. _MTCS_ is the Department's national database on participants and rental units in the Section 8 rental certificate, rental voucher, and moderate rehabilitation programs and in the Public and Indian Housing programs.

      means a Housing Agency.

      means an annual sample of files or records drawn in an unbiased manner and reviewed by an PHA supervisor (or by another qualified person other than the person who performed the original work) to determine if the work documented in the files or records conforms to program requirements. The minimum size of the _PHA's quality control sample_ is as follows:

      means a standard set for a key area of Section 8 program management against which the PHA's performance is measured to show whether the PHA administers the program properly and effectively. (See § 985.3.)

      means the PHA's annual certification to HUD, on the form prescribed by HUD, concerning its performance in key Section 8 program areas.

      means any rating of 0 points on a SEMAP performance indicator.

      means a summary prepared by HUD of an PHA's ratings on each SEMAP indicator, its overall SEMAP score, and its overall performance rating (high performer, standard, troubled).

> [63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 40497, July 26, 1999]

      § 985.3   Indicators, HUD verification methods and ratings.

#### § § 985.3

      This section states the performance indicators that are used to assess PHA Section 8 management. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator in reviewing the accuracy of an PHA's annual SEMAP certification. HUD will prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA and will assign a rating for each indicator as shown. If the HUD verification method for the indicator relies on data in MTCS and HUD determines those data are insufficient to verify the PHA's certification on the indicator due to the PHA's failure to adequately report family data, HUD will assign a zero rating for the indicator. The method for selecting the PHA's quality control sample under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that the PHA's quality control sample was drawn in an unbiased manner.

      A PHA that expends less than its Federal award expenditure threshold in 2 CFR Subpart F, and whose Section 8 programs are not audited by an independent auditor (IA), will not be rated under the SEMAP indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which the annual IA audit report is a HUD verification method.

      (a)  (1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has written policies in its administrative plan for selecting applicants from the waiting list and whether the PHA follows these policies when selecting applicants for admission from the waiting list. (24 CFR 982.54(d)(1) and 982.204(a))

      (2) HUD verification method: The independent auditor (IA) annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.

      (3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:

      (A) The PHA has written waiting list selection policies in its administrative plan and,

      (B) Based on the PHA's quality control samples, drawn separately for applicants reaching the top of the waiting list and for admissions, documentation shows that at least 98 percent of the families in both samples of applicants and admissions were selected from the waiting list for admission in accordance with these policies and met the selection criteria that determined their places on the waiting list and their order of selection. 15 points.

      (ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.

      (b)  (1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has and implements a reasonable written method to determine and document for each unit leased that the rent to owner is reasonable based on current rents for comparable unassisted units: At the time of initial leasing; if there is any increase in the rent to owner; at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published fair market rent (FMR) in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. The PHA's method must take into consideration the location, size, type, quality and age of the units, and the amenities, housing services, and maintenance and utilities provided by the owners in determining comparability and the reasonable rent. (24 CFR 982.4, 24 CFR 982.54(d)(15), 982.158(f)(7), 982.507, and 983.303)

      (2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.

      (3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:

      (h)  (1) Submission of deconcentration data in the HUD-prescribed format for this indicator is mandatory for a PHA using one or more payment standard amount(s) that exceed(s) 100 percent of the published FMR set at the 50th percentile rent to provide access to a broad range of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area in accordance with § 888.113(c) of this title, starting with the second full PHA fiscal year following initial use of payment standard amounts based on the FMR set at the 50th percentile rent. Submission of deconcentration data for this indicator is optional for all other PHAs. Additional SEMAP points are available to PHAs that have jurisdiction in metropolitan FMR areas and that choose to submit with their SEMAP certifications certain data, in a HUD-prescribed format, on the percent of their tenant-based Section 8 families with children who live in, and who have moved during the PHA fiscal year to, low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area. For purposes of this indicator, the PHA's principal operating area is the geographic entity for which the Census tabulates data that most closely matches the PHA's geographic jurisdiction under State or local law (e.g., city, county, metropolitan statistical area) as determined by the PHA, subject to HUD review. A low poverty census tract is defined as a census tract where the poverty rate of the tract is at or below 10 percent, or at or below the overall poverty rate for the principal operating area of the PHA, whichever is greater. The PHA determines the overall poverty rate for its principal operating area using the most recent available decennial Census data. Family data used for the PHA's analysis must be the same information as reported to MTCS for the PHA's tenant-based Section 8 families with children. If HUD determines that the quantity of MTCS data is insufficient for adequate analysis, HUD will not award points under this bonus indicator. Bonus points will be awarded if:

      (i) Half or more of all Section 8 families with children assisted by the PHA in its principal operating area at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year reside in low poverty census tracts;

      (ii) The percent of Section 8 mover families with children who moved to low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area during the last completed PHA fiscal year is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who reside in low poverty census tracts at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year; or

      (iii) The percent of Section 8 families with children who moved to low-poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area over the last two completed PHA fiscal years is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who resided in low poverty census tracts at the end of the second to last completed PHA fiscal year.

      (iv) State and regional PHAs that provide Section 8 rental assistance in more than one metropolitan area within a State or region make these determinations separately for each metropolitan area or portion of a metropolitan area where the PHA has assisted at least 20 Section 8 families with children in the last completed PHA fiscal year.

      (2) HUD verification methods: PHA data submitted for the deconcentration bonus, the IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification, and on-site confirmatory review if performed.

      (3) Rating: (i) The data submitted by the PHA for the deconcentration bonus shows that the PHA met the requirements for bonus points in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section. 5 points.

      (2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows percent of newly leased units where the beginning date of the assistance contract is before the date the unit passed the initial unit inspection or, if the PHA employed the PHA initial inspection option for non-life- threatening deficiencies or alternative inspections, the timing requirements for the applicable PHA initial inspection option.

      (3) Rating:

      (i) 98 to 100 percent of newly leased units passed HQS inspection within the time period required. 5 points.

      (ii) Fewer than 98 percent of newly leased units passed HQS inspection within the time period required. 0 points.

      (m)  (1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has met its periodic inspection requirement for its units under contract (24 CFR 982.405 and 983.103(e)).

      (2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows percent of HQS inspections that are more than 2 months overdue. The 2-month allowance is provided only to accommodate a possible lag in the PHA's electronic reporting of the annual HQS inspection on Form HUD-50058, and to allow the processing of the data into MTCS. The 2-month allowance provided here for rating purposes does not mean that any delay in completing annual HQS inspections is permitted.

      (3) Rating:

      (i) Fewer than 5 percent of periodic HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 10 points.

      (ii) 5 to 10 percent of all periodic HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 5 points.

      (iii) More than 10 percent of all periodic HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 0 points.

      (n)  The provisions of this paragraph (n) apply to the first SEMAP certification due after July 2, 2012.

      (1)  This indicator shows whether the PHA enters into HAP contracts for the number of the PHA's baseline voucher units (units that are contracted under a Consolidated ACC) for the calendar year that ends on or before the PHA's fiscal year or whether the PHA has expended its allocated budget authority for the same calendar year. Allocated budget authority will be based upon the PHA's eligibility, which includes budget authority obligated for the calendar year and any portion of HAP reserves attributable to the budget authority that was offset from reserves during the calendar year. Litigation units and funding will be excluded from this indicator, and new increments will be excluded for 12 months from the effective date of the increment on the Consolidated ACC. Units assisted under the voucher homeownership option and units occupied under a project-based HAP contract are included in the measurement of this indicator.

      (2)  This method is based on the percent of units leased under a tenant-based or project-based HAP contract or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year. The percent of units leased is determined by taking unit months leased under a HAP contract and unit months occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, as shown in HUD systems for the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year, and dividing that number by the number of unit months available for leasing based on the number of baseline units available at the beginning of the calendar year.

      (3)  (i) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was 98 percent or more. (20 points.)

      (ii) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was 95 to 97 percent. (15 points.)

      (iii) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was less than 95 percent. (0 points.)

      (o)  (1) This indicator applies only to PHAs with mandatory FSS programs. The indicator consists of 2 components which show whether the PHA has enrolled families in the FSS program as required, and the extent of the PHA's progress in supporting FSS by measuring the percent of current FSS participants with FSS progress reports entered in MTCS that have had increases in earned income which resulted in escrow account balances. (24 CFR 984.105 and 984.305)

      (2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows number of families currently enrolled in FSS. This number is divided by the number of mandatory FSS slots, as determined under § 984.105 of this chapter. An MTCS report also shows the percent of FSS families with FSS progress reports who have escrow account balances. HUD also uses information reported on the SEMAP certification by initial PHAs concerning FSS families enrolled in their FSS programs but who have moved under portability to the jurisdiction of another PHA.

      (3) Rating:

      (i) The PHA has filled 80 percent or more of its mandatory FSS slots and 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances. 10 points.

      (ii) The PHA has filled 60 to 79 percent of its mandatory FSS slots and 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances. 8 points.

      (iv) 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances, but fewer than 60 percent of the PHA's mandatory FSS slots are filled. 5 points.

      (v) The PHA has filled 60 to 79 percent of its mandatory FSS slots, but fewer than 30 percent of FSS families have escrow account balances. 3 points.

      (vi) The PHA has filled fewer than 60 percent of its mandatory FSS slots and less than 30 percent of FSS families have escrow account balances. 0 points.

      (p)  (1) This indicator shows whether voucher holders were successful in leasing units with voucher assistance. This indicator applies only to PHAs that established success rate payment standard amounts in accordance with § 982.503(f) prior to June 6, 2024.

      (2) HUD verification method: MTCS Report.

      (3)  (i) The proportion of families issued rental vouchers during the last PHA fiscal year that have become participants in the voucher program is more than the higher of:

      (A) 75 percent; or

      (B) The proportion of families issued rental vouchers that became participants in the program during the six month period utilized to determine eligibility for success rate payment standards under § 982.503(f) plus 5 percentage points; and

      § 985.102   SEMAP profile.

#### § § 985.102

      Upon receipt of the PHA's SEMAP certification, HUD will rate the PHA's performance under each SEMAP indicator in accordance with § 985.3. HUD will then prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA which shows the rating for each indicator, sums the indicator ratings, and divides by the total possible points to arrive at an PHA's overall SEMAP score. SEMAP scores shall be rounded off to the nearest whole percent.

      § 985.103   SEMAP score and overall performance rating.

#### § § 985.103

      (a)  PHAs with SEMAP scores of at least 90 percent shall be rated high performers under SEMAP. PHAs that achieve an overall performance rating of high performer may receive national recognition by the Department and may be given competitive advantage under notices of fund availability.

      (b)  PHAs with SEMAP scores of 60 to 89 percent shall be rated standard.

      (c)  PHAs with SEMAP scores of less than 60 percent shall be rated troubled.

      (d)  A rating on any of the indicators at §§ 985.3(a) through 985.3(h) will be subject to change after HUD receives the PHA's annual audit report or after HUD conducts a confirmatory review if the audit report or the confirmatory review report contains information that the PHA's SEMAP certification concerning an indicator is not accurate.

      (e)  (1) Notwithstanding an PHA's SEMAP score, HUD may modify or withhold an PHA's overall performance rating when warranted by circumstances which have bearing on the SEMAP indicators such as an PHA's appeal of its overall rating, adverse litigation, a conciliation agreement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring and compliance review findings, fraud or misconduct, audit findings or substantial noncompliance with program requirements.

      (2) Notwithstanding an PHA's SEMAP score, if the latest IA report submitted for the PHA under the Single Audit Act indicates that the auditor is unable to provide an opinion as to whether the PHA's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals, or an opinion that the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, the PHA will automatically be given an overall performance rating of troubled and the PHA will be subject to the requirements at § 985.107.

      (3) When HUD modifies or withholds a rating for any reason, it shall explain in writing to the PHA the reasons for the modification or for withholding the rating.

      § 985.104   PHA right of appeal of overall rating.

#### § § 985.104

      An PHA may appeal its overall performance rating to HUD by providing justification of the reasons for its appeal. An appeal made to a HUD hub or program center or to the HUD Troubled Agency Recovery Center and denied may be further appealed to the Assistant Secretary.

      § 985.105   HUD SEMAP responsibilities.

#### § § 985.105

      (a) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD shall assess each PHA's performance under SEMAP annually and shall assign each PHA a SEMAP score and overall performance rating.

      (2)  HUD shall assess and score the performance of a PHA with less than 250 assisted units once every other PHA fiscal year, unless the PHA:

      (i) Elects to have its performance assessed on an annual basis; or

      (ii) Is designated as troubled, in accordance with § 985.103.

      (b)  No later than 120 calendar days after the PHA's fiscal year end, HUD shall notify each PHA in writing of its rating on each SEMAP indicator, of its overall SEMAP score and of its overall performance rating (high performer, standard, troubled). The HUD notification letter shall identify and require correction of any SEMAP deficiencies (indicator rating of zero) within 45 calendar days from date of HUD notice.

      (c)  HUD may conduct an on-site confirmatory review to verify the PHA certification and the HUD rating under any indicator.

      (d)  HUD must conduct an on-site confirmatory review of an PHA's performance before changing any annual overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer.

      (e)  HUD must review, consider and provide a final written determination to an PHA on its appeal of its overall performance rating.

      (f)  HUD must review the adequacy and monitor implementation of PHA corrective action plans submitted under § 985.106(c) or § 985.107(c) and provide technical assistance to help the PHA improve program management. If an PHA is assigned an overall performance rating of troubled, the PHA's corrective action plan must be approved in writing by HUD.

      (b) The PHA must send a written report to HUD describing its correction of any identified SEMAP deficiency.

      (c) If an PHA fails to correct a SEMAP deficiency within 45 calendar days as required, HUD may then require the PHA to prepare and submit a corrective action plan for the deficiency within 30 calendar days from the date of HUD notice.

      § 985.107   Required actions for PHA with troubled performance rating.

#### § § 985.107

      (a) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD will conduct an on-site review of PHA program management for any PHA assigned an overall performance rating of troubled to assess the magnitude and seriousness of the PHA's noncompliance with performance requirements.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, HUD may elect not to conduct an on-site review of a troubled PHA, if:

      (i) The PHA has less than 250 assisted units; and

      (ii) HUD determines that an on-site review is unnecessary to determine the needs of the PHA and the actions required to address the program deficiencies.

      (b)  HUD must provide the PHA a written report of its on-site review containing HUD findings of program management deficiencies, the apparent reasons for the deficiencies, and recommendations for improvement.

      (c)  Upon receipt of the HUD written report on its on-site review, the PHA must write a corrective action plan and submit it to HUD for approval. The corrective action plan must:

      (1) Specify goals to be achieved;

      (2) Identify obstacles to goal achievement and ways to eliminate or avoid them;

      (3) Identify resources that will be used or sought to achieve goals;

      (4) Identify an PHA staff person with lead responsibility for completing each goal;

      (5) Identify key tasks to reach each goal;

      (6) Specify time frames for achievement of each goal, including intermediate time frames to complete each key task; and

      (7) Provide for regular evaluation of progress toward improvement.

      (8) Be signed by the PHA board of commissioners chairperson and by the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or a state, the corrective action plan must be signed by the Section 8 program director and by the chief executive officer of the unit of government or his or her designee.

      (d)  The PHA and HUD must monitor the PHA's implementation of its corrective action plan to ensure performance targets are met.

      (e)  Any PHA assigned an overall performance rating of troubled may not use any part of the administrative fee reserve for other housing purposes (see 24 CFR 982.155(b)).

      (f)  HUD shall change an PHA's overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer if HUD determines that a change in the rating is warranted because of improved PHA performance and an improved SEMAP score.

    Subpart D—Small Rural PHA Assessment

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 30505, May 11, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

      § 985.201   Applicability.

#### § § 985.201

      (a) This subpart applies to small rural PHAs as defined in § 902.101 of this chapter.

      (b) Small rural PHAs shall be assessed and rated on the indicators and methodology of this subpart and shall not be subject to the SEMAP requirements.

      § 985.203   Assessment indicators and HUD verification methods.

#### § § 985.203

      (a) This section describes the performance indicators used to assess a PHA's designation as troubled resulting from the small rural PHA assessment. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator. The four indicators are determined on a pass or fail basis.

      (b)(1)  This indicator shows whether the PHA applied the correct inspection standards to HCV and PBV unit inspections.

      (2)  The PHA's assessment certification and on-site HUD review when applicable.

      (3)  The PHA passes the indicator if it applied the correct inspection standards for all unit HCV and PBV unit inspections conducted during the assessment period. If the PHA applied the incorrect inspection standards for any HCV or PBV unit inspection during the assessment period, the PHA fails the indicator.

      (c)(1)  This indicator determines if the PHA conducted the initial HQS inspections within the required time period.

      (2)  HUD systems show percent of newly leased units where the beginning date of the assistance contract is before the date the unit passed the initial unit inspection or, if the PHA employed the PHA initial inspection option for non-life-threatening deficiencies or alternative inspections, the timing requirements for the applicable PHA initial inspection option.

      (3)  The PHA passes the indicator if at least 98 percent of units placed under HAP contract during the assessment period passed the initial PHA HQS inspection within the required time period. If fewer than 98 percent of units placed under HAP contract during the assessment period passed the HQS inspection within the required time periods, the PHA fails the indicator.

      (d)(1)  This indicator shows, for units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years, whether the PHA re-inspected tenant-based units under HAP contract and the required sample of PBV units at least once during the three-year period from the last PHA inspection.

      (2)  HUD systems show the percentage of units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years that have been re-inspected within the required three-year period from the last inspection.

      (3)  The PHA passes the indicator if at least 98 percent of the units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years have been re-inspected within the required three-year period from the last inspection. The PHA fails the indicator if fewer than 98 percent of these units have been re-inspected within the required three-year period.

      (e)(1)  This indicator shows whether, following the inspection of a unit under contract where the unit fails to meet the required standards, any cited life-threatening and non-life-threatening deficiencies are corrected within the required cure period in accordance with §§ 982.404 and 983.103 of this chapter. In addition, if HQS deficiencies are not corrected timely, the indicator shows whether the PHA stops (abates) housing assistance payments beginning no later than the first of the month following the specified correction period or terminates the HAP contract or, for family-caused defects, takes prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. (§ 982.404 of this chapter)

      (2)  The PHA certification and on-site HUD review (if performed), and HUD system data.

      (3)  In order to pass the indicator, the applicable verification method, which may include sampling, determines that the PHA took corrective action within the required timeframes for at least 98 percent of inspections with identified life-threatening or other HQS deficiencies.

      (f)(1)  The PHA must submit its certifications for the applicable indicators within the designated timeframe required by HUD, and in the form and manner as required by HUD. HUD will issue instructions on the submission of PHA certifications by  notification, which will be subject to public comment.

      (2)  Failure of the PHA to submit any certification in accordance with this paragraph will result in the PHA failing the indicator and being designated as troubled under the small rural PHA assessment.

      § 985.205   Determination of assessment rating.

#### § § 985.205

      (a)  (1) A PHA is designated a high performer under the small rural PHA assessment if the PHA has passed all four indicators identified in § 985.203 and the PHA:

      (i) Has utilized at least 98 percent of its HCV budget authority in the two most recent calendar years, or the percent of HCV units leased by renters or occupied by homeowners in the two most recent calendar years was at least 98 percent;

      (ii) Did not end that calendar year with excess HAP reserves; and

      (iii) Did not end that calendar year in a funding shortfall or receive shortfall prevention funding from HUD.

      (2) HUD shall publish the calculation for determining excess HAP reserves in the  and such calculation shall provide for public comment before becoming effective.

      (b)  A PHA that passed all four indicators but did not meet the funding utilization criteria for a high performer designation in paragraph (a) is designated as a standard performer.

      (c)  A PHA that failed any of the four indicators under § 985.201 is designated as a troubled PHA under the small rural PHA assessment.

      § 985.207   Frequency of assessments.

#### § § 985.207

      (a) —(1)  The initial small rural PHA assessment will be effective when the PHA's next SEMAP assessment would have been applied. For PHAs that qualify for SEMAP biennial review as a small PHA (less than 250 assisted units), the transition to the small rural PHA assessment will occur when the PHA's next biennial SEMAP assessment is required.

      (2)  HUD shall assess small rural PHAs no more than once every three years, except that a troubled small rural PHA shall be subject to an annual assessment in accordance with § 985.209.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 985.209   Troubled small rural PHAs.

#### § § 985.209

      (a) —(1)  HUD must review, consider, and provide a final written determination to a small rural PHA that appeals its designation as a troubled PHA.

      (2)  The HUD decision on the PHA appeal shall be made by a HUD official who has not been involved in and is not subordinate to any person who has been involved in the original determination to designate the PHA as a troubled PHA under the small rural PHA assessment.

      (b)  No later than 60 days after the date on which the PHA is designated a troubled PHA, the PHA and HUD will enter into a corrective action agreement (CAA) under which the PHA shall take actions to correct the deficiencies upon which the troubled PHA designation is based. The PHA must comply with HUD requirements for the submission of the CAA, including but not limited to the date by which the CAA must be submitted to HUD. The CAA must:

      (1) Have a term of one year, and shall be renewable at the option of HUD;

      (2) Specify goals to be achieved;

      (3) Identify obstacles to goal achievement and ways to eliminate or avoid them;

      (4) Identify resources that will be used or sought to achieve goals;

      (5) Provide, where feasible, for technical assistance to assist the PHA in curing its deficiencies;

      (6) Identify a PHA staff person with lead responsibility for completing each goal;

      (7) Identify key tasks to reach each goal;

      (8) Specify time frames for achievement of each goal, including intermediate time frames to complete each key task;

      (9) Provide for regular evaluation of progress toward improvement;

      (10) Provide for the reconsideration of the PHA's designation as a troubled PHA no less than annually, and provide for the termination of the CAA when HUD determines the PHA is no longer troubled;

      (11) Provide that in the event of substantial noncompliance by the PHA under the CAA, HUD may (i) contract with another PHA or a private entity to administer the HCV program; and (ii) withhold funds otherwise distributable to the troubled PHA;

      (12) Be signed by the PHA board of commissioners chairperson and by the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or a State, the CAA must be signed by the Section 8 program director and by the chief executive officer of the unit of government or his or her designee.

      (c)  The PHA and HUD must monitor the PHA's implementation of its CAA to ensure performance targets are met.

      (d)  A troubled PHA shall be subject to the small rural assessment on an annual basis.

      (e)  Any PHA designated as troubled may not use any part of the administrative fee reserve for other housing purposes ( § 982.155(b) of this chapter).

      (f)  HUD shall change a PHA's overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer if HUD determines that a change in the rating is warranted because of improved PHA performance and a standard or high designation on a subsequent small rural PHA assessment.

      (g)  HUD may determine that a PHA's failure to correct identified deficiencies resulting from its small rural PHA assessment or to execute and implement a CAA as required by HUD constitutes a default under the ACC.

      § 985.211   Small rural PHA assessment records.

#### § § 985.211

      HUD shall maintain small rural PHA assessment files, including designations, notifications, appeals, corrective action agreements, and related correspondence for at least 3 years.

  PART 990—THE PUBLIC HOUSING OPERATING FUND PROGRAM

### Part 990

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437g; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose, Applicability, Formula, and Definitions

      § 990.100   Purpose.

#### § § 990.100

      This part implements section 9(f) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), (42 U.S.C. 1437g). Section 9(f) establishes an Operating Fund for the purposes of making assistance available to public housing agencies (PHAs) for the operation and management of public housing. In the case of unsubsidized housing, the total expenses of operating rental housing should be covered by the operating income, which primarily consists of rental income and, to some degree, investment and non-rental income. In the case of public housing, the Operating Fund provides operating subsidy to assist PHAs to serve low, very low, and extremely low-income families. This part describes the policies and procedures for Operating Fund formula calculations and management under the Operating Fund Program.

      § 990.105   Applicability.

#### § § 990.105

      (a)  (1) With the exception of subpart I of this part, this part is applicable to all PHA rental units under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). This includes PHAs that have not received operating subsidy previously, but are eligible for operating subsidy under the Operating Fund Formula.

      (2) This part is applicable to all rental units managed by a resident management corporation (RMC), including a direct-funded RMC.

      (b)  (1) This part is not applicable to Indian Housing, section 5(h) and section 32 homeownership projects, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the section 23 Leased Housing Program, or the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs.

      (2) With the exception of subpart J of this part, this part is not applicable to the Mutual Help Program or the Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Program.

      § 990.110   Operating fund formula.

#### § § 990.110

      (a)  (1) The amount of annual contributions (operating subsidy) each PHA is eligible to receive under this part shall be determined by a formula.

      (2) In general, operating subsidy shall be the difference between formula expense and formula income. If a PHA's formula expense is greater than its formula income, then the PHA is eligible for an operating subsidy.

      (3) Formula expense is an estimate of a PHA's operating expense and is determined by the following three components: Project Expense Level (PEL), Utility Expense Level (UEL), and other formula expenses (add-ons). Formula expense and its three components are further described in subpart C of this part. Formula income is an estimate for a PHA's non-operating subsidy revenue and is further described in subpart D of this part.

      (4) Certain portions of the operating fund formula (, PEL) are calculated in terms of per unit per month (PUM) amounts and are converted into whole dollars by multiplying the PUM amount by the number of eligible unit months (EUMs). EUMs are further described in subpart B of this part.

      (b)  (1) A PHA's formula amount shall be the sum of the three formula expense components calculated as follows: {[(PEL multiplied by EUM) plus (UEL multiplied by EUM) plus add-ons] minus (formula income multiplied by EUM)}.

      (2) A PHA whose formula amount is equal to or less than zero is still eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit cost for its Operating Fund Program.

      (3) Operating subsidy payments will be limited to the availability of funds as described in § 990.210(c).

      (c)  This part defines the major components of the Operating Fund Formula and describes the relationships of these various components. However, this part does not codify certain secondary elements that will be used in the revised Operating Fund Formula. HUD will more appropriately provide this information in non-codified guidance, such as a Handbook,  notice, or other non-regulatory means that HUD determines appropriate.

      § 990.115   Definitions.

#### § § 990.115

      is the amount of annual contributions for operations a PHA receives each funding period under section 9 of the 1937 Act as determined by the Operating Fund Formula in this part.

      means PHA expenses that are recognized as formula expenses but are not included either in the project expense level or in the utility expense level.

      is the amount for all utilities consumed at a project that the Formula recognizes in the computation of a PHA's utility expense level at that project.

      Per unit per month (PUM) describes a dollar amount on a monthly basis per unit, such as Project Expense Level, Utility Expense Level, and formula income.

      means each PHA project under an ACC to which the Operating Fund Formula is applicable. However, for purposes of asset management, as described in subpart H of this part, projects may be as identified under the ACC or may be a reasonable grouping of projects or portions of a project or projects under the ACC.

      is the provision of property management services that is tailored to the unique needs of each property, given the resources available to that property.

      is the amount of estimated expenses for each project (excluding utilities and add-ons) expressed as a PUM cost.

      means all dwelling units in all of a PHA's projects under an ACC.

      is the average of the yearly consumption levels for the 36-month period ending on the June 30th that is 18 months prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period.

      is the timing and amount by which a PHA will realize increases and reductions in operating subsidy based on the new funding levels of the Operating Fund Formula.

      are the total number of project units in a PHA's inventory expressed in months for a specified time frame.

      means electricity, gas, heating fuel, water, and sewerage service.

      expense level (UEL) is a product of the utility rate multiplied by the payable consumption level multiplied by the utilities inflation factor expressed as a PUM dollar amount.

      means the actual average rate for any given utility for the most recent 12-month period that ended the June 30th prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period.

      is the actual amount of each utility consumed at a project during a 12-month period ending June 30th.

      § 990.116   Environmental review requirements.

#### § § 990.116

      The environmental review procedures of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58 are applicable to the Operating Fund Program.

    Subpart B—Eligibility for Operating Subsidy; Computation of Eligible Unit Months

      § 990.120   Unit months.

#### § § 990.120

      (a) Some of the components of HUD's Operating Fund Formula are based on a measure known as unit months. Unit months represent a PHA's public housing inventory during a specified period of time. The unit months eligible for operating subsidy in a 12-month period are equal to the number of months that the units are in an operating subsidy-eligible category, adjusted for changes in inventory (, units added or removed), as described below.

      (b) A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for a unit on the date it is both placed under the ACC and occupied. The date a unit is eligible for operating subsidy does not change the Date of Full Availability (DOFA) or the date of the End of Initial Operating Period (EIOP), nor does this provision place a project into management status.

      § 990.125   Eligible units.

#### § § 990.125

      A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for public housing units under an ACC for:

      (a) Occupied dwelling units as defined in § 990.140;

      (b) A dwelling unit with an approved vacancy (as defined in § 990.145); and

      (c) A limited number of vacancies (as defined in § 990.150).

      § 990.130   Ineligible units.

#### § § 990.130

      (a) Vacant units that do not fall within the definition of § 990.145 or § 990.150 are not eligible for operating subsidy under this part.

      (b) Units that are eligible to receive an asset-repositioning fee, as described in § 990.190(h), are not eligible to receive operating subsidy under this subpart.

      § 990.135   Eligible unit months (EUMs).

#### § § 990.135

      (a) A PHA's total number of EUMs will be calculated for the 12-month period from July 1st to June 30th that is prior to the first day of the applicable funding period, and will consist of eligible units as defined in § 990.140, § 990.145, or § 990.150.

      (b)(1) The determination of whether a public housing unit satisfies the requirements of § 990.140, § 990.145, or § 990.150 for any unit month shall be based on the unit's status as of either the first or last day of the month, as determined by the PHA.

      (2) HUD reserves the right to determine the status of any and all public housing units based on information in its information systems.

      (c) The PHA shall maintain and, at HUD's request, shall make available to HUD, specific documentation of the status of all units, including, but not limited to, a listing of the units, street addresses or physical address, and project/management control numbers.

      (d) Any unit months that do not meet the requirements of this subpart are not eligible for operating subsidy, and will not be subsidized by the Operating Fund.

      § 990.140   Occupied dwelling units.

#### § § 990.140

      A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for public housing units for each unit month that those units are under an ACC and occupied by a public housing-eligible family under lease.

      § 990.145   Dwelling units with approved vacancies.

#### § § 990.145

      (a) A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for vacant public housing units for each unit month the units are under an ACC and meet one of the following HUD-approved vacancies:

      (1)  Vacancies resulting from project modernization or unit modernization (such as work necessary to reoccupy vacant units) provided that one of the following conditions is met:

      (i) The unit is undergoing modernization (, the modernization contract has been awarded or force account work has started) and must be vacant to perform the work, and the construction is on schedule according to a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan; or

      (ii) The unit must be vacant to perform the work and the treatment of the vacant unit is included in a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan, but the time period for placing the vacant unit under construction has not yet expired. The PHA shall place the vacant unit under construction within two federal fiscal years (FFYs) after the FFY in which the capital funds are approved.

      (2)  Units approved and used for resident services, resident organization offices, and related activities, such as self-sufficiency and anti-crime initiatives.

      (b) On a project-by-project basis, subject to prior HUD approval and for the time period agreed to by HUD, a PHA shall receive operating subsidy for the units affected by the following events that are outside the control of the PHA:

      (1)  Units that are vacant due to litigation, such as a court order or settlement agreement that is legally enforceable; units that are vacant in order to meet regulatory and statutory requirements to avoid potential litigation (as covered in a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan); and units under voluntary compliance agreements with HUD or other voluntary compliance agreements acceptable to HUD (, units that are being held vacant as part of a court-order, HUD-approved desegregation plan, or voluntary compliance agreement requiring modifications to the units to make them accessible pursuant to 24 CFR part 8).

      (2)  Units that are vacant due to a federally declared, state-declared, or other declared disaster.

      (3)  Damaged units that remain vacant due to delays in settling insurance claims.

      (c) A PHA may appeal to HUD to receive operating subsidy for units that are vacant due to changing market conditions (see subpart G of this part—Appeals).

      § 990.150   Limited vacancies.

#### § § 990.150

      (a)  HUD will pay operating subsidy for a limited number of vacant units under an ACC. The limited number of vacant units must be equal to or less than 3 percent of the unit months on a project-by-project basis based on the definition of a project under § 990.265 (provided that the number of eligible unit months does not exceed 100 percent of the unit months for a project).

      (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA with 100 or fewer units will be paid operating subsidy for up to five vacant units not to exceed 100 percent of the unit months under an ACC. For example, a PHA with an inventory of 100 units and four vacancies during its fiscal year will be eligible for operating subsidy for all 100 units. A PHA with an inventory of 50 units with seven vacancies during its fiscal year will be eligible for operating subsidy for 48 units.

      § 990.155   Addition and deletion of units.

#### § § 990.155

      (a)  To generate a change to its formula amount within each one-year funding period, PHAs shall periodically (, quarterly) report the following information to HUD, during the funding period:

      (1) New units that were added to the ACC, and occupied by a public housing-eligible family during the prior reporting period for the one-year funding period, but have not been included in the previous EUMs' data; and

      (2) Projects, or entire buildings in a project, that are eligible to receive an asset repositioning fee in accordance with the provisions in § 990.190(h).

      (b)  (1) For new units, the revised calculation shall assume that all such units will be fully occupied for the balance of that funding period. The actual occupancy/vacancy status of these units will be included to calculate the PHA's operating subsidy in the subsequent funding period after these units have one full year of a reporting cycle.

      (2) Projects, or entire buildings in a project, that are eligible to receive an asset repositioning fee in accordance with § 990.190(h) are not to be included in the calculation of EUMs. Funding for these units is provided under the conditions described in § 990.190(h).

    Subpart C—Calculating Formula Expenses

      § 990.160   Overview of calculating formula expenses.

#### § § 990.160

      (a)  Formula expenses represent the costs of services and materials needed by a well-run PHA to sustain the project. These costs include items such as administration, maintenance, and utilities. HUD also determines a PHA's formula expenses at a project level. HUD uses the following three factors to determine the overall formula expense level for each project:

      (1)The project expense level (PEL) (calculated in accordance with § 990.165);

      (2) The utilities expense level (UEL) (calculated in accordance with §§ 990.170, 990.175, 990.180, and 990.185); and

      (3)Other formula expenses (add-ons) (calculated in accordance with § 990.190).

      (b)  Each project of a PHA has a unique PEL and UEL. The PEL for each project is based on ten characteristics and certain adjustments described in § 990.165. The PEL represents the normal expenses of operating public housing projects, such as maintenance and administration costs. The UEL for each project represents utility expenses. Utility expense levels are based on an incentive system aimed at reducing utility expenses. Both the PEL and UEL are expressed in PUM costs. The expenses not included in these expense levels and which are unique to PHAs are titled “other formula expenses (add-ons)” and are expressed in a dollar amount.

      (c)  The formula expense of any one project is the sum of the project's PEL and the UEL, multiplied by the total EUMs specific to the project, plus the add-ons.

      § 990.165   Computation of project expense level (PEL).

#### § § 990.165

      (a)  The PEL is calculated in terms of PUM cost and represents the costs associated with the project, except for utility and add-on costs. Costs associated with the PEL are administration, management fees, maintenance, protective services, leasing, occupancy, staffing, and other expenses, such as project insurance. HUD will calculate the PEL using regression analysis and benchmarking for the actual costs of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) projects to estimate costs for public housing projects. HUD will use the ten variables described in paragraph (b) of this section and their associated coefficient (, values that are expressed in percentage terms) to produce a PEL.

      (b)  The ten variables are:

      (1) Size of project (number of units);

      (2) Age of property (Date of Full Availability (DOFA));

      (3) Bedroom mix;

      (4) Building type;

      (5) Occupancy type (family or senior);

      (6) Location (an indicator of the type of community in which a property is located; location types include rural, city central metropolitan, and non-city central metropolitan (suburban) areas);

      (7) Neighborhood poverty rate;

      (8) Percent of households assisted;

      (9) Ownership type (profit, non-profit, or limited dividend); and

      (10) Geographic.

      (c)  HUD will apply four adjustments to the PEL. The adjustments are:

      (1) Application of a $200 PUM floor for any senior property and a $215 PUM floor for any family property;

      (2) Application of a $420 PUM ceiling for any property except for New York City Housing Authority projects, which have a $480 PUM ceiling;

      (3) Application of a four percent reduction for any PEL calculated over $325 PUM, with the reduction limited so that a PEL will not be reduced to less than $325; and

      (4) The reduction of audit costs as reported for FFY 2003 in a PUM amount.

      (d)  The PEL for each project shall be adjusted annually, beginning in 2005, by the local inflation factor. The local inflation factor shall be the HUD-determined weighted average percentage increase in local government wages and salaries for the area in which the PHA is located, and non-wage expenses.

      (e)  To calculate a specific PEL for a given property, the sum of the coefficients for nine variables (all variables except ownership type) shall be added to a formula constant. The exponent of that sum shall be multiplied by a percentage to reflect the non-profit ownership type, which will produce an unadjusted PEL. For the calculation of the initial PEL, the cost adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section will be applied. After these initial adjustments are applied, the audit adjustment described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section will be applied to arrive at the PEL in year 2000 dollars. After the PEL in year 2000 dollars is created, the annual inflation factor as described in paragraph (d) of this section will be applied cumulatively to this number through 2004 to yield an initial PEL in terms of current dollars.

      (f)  PHAs participating in the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration authorized under section 204 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) shall receive an operating subsidy as provided in Attachment A of their MTW Agreements executed prior to November 18, 2005. PHAs with an MTW Agreement will continue to have the right to request extensions of or modifications to their MTW Agreements.

      (g)  If, prior to November 18, 2005, a PHA has either a mixed-finance arrangement that has closed or has filed documents in accordance with 24 CFR 941.606 for a mixed-finance transaction, then the project covered by the mixed-finance transaction will receive funding based on the higher of its former Allowable Expense Level or the new computed PEL.

      (h)  When sufficient data are unavailable for the calculation of a PEL, HUD may calculate a PEL using an alternative methodology. The characteristics may be used from similarly situated properties.

      (i)  In 2009, HUD will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders, to review the methodology to evaluate the PEL based on actual cost data. The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). HUD may determine appropriate funding levels for each project to be effective in FY 2011 after following appropriate rulemaking procedures.

      § 990.170   Computation of utilities expense level (UEL): Overview.

#### § § 990.170

      (a)  The UEL for each PHA is based on its consumption for each utility, the applicable rates for each utility, and an applicable inflation factor. The UEL for a given funding period is the product of the utility rate multiplied by the payable consumption level multiplied by the inflation factor. The UEL is expressed in terms of PUM costs.

      (b)  The utility rate for each type of utility will be the actual average rate from the most recent 12-month period that ended June 30th prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period. The rate will be calculated by dividing the actual utility cost by the actual utility consumption, with consideration for pass-through costs (, state and local utility taxes, tariffs) for the time period specified in this paragraph.

      (c)  The payable consumption level is based on the current consumption level adjusted by a utility consumption incentive. The incentive shall be computed by comparing current consumption levels of each utility to the rolling base consumption level. If the comparison reflects a decrease in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall retain 75 percent of this decrease. Alternately, if the comparison reflects an increase in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall absorb 75 percent of this increase.

      (d)  The UEL shall be adjusted annually by an inflation/deflation factor based upon the fuels and utilities component of the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The annual adjustment to the UEL shall reflect the most recently published and localized data available from BLS at the time the annual adjustment is calculated.

      (e)  Increases in tenant utility allowances, as a component of the formula income, as described in § 990.195, shall result in a commensurate increase of operating subsidy. Decreases in such utility allowances shall result in a commensurate decrease in operating subsidy.

      (f)  (1) Appropriate utility records, satisfactory to HUD, shall be developed and maintained, so that consumption and rate data can be determined.

      (2) All records shall be kept by utility and by project for each 12-month period ending June 30th.

      (3) HUD will notify each PHA when HUD has the automated systems capacity to receive such information. Each PHA then will be obligated to provide consumption and cost data to HUD for all utilities for each project.

      (4) If a PHA has not maintained or cannot recapture utility data from its records for a particular utility, the PHA shall compute the UEL by:

      (i) Using actual consumption data for the last complete year(s) of available data or data of comparable project(s) that have comparable utility delivery systems and occupancy, in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD; or

      (ii) Requesting field office approval to use actual PUM utility expenses for its UEL in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD when the PHA cannot obtain necessary data to calculate the UEL in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.

      § 990.175   Utilities expense level: Computation of the current consumption level.

#### § § 990.175

      The current consumption level shall be the actual amount of each utility consumed during the 12-month period ending June 30th that is 6 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.

      § 990.180   Utilities expense level: Computation of the rolling base consumption level.

#### § § 990.180

      (a)  (1) The rolling base consumption level (RBCL) shall be equal to the average of yearly consumption levels for the 36-month period ending on the June 30th that is 18 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.

      (2) The yearly consumption level is the actual amount of each utility consumed during a 12-month period ending June 30th. For example, for the funding period January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2006, the RBCL will be the average of the following yearly consumption levels:

      (i) Year 1 = July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002.

      (ii) Year 2 = July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003.

      (iii) Year 3 = July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004.

      (b)  The PHA shall have its RBCL determined so as not to distort the rolling base period in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD if:

      (1) A project has not been in operation during at least 12 months of the rolling base period;

      (2) A project enters or exits management after the rolling base period and prior to the end of the applicable funding period; or

      (3) A project has experienced a conversion from one energy source to another, switched from PHA-supplied to resident-purchased utilities during or after the rolling base period, or for any other reason that would cause the RBCL not to be comparable to the current year's consumption level.

      (c)  The three-year rolling base for all relevant utilities will be adjusted to reflect any financial incentives to the PHA to reduce consumption as described in § 990.185.

      § 990.185   Utilities expense level: Incentives for energy conservation/rate reduction.

#### § § 990.185

      (a)  If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD, the PHA may qualify for the incentives available under this section. For a PHA to qualify for these incentives, the PHA must enter into a contract to finance the energy conservation measures, and must obtain HUD approval. Such approval shall be based on a determination that payments under a contract can be funded from reasonably anticipated energy cost savings. The contract period shall not exceed 20 years. The energy conservation measures may include, but are not limited to: Physical improvements financed by a loan from a bank, utility, or governmental entity; management of costs under the performance contract; or a shared savings agreement with a private energy service company. All such contracts shall be known as energy performance contracts. PHAs may extend an executed energy performance contract with a term of less than 20 years to a term of not more than 20 years, to permit additional energy conservation improvements without the reprocurement of energy performance contractors. The PHA must obtain HUD approval to extend the term of an executed energy performance contract.

      (1)  (i) If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are approved by HUD, the RBCL for the project and the utilities involved may be frozen during the contract period. Before the RBCL is frozen, it must be adjusted to reflect any energy savings resulting from the use of any HUD funding. The RBCL also may be adjusted to reflect systems repaired to meet applicable building and safety codes as well as to reflect adjustments for occupancy rates increased by rehabilitation. The RBCL shall be frozen at the level calculated for the year during which the conservation measures initially shall be implemented.

      (ii) The PHA operating subsidy eligibility shall reflect the retention of 100 percent of the savings from decreased consumption until the term of the financing agreement is complete. The PHA must use at least 75 percent of the cost savings to pay off the debt, , pay off the contractor or bank loan. If less than 75 percent of the cost savings is used for debt payment, however, HUD shall retain the difference between the actual percentage of cost savings used to pay off the debt and 75 percent of the cost savings. If at least 75 percent of the cost savings is paid to the contractor or bank, the PHA may use the full amount of the remaining cost savings for any eligible operating expense.

      (iii) The annual three-year rolling base procedures for computing the RBCL shall be reactivated after the PHA satisfies the conditions of the contract. The three years of consumption data to be used in calculating the RBCL after the end of the contract period shall be the yearly consumption levels for the final three years of the contract.

      (2) PHAs undertaking energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD may include resident-paid utilities under the consumption reduction incentive, using the following methodology:

      (i) The PHA reviews and updates all utility allowances to ascertain that residents are receiving the proper allowances before energy savings measures are begun;

      (ii) The PHA makes future calculations of rental income for purposes of the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility based on these baseline allowances. In effect, HUD will freeze the baseline allowances for the duration of the contract;

      (iii) After implementation of the energy conservation measures, the PHA updates the utility allowances in accordance with provisions in 24 CFR part 965, subpart E. The new allowance should be lower than baseline allowances;

      (iv) The PHA uses at least 75 percent of the savings for paying the cost of the improvement (the PHA will be permitted to retain 100 percent of the difference between the baseline allowances and revised allowances);

      (v) After the completion of the contract period, the PHA begins using the revised allowances in calculating its operating subsidy eligibility; and

      (vi) The PHA may exclude from its calculation of rental income the increased rental income due to the difference between the baseline allowances and the revised allowances of the projects involved, for the duration of the contract period.

      (3)  (i) If a PHA qualifies for this incentive (_i.e._, the subsidy add-on, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section), then the PHA is eligible for additional operating subsidy each year of the contract to amortize the cost of the loan for the energy conservation measures and other direct costs related to the energy project under the contract during the term of the contract subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The PHA's operating subsidy for the current funding year will continue to be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 990.170 (, the rolling base is not frozen). The PHA will be able to retain part of the cost savings in accordance with § 990.170(c).

      (ii) The actual cost of energy (of the type affected by the energy conservation measure) after implementation of the energy conservation measure will be subtracted from the expected energy cost, to produce the energy cost savings for the year.

      (iii) If the cost savings for any year during the contract period are less than the amount of operating subsidy to be made available under this paragraph to pay for the energy conservation measure in that year, the deficiency will be offset against the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility for the PHA's next fiscal year.

      (iv) If energy cost savings are less than the amount necessary to meet amortization payments specified in a contract, the contract term may be extended (up to the 20-year limit) if HUD determines that the shortfall is the result of changed circumstances, rather than a miscalculation or misrepresentation of projected energy savings by the contractor or PHA. The contract term may be extended only to accommodate payment to the contractor and associated direct costs.

      (b)  If a PHA takes action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings, such as well-head purchase of natural gas, administrative appeals, or legal action to reduce the rate it pays for utilities, then the PHA will be permitted to retain one-half the annual savings realized from these actions.

      (c)  HUD will pursue benchmarking utility consumption at the project level as part of the transition to asset management. HUD intends to establish benchmarks by collecting utility consumption and cost information on a project-by-project basis. In 2009, after conducting a feasibility study, HUD will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders to review utility benchmarking options so that HUD may determine whether or how to implement utility benchmarking to be effective in FY 2011. The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). The HUD study shall take into account typical levels of utilities consumption at public housing developments based upon factors such as building and unit type and size, temperature zones, age and construction of building, and other relevant factors.

      § 990.190   Other formula expenses (add-ons).

#### § § 990.190

      In addition to calculating operating subsidy based on the PEL and UEL, a PHA's eligible formula expenses shall be increased by add-ons. The allowed add-ons are:

      (a)  A PHA may request operating subsidy for the reasonable cost of program coordinator(s) and associated costs in accordance with HUD's self-sufficiency program regulations and notices.

      (b)  A PHA may qualify for operating subsidy for payments of principal and interest cost for energy conservation measures described in § 990.185(a)(3).

      (c)  Each PHA will receive an amount for PILOT in accordance with section 6(d) of the 1937 Act, based on its cooperation agreement or its latest actual PILOT payment.

      (d)  A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs for the Operating Fund Program when an audit is required by the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) (see 2 CFR part 200, subpart F) or when a PHA elects to prepare and submit such an audit to HUD. For the purpose of this rule, the most recent actual audit costs include the associated costs of an audit for the Operating Fund Program only. A PHA whose operating subsidy is determined to be zero based on the formula is still eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs. The most recent actual audit costs are used as a proxy to cover the cost of the next audit. If a PHA does not have a recent actual audit cost, the PHA working with HUD may establish an audit cost. A PHA that requests funding for an audit shall complete an audit. The results of the audit shall be transmitted in a time and manner prescribed by HUD.

      (e)  Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $25 per occupied unit per year for resident participation activities, including, but not limited to, those described in 24 CFR part 964. For purposes of this section, a unit is eligible to receive resident participation funding if it is occupied by a public housing resident or it is occupied by a PHA employee, or a police officer or other security personnel who is not otherwise eligible for public housing. In any fiscal year, if appropriations are not sufficient to meet all funding requirements under this part, then the resident participation component of the formula will be adjusted accordingly.

      (f)  Each PHA with at least 250 units shall receive a $4 PUM asset management fee. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to transition to asset management shall receive an asset management fee of $2 PUM. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to have their entire portfolio treated and considered as a single project as described in § 990.260(b) or PHAs with only one project will not be eligible for an asset management fee. For all PHAs eligible to receive the asset management fee, the fee will be based on the total number of ACC units. PHAs that are not in compliance with asset management as described in subpart H of this part by FY 2011 will forfeit this fee.

      (g)  Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $2 PUM for costs attributable to information technology. For all PHAs, this fee will be based on the total number of ACC units.

      (h)  (1) A PHA that transitions projects or entire buildings of a project out of its inventory is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee. This fee supplements the costs associated with administration and management of demolition or disposition, tenant relocation, and minimum protection and service associated with such efforts. The asset-repositioning fee is not intended for individual units within a multi-unit building undergoing similar activities.

      (2) Projects covered by applications approved for demolition or disposition shall be eligible for an asset repositioning fee on the first day of the next quarter six months after the date the first unit becomes vacant after the relocation date included in the approved relocation plan. When this condition is met, the project and all associated units are no longer considered an EUM as described in § 990.155. Each PHA is responsible for accurately applying and maintaining supporting documentation on the start date of this transition period or is subject to forfeiture of this add-on.

      (3) Units categorized for demolition and which are eligible for an asset repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months, 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months, and 25 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.

      (4) Units categorized for disposition and which are eligible for an asset repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months and 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.

      (5) The following is an example of how eligibility for an asset-repositioning fee is determined:

      (i) A PHA has HUD's approval to demolish (or dispose of) a 100-unit project from its 1,000 unit inventory. On January 12th, in conjunction with the PHA's approved Relocation Plan, a unit in that project becomes vacant. Accordingly, the demolition/disposition-approved project is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee on October 1st. (This date is calculated as follows: January 12th + six months = July 12th. The first day of the next quarter is October 1st.)

      (ii) Although payment of the asset-repositioning fee will not begin until October 1st, the PHA will receive its full operating subsidy based on the 1,000 units through September 30th. On October 1st the PHA will begin to receive the 36-month asset-repositioning fee in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the 100 units approved for demolition. (Asset repositioning fee requirements for projects approved for disposition are found in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.) On October 1st, the PHA's units will be 900.

      (i)  In the event that HUD determines that enactment of a Federal law or revision in HUD or other Federal regulations has caused or will cause a significant change in expenditures of a continuing nature above the PEL and UEL, HUD may, at HUD's sole discretion, decide to prescribe a procedure under which the PHA may apply for or may receive an adjustment in operating subsidy.

    Subpart D—Calculating Formula Income

      § 990.195   Calculation of formula income.

#### § § 990.195

      (a)  For the purpose of the formula, formula income is equal to the amount of rent charged to tenants divided by the respective unit months leased, and is therefore expressed as a PUM. Formula income will be derived from a PHA's year-end financial information. The financial information used in the formula income computation will be the audited information provided by the PHA through HUD's information systems. The information will be calculated using the following PHA fiscal year-end information:

      (1) April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004;

      (2) July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004;

      (3) October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2004; and

      (4) January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2004.

      (b)  To calculate formula income in whole dollars, the PUM amount will be multiplied by the EUMs as described in subpart B of this part.

      (c)  After a PHA's formula income is calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section, it will not be recalculated or inflated for fiscal years 2007 through 2009, unless a PHA can show a severe local economic hardship that is impacting the PHA's ability to maintain some semblance of its formula income (see subpart G of this part—Appeals). A PHA's formula income may be recalculated if the PHA appeals to HUD for an adjustment in its formula.

      (d)  When audited data are unavailable in HUD's information systems for the calculation of formula income, HUD may use an alternative methodology, including, but not limited to, certifications, hard copy reports, and communications with the respective PHAs.

      (e)  Formula income is not subject to the provisions regarding program income in 24 CFR 85.25 (as revised April 1, 2013).

> [70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005; 70 FR 61367, Oct. 24, 2005; 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]

    Subpart E—Determination and Payment of Operating Subsidy

      § 990.200   Determination of formula amount.

#### § § 990.200

      (a)  The amount of operating subsidy that a PHA is eligible for is the difference between its formula expenses (as calculated under subpart C of this part) and its formula income (as calculated under subpart D of this part).

      (b)  HUD shall utilize its databases to make the formula calculations. HUD's databases are intended to be employed to provide information on all primary factors in determining the operating subsidy amount. Each PHA is responsible for supplying accurate information on the status of each of its units in HUD's databases.

      (c)  PHAs shall submit data used in the formula on a regular and timely basis to ensure accurate calculation under the formula. If a PHA fails to provide accurate data, HUD will make a determination as to the PHA's inventory, occupancy, and financial information using available or verified data, which may result in a lower operating subsidy. HUD has the right to adjust any or all formula amounts based on clerical, mathematical, and information system errors that affect any of the data elements used in the calculation of the formula.

      § 990.205   Fungibility of operating subsidy between projects.

#### § § 990.205

      (a)  Operating subsidy shall remain fully fungible between ACC projects until operating subsidy is calculated by HUD at a project level. After subsidy is calculated at a project level, operating subsidy can be transferred as the PHA determines during the PHA's fiscal year to another ACC project(s) if a project's financial information, as described more fully in § 990.280, produces excess cash flow, and only in the amount up to those excess cash flows.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and subject to all of the other provisions of this part, the New York City Housing Authority's Development Grant Project Amendment Number 180, dated July 13, 1995, to Consolidated Annual Contributions Contract NY-333, remains in effect.

      § 990.210   Payment of operating subsidy.

#### § § 990.210

      (a)  HUD shall make monthly payments equal to   of a PHA's total annual operating subsidy under the formula by electronic funds transfers through HUD's automated disbursement system. HUD shall establish thresholds that permit PHAs to request monthly installments. Requests by PHAs that exceed these thresholds will be subject to HUD review. HUD approvals of requests that exceed these thresholds are limited to PHAs that have an unanticipated and immediate need for disbursement.

      (b)  In the event that the amount of operating subsidy has not been determined by HUD as of the beginning of the funding period, operating subsidy shall be provided monthly, quarterly, or annually based on the amount of the PHA's previous year's formula or another amount that HUD may determine to be appropriate.

      (c)  In the event that insufficient funds are available, HUD shall have discretion to revise, on a pro rata basis, the amounts of operating subsidy to be paid to PHAs.

      § 990.215   Payments of operating subsidy conditioned upon reexamination of income of families in occupancy.

#### § § 990.215

      (a)  Each PHA is required to reexamine the income of each family in accordance with the provisions of the ACC, the 1937 Act, and HUD regulations. Income reexaminations shall be performed annually, except as provided in the 1937 Act, in HUD regulations, or in the MTW agreements. A PHA must be in compliance with all reexamination requirements in order to be eligible to receive full operating subsidy. A PHA's calculations of rent and utility allowances shall be accurate and timely.

      (b)  A PHA shall submit a certification that states that the PHA is in compliance with the annual income reexamination requirements and its rent and utility allowance calculations have been or will be adjusted in accordance with current HUD requirements and regulations.

      (c)  Any PHA not in compliance with annual income reexamination requirements at the time of the submission of the calculation of operating subsidy shall furnish to the responsible HUD field office a copy of the procedures it is using to achieve compliance and a statement of the number of families that have undergone reexamination during the 12 months preceding the current funding cycle. If, on the basis of this submission or any other information, HUD determines that the PHA is not substantially in compliance with all of the annual income reexamination requirements, HUD shall withhold payments to which the PHA may be entitled under this part. Payment may be withheld in an amount equal to HUD's estimate of the loss of rental income to the PHA resulting from its failure to comply with the requirements.

    Subpart F—Transition Policy and Transition Funding

      § 990.220   Purpose.

#### § § 990.220

      This policy is aimed at assisting all PHAs in transitioning to the new funding levels as determined by the formula set forth in this rule. PHAs will be subject to a transition funding policy that will either increase or reduce their total operating subsidy for a given year.

      § 990.225   Transition determination.

#### § § 990.225

      The determination of the amount and period of the transition funding shall be based on the difference in subsidy levels between the formula set forth in this part and the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula set forth in this part. The difference in subsidy levels will be calculated using FY 2004 data. When actual data are not available for one of the formula components needed to calculate the formula of this part for FY 2004, HUD will use alternate data as a substitute (, unit months available for eligible unit months, etc.) If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA shall have its operating subsidy reduced as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to a transition policy as indicated in § 990.230. If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA will have its operating subsidy increased as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to the transition policy as indicated in § 990.235.

      § 990.230   PHAs that will experience a subsidy reduction.

#### § § 990.230

      (a) For PHAs that will experience a reduction in their operating subsidy, as determined in § 990.225, such reductions will have a limit of:

      (1) 5 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the first year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;

      (2) 24 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the second year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;

      (3) 43 percent of the difference between the two levels in the third year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;

      (4) 62 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fourth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part; and

      (5) 81 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fifth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.

      (b) The full amount of the reduction in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the sixth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.

      (c) For example, a PHA has a subsidy reduction from $1 million, under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part, to $900,000, under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million − $900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy reduction would be limited to $5,000 (5 percent of the difference). Thus, the PHA would receive an operating subsidy amount pursuant to this rule plus a transition-funding amount of $95,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $5,000 reduction limit).

      (d) If a PHA can demonstrate a successful conversion to the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part, as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will discontinue the reduction at the PHA's next subsidy calculation following such demonstration, as reflected in the schedule in paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding § 990.290(c).

      (e) The schedule for successful demonstration of conversion to asset management for discontinuation of PHA subsidy reduction is reflected in the table below:

      (f)(1) For purposes of this section, compliance with the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part will be based on an independent assessment conducted by a HUD-approved professional familiar with property management practices in the region or state in which the PHA is located.

      (2) A PHA must select from a list of HUD-approved professionals to conduct the independent assessment. The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination of compliance with the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part.

      (3) Upon completion of the independent assessment, the assessor shall conduct an exit conference with the PHA. In response to the exit conference, the PHA may submit a management response and other pertinent information (including, but not limited to, an additional assessment procured at the PHAs' own expense) within ten working days of the exit conference to be included in the report submitted to HUD.

      (4) In the event that HUD is unable to produce a list of independent assessors on a timely basis, the PHA may submit its own demonstration of a successful conversion to asset management directly to HUD for determination of compliance.

      (5) The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) shall consider all information submitted and respond with a final determination of compliance within 60 days of the independent assessor's report being submitted to HUD.

      § 990.235   PHAs that will experience a subsidy increase.

#### § § 990.235

      (a) For PHAs that will experience a gain in their operating subsidy, as determined in § 990.225, such increases will have a limit of 50 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the first year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.

      (b) The full amount of the increase in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the second year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.

      (c) For example, a PHA's subsidy increased from $900,000 under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part to $1 million under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million−$900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy increase would be limited to $50,000 (50 percent of the difference). Thus, in this example the PHA will receive the operating subsidy amount of this rule minus a transition-funding amount of $50,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $50,000 transition amount).

      (d) The schedule for a PHA whose subsidy would be increased is reflected in the table below.

    Subpart G—Appeals

      § 990.240   General.

#### § § 990.240

      (a) PHAs will be provided opportunities for appeals. HUD will provide up to a two percent hold-back of the Operating Fund appropriation for FY 2006 and FY 2007. HUD will use the hold-back amount to fund appeals that are filed during each of these fiscal years. Hold-back funds not utilized will be added back to the formula within each of the affected fiscal years.

      (b) Appeals are voluntary and must cover an entire portfolio, not single projects. However, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) has the discretion to accept appeals of less than an entire portfolio for PHAs with greater than 5,000 public housing units.

      § 990.245   Types of appeals.

#### § § 990.245

      (a)  This appeal would demonstrate that the application of a specific Operating Fund formula component has a blatant and objective flaw.

      (b)  After a PHA's formula income has been frozen, the PHA can appeal to have its formula income adjusted to reflect a severe local economic hardship that is impacting the PHA's ability to maintain rental and other revenue.

      (c)  This appeal would be based on demonstrations that the model's predictions are not reliable because of specific local conditions. To be eligible, the affected PHA must demonstrate a variance of ten percent or greater in its PEL.

      (d)  A PHA may appeal to receive operating subsidy for vacant units due to changing market conditions, after a PHA has taken aggressive marketing and outreach measures to rent these units. For example, a PHA could appeal if it is located in an area experiencing population loss or economic dislocations that faces a lack of demand for housing in the foreseeable future.

      (e)  A PHA may appeal its PEL if it can produce actual project cost data derived from actual asset management, as outlined in subpart H of this part, for a period of at least two years.

      § 990.250   Requirements for certain appeals.

#### § § 990.250

      (a) Appeals under § 990.245 (a) and (c) must be submitted once annually. Appeals under § 990.245 (a) and (c) must be submitted for new projects entering a PHA's inventory within one year of the applicable Date of Full Availability (DOFA).

      (b) Appeals under § 990.245 (c) and (e) are subject to the following requirements:

      (1) The PHA is required to acquire an independent cost assessment of its projects;

      (2) The cost of services for the independent cost assessment is to be paid by the appellant PHA;

      (3) The assessment is to be reviewed by a professional familiar with property management practices and costs in the region or state in which the appealing PHA is located. This professional is to be procured by HUD. The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination; and

      (4) If the appeal is granted, the PHA agrees to be bound to the independent cost assessment regardless of new funding levels.

    Subpart H—Asset Management

      § 990.255   Overview.

#### § § 990.255

      (a) PHAs shall manage their properties according to an asset management model, consistent with the management norms in the broader multi-family management industry. PHAs shall also implement project-based management, project-based budgeting, and project-based accounting, which are essential components of asset management. The goals of asset management are to:

      (1) Improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of managing public housing assets;

      (2) Better preserve and protect each asset;

      (3) Provide appropriate mechanisms for monitoring performance at the property level; and

      (4) Facilitate future investment and reinvestment in public housing by public and private sector entities.

      (b) HUD recognizes that appropriate changes in its regulatory and monitoring programs may be needed to support PHAs to undertake the goals identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 990.260   Applicability.

#### § § 990.260

      (a) PHAs that own and operate 250 or more dwelling rental units under title I of the 1937 Act, including units managed by a third-party entity (for example, a resident management corporation) but excluding section 8 units, are required to operate using an asset management model consistent with this subpart.

      (b) PHAs that own and operate fewer than 250 dwelling rental units may treat their entire portfolio as a single project. However, if a PHA selects this option, it will not receive the add-on for the asset management fee described in § 990.190(f).

      § 990.265   Identification of projects.

#### § § 990.265

      For purposes of this subpart, project means a public housing building or set of buildings grouped for the purpose of management. A project may be as identified under the ACC or may be a reasonable grouping of projects or portions of a project under the ACC. HUD shall retain the right to disapprove of a PHA's designation of a project. PHAs may group up to 250 scattered-site dwelling rental units into a single project.

      § 990.270   Asset management.

#### § § 990.270

      As owners, PHAs have asset management responsibilities that are above and beyond property management activities. These responsibilities include decision-making on topics such as long-term capital planning and allocation, the setting of ceiling or flat rents, review of financial information and physical stock, property management performance, long-term viability of properties, property repositioning and replacement strategies, risk management responsibilities pertaining to regulatory compliance, and those decisions otherwise consistent with the PHA's ACC responsibilities, as appropriate.

      § 990.275   Project-based management (PBM).

#### § § 990.275

      PBM is the provision of property-based management services that is tailored to the unique needs of each property, given the resources available to that property. These property management services include, but are not limited to, marketing, leasing, resident services, routine and preventive maintenance, lease enforcement, protective services, and other tasks associated with the day-to-day operation of rental housing at the project level. Under PBM, these property management services are arranged, coordinated, or overseen by management personnel who have been assigned responsibility for the day-to-day operation of that property and who are charged with direct oversight of operations of that property. Property management services may be arranged or provided centrally; however, in those cases in which property management services are arranged or provided centrally, the arrangement or provision of these services must be done in the best interests of the property, considering such factors as cost and responsiveness.

      § 990.280   Project-based budgeting and accounting.

#### § § 990.280

      (a) All PHAs covered by this subpart shall develop and maintain a system of budgeting and accounting for each project in a manner that allows for analysis of the actual revenues and expenses associated with each property. Project-based budgeting and accounting will be applied to all programs and revenue sources that support projects under an ACC (, the Operating Fund, the Capital Fund, etc.).

      (b)(1) Financial information to be budgeted and accounted for at a project level shall include all data needed to complete project-based financial statements in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), including revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity data. The PHA shall also maintain all records to support those financial transactions. At the time of conversion to project-based accounting, a PHA shall apportion its assets, liabilities, and equity to its respective projects and HUD-accepted central office cost centers.

      (2) Provided that the PHA complies with GAAP and other associated laws and regulations pertaining to financial management ( 2 CFR part 200it shall have the maximum amount of responsibility and flexibility in implementing project-based accounting.

      (3) Project-specific operating income shall include, but is not limited to, such items as project-specific operating subsidy, dwelling and non-dwelling rental income, excess utilities income, and other PHA or HUD-identified income that is project-specific for management purposes.

      (4) Project-specific operating expenses shall include, but are not limited to, direct administrative costs, utilities costs, maintenance costs, tenant services, protective services, general expenses, non-routine or capital expenses, and other PHA or HUD-identified costs which are project-specific for management purposes. Project-specific operating costs also shall include a property management fee charged to each project that is used to fund operations of the central office. Amounts that can be charged to each project for the property management fee must be reasonable. If the PHA contracts with a private management company to manage a project, the PHA may use the difference between the property management fee paid to the private management company and the fee that is reasonable to fund operations of the central office and other eligible purposes.

      (5) If the project has excess cash flow available after meeting all reasonable operating needs of the property, the PHA may use this excess cash flow for the following purposes:

      (i) Fungibility between projects as provided for in § 990.205.

      (ii) Charging each project a reasonable asset management fee that may also be used to fund operations of the central office. However, this asset management fee may be charged only if the PHA performs all asset management activities described in this subpart (including project-based management, budgeting, and accounting). Asset management fees are considered a direct expense.

      (iii) Other eligible purposes.

      (c) In addition to project-specific records, PHAs may establish central office cost centers to account for non-project specific costs (, human resources, Executive Director's office, etc.). These costs shall be funded from the property-management fees received from each property, and from the asset management fees to the extent these are available.

      (d) In the case where a PHA chooses to centralize functions that directly support a project (, central maintenance), it must charge each project using a fee-for-service approach. Each project shall be charged for the actual services received and only to the extent that such amounts are reasonable.

      § 990.285   Records and reports.

#### § § 990.285

      (a) Each PHA shall maintain project-based budgets and fiscal year-end financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and shall make these budgets and financial statements available for review upon request by interested members of the public.

      (b) Each PHA shall distribute the project-based budgets and year-end financial statements to the Chairman and to each member of the PHA Board of Commissioners, and to such other state and local public officials as HUD may specify.

      (c) Some or all of the project-based budgets and financial statements and information shall be required to be submitted to HUD in a manner and time prescribed by HUD.

      § 990.290   Compliance with asset management requirements.

#### § § 990.290

      (a) A PHA is considered in compliance with asset management requirements if it can demonstrate substantially, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, that it is managing according to this subpart.

      (b) Demonstration of compliance with asset management will be based on an independent assessment.

      (1) The assessment is to be conducted by a professional familiar with property management practices and costs in the region or state in which the PHA is located. This professional is to be procured by HUD.

      (2) The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination of compliance to asset management.

      (c) Upon HUD's determination of successful compliance with asset management, PHAs will then be funded based on this information pursuant to § 990.165(i).

      (d) PHAs must be in compliance with the project-based accounting and budgeting requirements in this subpart by FY 2007. PHAs must be in compliance with the remainder of the components of asset management by FY 2011.

    Subpart I—Operating Subsidy for Properties Managed by Resident Management Corporations (RMCs)

      § 990.295   Resident Management Corporation operating subsidy.

#### § § 990.295

      (a)  This part applies to all projects managed by a Resident Management Corporation (RMC), including a direct funded RMC.

      (b)  Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of operating subsidy that a PHA or HUD provides a project managed by an RMC shall not be reduced during the three-year period beginning on the date the RMC first assumes management responsibility for the project.

      (c)  The operating subsidy for an RMC-managed project shall reflect changes in inflation, utility rates, and consumption, as well as changes in the number of units in the resident managed project.

      (d)  Any increased income directly generated by activities by the RMC or facilities operated by the RMC shall be excluded from the calculation of the operating subsidy.

      (e)  Any technical assistance the PHA provides to the RMC will not be included for purposes of determining the amount of funds provided to a project under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (f) The following conditions may not affect the amounts to be provided under this part to a project managed by an RMC:

      (1)  Any reduction in the subsidy or total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the PHA; and

      (2)  Any change in the total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of project-specific characteristics when these characteristics are not shared by the project managed by the RMC.

      (g)  In addition to the operating subsidy calculated in accordance with this part and the amount of income derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges), the management contract between the PHA and the RMC may specify that income be provided to the project from other legally available sources of PHA income.

      § 990.300   Preparation of operating budget.

#### § § 990.300

      (a) The RMC and the PHA must submit operating budgets and calculations of operating subsidy to HUD for approval in accordance with § 990.200. The budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify the expenditures related to the responsibilities of the RMC and the expenditures that are related to the functions that the PHA will continue to perform.

      (b) For each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the RMC, the PHA will transfer into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the PHA an operating reserve for the RMC project. When all maintenance responsibilities for a resident-managed project are the responsibility of the RMC, the amount of the reserve made available to a project under this subpart will be the per-unit cost amount available to the PHA operating reserve, excluding all inventories, prepaids, and receivables at the end of the PHA fiscal year preceding implementation, multiplied by the number of units in the project operated. When some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the RMC, the management contract between the PHA and RMC may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the RMC's sub-account.

      (c) The RMC's use of the operating reserve is subject to all administrative procedures applicable to the conventionally owned public housing program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve must be for eligible expenditures that are incorporated into an operating budget subject to approval by HUD.

      (d) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with HUD regulations and guidance.

      § 990.305   Retention of excess revenues.

#### § § 990.305

      (a) Any income generated by an RMC that exceeds the income estimated for the income categories specified in the RMC's management contract must be excluded in subsequent years in calculating:

      (1) The operating subsidy provided to a PHA under this part; and

      (2) The funds the PHA provides to the RMC.

      (b) The RMC's management contract must specify the amount of income that is expected to be derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges) and the amount of income to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the PHA (such as operating subsidy under this part, interest income, administrative fees, and rents). These income estimates must be calculated consistent with HUD's administrative instructions. Income estimates may provide for adjustment of anticipated project income between the RMC and the PHA, based upon the management and other project-associated responsibilities (if any) that are to be retained by the PHA under the management contract.

      (c) Any revenues retained by an RMC under this section may be used only for purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the project, establishing business enterprises that employ residents of public housing, or acquiring additional dwelling units for lower income families. Units acquired by the RMC will not be eligible for payment of operating subsidy.

    Subpart J—Financial Management Systems, Monitoring, and Reporting

      § 990.310   Purpose—General policy on financial management, monitoring and reporting.

#### § § 990.310

      All PHA financial management systems, reporting, and monitoring of program performance and financial reporting shall be in compliance with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200. Certain HUD requirements provide exceptions for additional specialized procedures that are determined by HUD to be necessary for the proper management of the program in accordance with the requirements of the 1937 Act and the ACC between each PHA and HUD.

      § 990.315   Submission and approval of operating budgets.

#### § § 990.315

      (a) Required documentation:

      (1) Prior to the beginning of its fiscal year, a PHA shall prepare an operating budget in a manner prescribed by HUD. The PHA's Board of Commissioners shall review and approve the budget by resolution. Each fiscal year, the PHA shall submit to HUD, in a time and manner prescribed by HUD, the approved Board resolution.

      (2) HUD may direct the PHA to submit its complete operating budget with detailed supporting information and the Board resolution if the PHA has breached the ACC contract, or for other reasons, which, in HUD's determination, threaten the PHA's future serviceability, efficiency, economy, or stability. When the PHA no longer is operating in a manner that threatens the future serviceability, efficiency, economy, or stability of the housing it operates, HUD will notify the PHA that it no longer is required to submit a complete operating budget with detailed supporting information to HUD for review and approval.

      (b) If HUD finds that an operating budget is incomplete, inaccurate, includes illegal or ineligible expenditures, contains mathematical errors or errors in the application of accounting procedures, or is otherwise unacceptable, HUD may, at any time, require the PHA to submit additional or revised information regarding the budget or revised budget.

      § 990.320   Audits.

  PART 1000—NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ACTIVITIES

### Part 1000

**Authority:** Authority: 25 U.S.C. 4101  42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

**Source:** Source: 63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1000.1   What is the applicability and scope of these regulations?

#### § § 1000.1

      Under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 ) (NAHASDA) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides grants, loan guarantees, and technical assistance to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for the development and operation of low-income housing in Indian areas. The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible recipients under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. This part also applies to loan guarantee assistance under title VI of NAHASDA. The regulations in this part supplement the statutory requirements set forth in NAHASDA. This part, as much as practicable, does not repeat statutory language.

      § 1000.2   What are the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.2

      (a) The Secretary shall use the following Congressional findings set forth in section 2 of NAHASDA as the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA:

      (1) The Federal government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation:

      (i) By using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;

      (ii) By working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and

      (iii) By developing effective partnerships among the Federal government, state, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities.

      (2) There exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people.

      (3) The Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people.

      (4) The Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition.

      (5) Providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status.

      (6) The need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the federal government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for Indian tribes and their members.

      (7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450 ).

      (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as releasing the United States government from any responsibility arising under its trust responsibilities towards Indians or any treaty or treaties with an Indian tribe or nation.

> [63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 77 FR 71521, Dec. 3, 2012]

      § 1000.4   What are the objectives of NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.4

      The primary objectives of NAHASDA are:

      (a) To assist and promote affordable housing activities to develop, maintain and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by low-income Indian families;

      (b) To ensure better access to private mortgage markets for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;

      (c) To coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;

      (d) To plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for Indian tribes; and

      (e) To promote the development of private capital markets in Indian country and to allow such markets to operate and grow, thereby benefiting Indian communities.

      § 1000.6   What is the nature of the IHBG program?

#### § § 1000.6

      The IHBG program is formula driven whereby eligible recipients of funding receive an equitable share of appropriations made by the Congress, based upon formula components specified under subpart D of this part. IHBG recipients must have the administrative capacity to undertake the affordable housing activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.

      § 1000.8   May provisions of these regulations be waived?

#### § § 1000.8

      Yes. Upon determination of good cause, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this part and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)).

      § 1000.9   How is negotiated rulemaking conducted when promulgating NAHASDA regulations?

#### § § 1000.9

      The negotiated rulemaking procedures and requirements set out in section 106(b) of NAHASDA shall be conducted as follows:

      (a)  In forming a negotiated rulemaking committee, HUD shall appoint as committee members representatives of the Federal Government and representatives of diverse tribes and program recipients.

#### § § 1000.14

      The following relocation and real property acquisition policies are applicable to programs developed or operated under NAHASDA:

      (a)  The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the recipient does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall:

      (1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:

      (i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the recipient from accepting a donation or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value.

      (ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement.

      (2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property if the proposed acquisition payment exceeds the fair market value. The recipient shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and a justification for the proposed acquisition payment. HUD will promptly review the proposal and inform the recipient of its approval or disapproval.

      (b)  Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, recipients shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under this part.

      (c)  The following policies cover residential tenants and homebuyers who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such residential tenants and homebuyers shall be provided:

      (1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly housing costs (e.g., rent/utility costs).

      (2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:

      (i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;

      (ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;

      (iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the repairs; and

      (iv) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (d)  A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

      (e)  A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient.

      (f)  (1) The recipient shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The recipient shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with the provisions in this section.

      (2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the recipient from any other source.

      (3) The recipient shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.

      (g)  (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:

      (i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an IHP that is later approved.

      (ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, that the recipient determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

      (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

      (A) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or

      (B) 30 percent of gross household income.

      (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:

      (A) The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or

      (B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.

      (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:

      (A) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

      (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

      (i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the IHP to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project.

      (ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).

      (iii) The recipient determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

      (3) A recipient may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.

      (h)  For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition (See 49 CFR part 24).

      § 1000.16   What labor standards are applicable?

#### § § 1000.16

      (a)  (1) As described in section 104(b) of NAHASDA, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale, or lease under NAHASDA must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.

      (2) When NAHASDA assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NAHASDA assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.

      (3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.

      (b)  Section 104(b) also mandates that contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under NAHASDA require that prevailing wages determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable state, tribal or local law) by HUD shall be paid to maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, and to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development, of affordable housing.

      (c)  Contracts in excess of $100,000 to which Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply are subject by law to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).

      (d)  The requirements in 24 CFR part 70 concerning exemptions for the use of volunteers on projects subject to Davis-Bacon and HUD-determined wage rates are applicable.

      (e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall not apply to any contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease pursuant to NAHASDA, or to any contract for construction, development, operations, or maintenance thereunder, if such contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease is otherwise covered by one or more laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe that requires the payment of not less than prevailing wages, as determined by the Indian tribe. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall also not apply to work performed directly by tribal or TDHE employees under a contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease, that is covered by one or more such laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe.

      (f)  Recipients, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations issued under the labor standards provisions cited in this section, other applicable Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards, and HUD Handbook 1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs).

      § 1000.18   What environmental review requirements apply?

#### § § 1000.18

      The environmental effects of each activity carried out with assistance under this part must be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and the related authorities listed in HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. An environmental review does not have to be completed prior to HUD approval of an IHP.

      § 1000.20   Is an Indian tribe required to assume environmental review responsibilities?

#### § § 1000.20

      (a) No. It is an option an Indian tribe may choose. If an Indian tribe declines to assume the environmental review responsibilities, HUD will perform the environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. The timing of HUD undertaking the environmental review will be subject to the availability of resources. A HUD environmental review must be completed for any NAHASDA assisted activities not excluded from review under 24 CFR 50.19(b) before a recipient may acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair or construct property, or commit HUD or local funds used in conjunction with such NAHASDA assisted activities with respect to the property.

      (b) If an Indian tribe assumes environmental review responsibilities:

      (1) Its certifying officer must certify that he/she is authorized and consents on behalf of the Indian tribe and such officer to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal courts for the purpose of enforcement of the responsibilities of the certifying officer as set forth in section 105(c) of NAHASDA; and

      (2) The Indian tribe must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 58.

      (3) No funds may be committed to a grant activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification required by sections 105(b) and 105(c) of NAHASDA, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58 such as for the costs of environmental reviews and other planning and administrative expenses.

      (c) Where an environmental assessment (EA) is appropriate under 24 CFR part 50, instead of an Indian tribe assuming environmental review responsibilities under paragraph (b) of this section or HUD preparing the EA itself under paragraph (a) of this section, an Indian tribe or TDHE may prepare an EA for HUD review. In addition to complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 1506.5(a), HUD shall make its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take responsibility for the scope and content of the EA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b).

      § 1000.21   Under what circumstances are waivers of the environmental review procedures available to tribes?

#### § § 1000.21

      A tribe or recipient may request that the Secretary waive the requirements under section 105 of NAHASDA. The Secretary may grant the waiver if the Secretary determines that a failure on the part of a recipient to comply with provisions of this section:

      (a) Will not frustrate the goals of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 ) or any other provision of law that furthers the goals of that Act;

      (b) Does not threaten the health or safety of the community involved by posing an immediate or long-term hazard to residents of that community;

      (c) Is a result of inadvertent error, including an incorrect or incomplete certification provided under section 105(c)(1) of NAHASDA; and

      (d) May be corrected through the sole action of the recipient.

> [77 FR 71522, Dec. 3, 2012]

      § 1000.22   Are the costs of the environmental review an eligible cost?

#### § § 1000.22

      Yes, costs of completing the environmental review are eligible.

      § 1000.24   If an Indian tribe assumes environmental review responsibility, how will HUD assist the Indian tribe in performing the environmental review?

#### § § 1000.24

      As set forth in section 105(a)(2)(B) of NAHASDA and 24 CFR 58.77, HUD will provide for monitoring of environmental reviews and will also facilitate training for the performance for such reviews by Indian tribes.

      § 1000.26   What are the administrative requirements under NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.26

      (a) Except as addressed in § 1000.28, recipients shall comply with the requirements and standards of 2 CFR part 200, “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, And Audit Requirements for Federal Awards”, except for the following sections:

      § 1000.120   May a recipient use Indian preference or tribal preference in selecting families for housing assistance?

#### § § 1000.120

      Yes. The IHP may set out a preference for the provision of housing assistance to Indian families who are members of the Indian tribe or to other Indian families if the recipient has adopted the preference in its admissions policy. The recipient shall ensure that housing activities funded under NAHASDA are subject to the preference.

      § 1000.122   May NAHASDA grant funds be used as matching funds to obtain and leverage funding, including any Federal or state program and still be considered an affordable housing activity?

#### § § 1000.122

      There is no prohibition in NAHASDA against using grant funds as matching funds.

      § 1000.124   What maximum and minimum rent or homebuyer payment can a recipient charge a low-income rental tenant or homebuyer residing in housing units assisted with NAHASDA grant amounts?

#### § § 1000.124

      A recipient can charge a low-income rental tenant or homebuyer rent or homebuyer payments not to exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the family. The recipient may also decide to compute its rental and homebuyer payments on any lesser percentage of adjusted income of the family. This requirement applies only to units assisted with NAHASDA grant amounts. NAHASDA does not set minimum rents or homebuyer payments; however, a recipient may do so.

      § 1000.126   May a recipient charge flat or income-adjusted rents?

#### § § 1000.126

      Yes, providing the rental or homebuyer payment of the low-income family does not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted income.

      § 1000.128   Is income verification required for assistance under NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.128

      (a) Yes, the recipient must verify that the family is income eligible based on anticipated annual income. The family is required to provide documentation to verify this determination. The recipient is required to maintain the documentation on which the determination of eligibility is based.

      (b) The recipient may require a family to periodically verify its income in order to determine housing payments or continued occupancy consistent with locally adopted policies. When income verification is required, the family must provide documentation which verifies its income, and this documentation must be retained by the recipient.

      § 1000.130   May a recipient charge a non low-income family rents or homebuyer payments which are more than 30 percent of the family's adjusted income?

#### § § 1000.130

      Yes. A recipient may charge a non low-income family rents or homebuyer payments which are more than 30 percent of the family's adjusted income.

      § 1000.132   Are utilities considered a part of rent or homebuyer payments?

#### § § 1000.132

      Utilities may be considered a part of rent or homebuyer payments if a recipient decides to define rent or homebuyer payments to include utilities in its written policies on rents and homebuyer payments required by section 203(a)(1) of NAHASDA. A recipient may define rents and homebuyer payments to exclude utilities.

      § 1000.134   When may a recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) demolish or dispose of current assisted stock?

#### § § 1000.134

      (a) A recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) may undertake a planned demolition or disposal of current assisted stock owned by the recipient or an entity funded by the recipient when:

      (1) A financial analysis demonstrates that it is more cost-effective or housing program-effective for the recipient to demolish or dispose of the unit than to continue to operate or own it; or

      (2) The housing unit has been condemned by the government which has authority over the unit; or

      (3) The housing unit is an imminent threat to the health and safety of housing residents; or

      (4) Continued habitation of a housing unit is inadvisable due to cultural or historical considerations.

      (b) No action to demolish or dispose of the property other than performing the analysis cited in paragraph (a) of this section can be taken until HUD has been notified in writing of the recipient's intent to demolish or dispose of the housing units consistent with section 102(c)(4)(H) of NAHASDA. The written notification must set out the analysis used to arrive at the decision to demolish or dispose of the property and may be set out in a recipient's IHP or in a separate submission to HUD.

      (c) In any disposition sale of a housing unit, a sale process designed to maximize the sale price will be used. However, where the sale is to a low-income Indian family, the home may be disposed of without maximizing the sale price so long as such price is consistent with a recipient's IHP. The sale proceeds from the disposition of any housing unit are program income under NAHASDA and must be used in accordance with the requirements of NAHASDA and these regulations.

      § 1000.136   What insurance requirements apply to housing units assisted with NAHASDA grants?

#### § § 1000.136

      (a) The recipient shall provide adequate insurance either by purchasing insurance or by indemnification against casualty loss by providing insurance in adequate amounts to indemnify the recipient against loss from fire, weather, and liability claims for all housing units owned or operated by the recipient.

      (b) The recipients shall not require insurance on units assisted by grants to families for privately owned housing if there is no risk of loss or exposure to the recipient or if the assistance is in an amount less than $5000, but will require insurance when repayment of all or part of the assistance is part of the assistance agreement.

      (c) The recipient shall require contractors and subcontractors to either provide insurance covering their activities or negotiate adequate indemnification coverage to be provided by the recipient in the contract.

      (d) These requirements are in addition to applicable flood insurance requirements under § 1000.38.

      § 1000.138   What constitutes adequate insurance?

#### § § 1000.138

      Insurance is adequate if it is a purchased insurance policy from an insurance provider or a plan of self-insurance in an amount that will protect the financial stability of the recipient's IHBG program. Recipients may purchase the required insurance without regard to competitive selection procedures from nonprofit insurance entities which are owned and controlled by recipients and which have been approved by HUD.

      § 1000.139   What are the standards for insurance entities owned and controlled by recipients?

#### § § 1000.139

Any material changes made to these documents after initial approval must be submitted to HUD. Adverse material changes may cause HUD to revoke its approval of a self-insurance entity. The application submitted to HUD must show that:

      (1) The plan is organized as an insurance entity, tribal self-insurance plan, tribal risk retention group, or Indian housing self-insurance risk pool;

      (2) The plan limits participation to IHBG recipients;

      (3) The plan operates on a nonprofit basis;

      (4)(i) The plan employs or contracts with a third party to provide competent underwriting and management staff;

      (A) The underwriting staff must be composed of insurance professionals with an average of at least five years of experience in large risk commercial underwriting exceeding $100,000 in annual premiums or at least five years of experience in underwriting risks for public entity plans of self-insurance;

      (B) The management staff must have at least one senior manager who has a minimum of five years of insurance experience at the level of vice president of a property or casualty insurance entity; as a senior branch manager of a branch office with annual property or casualty premiums exceeding five million dollars; or as a senior manager of a public entity self-insurance risk pool;

      (ii) Satisfaction of this requirement may be demonstrated by evidence such as résumés and employment history of the underwriting staff for the plan and of the key management staff with day-to-day operational oversight of the plan;

      (5) The plan maintains internal controls and cost containment measures, as shown by the annual budget;

      (6) The plan maintains sound investments consistent with its articles of incorporation, charter, bylaws, risk pool agreement, or other applicable organizational document or agreement concerning investments;

      (7) The plan maintains adequate surplus and reserves, as determined by HUD, for undischarged liabilities of all types, as shown by a current audited financial statement and an actuarial review conducted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

      (8) The plan has proper organizational documentation, as shown by copies of the articles of incorporation, charter, bylaws, subscription agreement, business plan, contracts with third-party administrators, and other organizational documents; and

      (9) A plan's first successful application for approval under this section must also include an opinion from the plan's legal counsel that the plan is properly chartered, incorporated, or otherwise formed under applicable law.

      (d)  HUD will consider an application for approval of a self-insurance plan submitted under this section and approve or disapprove that application no later than 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete application. If an application is disapproved, HUD shall notify the applicant of the reasons for disapproval and may offer technical assistance to a recipient to help the recipient correct the deficiencies in the application. The recipient may then resubmit the application under this section.

      (e)  An approved plan must undergo an audit and actuarial review annually. In addition, an evaluation of the plan's management must be performed by an insurance professional every three years. These audits, actuarial reviews, and management reviews must be submitted to HUD within 90 days after the end of the insuring entity's fiscal year and be prepared in accordance with the following standards:

      (1) The annual financial statement must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The independent auditor shall state in writing an opinion on whether the plan's financial statement is presented fairly, in accordance with GAAP;

      (2) The actuarial review of the plan shall be done consistently with requirements established by the Association of Governmental Risk Pools and conducted by an independent property or casualty actuary who is a member of a recognized professional actuarial organization, such as the American Academy of Actuaries. The report issued and submitted to HUD must include the actuary's written opinion on any over- or under-reserving and the adequacy of the reserve maintained for open claims and for incurred but unreported claims;

      (3) The management review must be prepared by an independent insurance consultant who has received the professional designation of a chartered property/casualty underwriter (CPCU), associate in risk management (ARM), or associate in claims (AIC), and must cover the following:

      (ii) Timeliness of the claim payments and reserving practices; and

      (iii) The adequacy of reinsurance or excess insurance coverage.

The plan's management will be notified in writing of the proposed revocation of its approval and of the manner and time in which to request a hearing to challenge the determination, in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this part for model housing activities (§ 1000.118).

      (g)  In order that tribally owned Indian housing insurance entities that provide insurance for IHBG-assisted housing will not be subject to conflicting state laws and widely varying and costly requirements, any self-insurance plan under this section that meets the requirements of this section and that has been approved by HUD shall be governed by the regulations of this subpart in its provision of insurance for IHBG-assisted housing.

      Yes. Affordable housing must be of moderate design. For these purposes, moderate design is defined as housing that is of a size and with amenities consistent with unassisted housing offered for sale in the Indian tribe's general geographic area to buyers who are at or below the area median income. The local determination of moderate design applies to all housing assisted under an affordable housing activity, including development activities ( acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing and homebuyer assistance) and model activities. Acquisition includes assistance to a family to buy housing. Units with the same number of bedrooms must be comparable with respect to size, cost and amenities.

      § 1000.158   How will a NAHASDA grant recipient know that the housing assisted under the IHBG program meets the requirements of § 1000.156?

#### § § 1000.158

      (a) A recipient must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if an assisted housing project meets the moderate design requirements of § 1000.156. For purposes of this requirement, a project is one or more housing units, of comparable size, cost, amenities and design, developed with assistance provided by the Act.

      (b) The recipient may adopt written standards for its affordable housing programs that reflect the requirement specified in § 1000.156. The standards must describe the type of housing, explain the basis for the standards, and use similar housing in the Indian tribe's general geographic area. For each affordable housing project, the recipient must maintain documentation substantiating compliance with the adopted housing standards. The standards and documentation substantiating compliance for each activity must be available for review by the general public and, upon request, by HUD. Prior to awarding a contract for the construction of housing or beginning construction using its own workforce, the recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC discussed in paragraph (c) of this section and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed by more than 10 percent the TDC maximum cost for the project. In developing standards under this paragraph, the recipient must establish, maintain, and follow policies that determine a local definition of moderate design which considers:

      (1) Gross area;

      (2) Total cost to provide the housing;

      (3) Environmental concerns and mitigations;

      (4) Climate;

      (5) Comparable housing in geographical area;

      (6) Local codes, ordinances and standards;

      (7) Cultural relevance in design;

      (8) Design and construction features that are reasonable, and necessary to provide decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing; and

      (9) Design and construction features that are accessible to persons with a variety of disabilities.

      (c) If the recipient has not adopted housing standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Total Development Cost (TDC) limits published periodically by HUD establish the maximum amount of funds (from all sources) that the recipient may use to develop or acquire/rehabilitate affordable housing. The recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed the TDC maximum cost for the project.

> [66 FR 49790, Sept. 28, 2001]

      § 1000.162   How will a recipient know that non-dwelling structures assisted under the IHBG program meet the requirements of 1000.160?

#### § § 1000.162

      (a) The recipient must use one of the methods described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if a non-dwelling structure meets the limitation requirements of § 1000.160. If the recipient develops, acquires, or rehabilitates a non-dwelling structure with funds from NAHASDA and other sources, then the cost limit standard established under these regulations applies to the entire structure. If funds are used from two different sources, the standards of the funding source with the more restrictive rules apply.

      (b)(1) The recipient may adopt written standards for non-dwelling structures. The standards must describe the type of structures and must clearly describe the criteria to be used to guide the cost, size, design, features, amenities, performance or other factors. The standards for such structures must be able to support the reasonableness and necessity for these factors and to clearly identify the affordable housing activity that is being provided.

      (2) When the recipient applies a standard to particular structures, it must document the following: (i) Identification of targeted population to benefit from the structures;

      (ii) Identification of need or problem to be solved;

      (iii) Affordable housing activity provided or supported by the structures;

      (iv) Alternatives considered;

      (v) Provision for future growth and change;

      (vi) Cultural relevance of design;

      (vii) Size and scope supported by population and need;

      (viii) Design and construction features that are accessible to persons with a variety of disabilities;

      (ix) Cost; and

      (x) Compatibility with community infrastructure and services.

      (c) If the recipient has not adopted program standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then it must demonstrate and document that the non-dwelling structure is of a cost, size, design and with amenities consistent with similarly designed and constructed structures in the recipient's general geographic area.

      § 1000.204   How does an Indian tribe designate itself as recipient of the grant?

#### § § 1000.204

      (a) By resolution of the Indian tribe; or

      (b) When such authority has been delegated by an Indian tribe's governing body to a tribal committee(s), by resolution or other written form used by such committee(s) to memorialize the decisions of that body, if applicable.

      § 1000.206   How is a TDHE designated?

#### § § 1000.206

      (a)(1) By resolution of the Indian tribe or Indian tribes to be served; or

      (2) When such authority has been delegated by an Indian tribe's governing body to a tribal committee(s), by resolution or other written form used by such committee(s) to memorialize the decisions of that body, if applicable.

      (b) In the absence of a designation by the Indian tribe, the default designation as provided in section 4(21) of NAHASDA shall apply.

      § 1000.208   What happens if an Indian tribe had two IHAs as of September 30, 1996?

#### § § 1000.208

      Indian tribes which had established and were operating two IHAs as of September 30, 1996, under the 1937 Act shall be allowed to form and operate two TDHEs under NAHASDA. Nothing in this section shall affect the allocation of funds otherwise due to an Indian tribe under the formula.

      § 1000.210   What happens to existing 1937 Act units in those jurisdictions for which Indian tribes do not or cannot submit an IHP?

#### § § 1000.210

      NAHASDA does not provide the statutory authority for HUD to grant NAHASDA grant funds to an Indian housing authority, Indian tribe or to a default TDHE which cannot obtain a tribal certification, if the requisite IHP is not submitted by an Indian tribe or is determined to be out of compliance by HUD. There may be circumstances where this may happen, and in those cases, other methods of tribal, Federal, or private market support may have to be sought to maintain and operate those 1937 Act units.

      § 1000.212   Is submission of an IHP required?

#### § § 1000.212

      Yes. An Indian tribe or, with the consent of its Indian tribe(s), the TDHE, must submit an IHP to HUD to receive funding under NAHASDA, except as provided in section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If a TDHE has been designated by more than one Indian tribe, the TDHE can submit a separate IHP for each Indian tribe or it may submit a single IHP based on the requirements of § 1000.220 with the approval of the Indian tribes.

      § 1000.214   What is the deadline for submission of an IHP?

#### § § 1000.214

      IHPs must be initially sent by the recipient to the Area ONAP no later than 75 days before the beginning of a tribal program year. Grant funds cannot be provided until the plan due under this section is determined to be in compliance with section 102 of NAHASDA and funds are available.

      § 1000.216   What happens if the recipient does not submit the IHP to the Area ONAP by no later than 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year?

#### § § 1000.216

      If the IHP is not initially sent by at least 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year, the recipient will not be eligible for IHBG funds for that fiscal year. Any funds not obligated because an IHP was not received before this deadline has passed shall be distributed by formula in the following year.

      § 1000.218   Who prepares and submits an IHP?

#### § § 1000.218

      An Indian tribe, or with the authorization of a Indian tribe, in accordance with section 102(d) of NAHASDA a TDHE may prepare and submit a plan to HUD.

      § 1000.220   What are the requirements for the IHP?

#### § § 1000.220

      The IHP requirements are set forth in section 102(b) of NAHASDA. In addition, §§ 1000.56, 1000.108, 1000.120, 1000.134, 1000.142, 1000.238, 1000.302, and 1000.328 require or permit additional items to be set forth in the IHP for HUD determinations required by those sections. Recipients are only required to provide IHPs that contain these elements in a form prescribed by HUD. If a TDHE is submitting a single IHP that covers two or more Indian tribes, the IHP must contain a separate certification in accordance with section 102(d) of NAHASDA and IHP Tables for each Indian tribe when requested by such Indian tribes. However, Indian tribes are encouraged to perform comprehensive housing needs assessments and develop comprehensive IHPs and not limit their planning process to only those housing efforts funded by NAHASDA. An IHP should be locally driven.

      § 1000.222   Are there separate IHP requirements for small Indian tribes and small TDHEs?

#### § § 1000.222

      No. HUD requirements for IHPs are reasonable.

      § 1000.224   Can any part of the IHP be waived?

#### § § 1000.224

      Yes. HUD has general authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA to waive any IHP requirements when an Indian tribe cannot comply with IHP requirements due to exigent circumstances beyond its control, for a period of not more than 90 days. The waiver authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA provides flexibility to address the needs of every Indian tribe, including small Indian tribes. The waiver may be requested by the Indian tribe or its TDHE (if such authority is delegated by the Indian tribe), and such waiver shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      § 1000.225   When may a waiver of the IHP submission deadline be requested?

#### § § 1000.225

      A recipient may request a waiver for a period of not more than 90 days beyond the IHP submission due date.

> [77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]

      § 1000.226   Can the certification requirements of section 102(c)(5) of NAHASDA be waived by HUD?

#### § § 1000.226

      Yes. HUD may waive these certification requirements as provided in section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA.

      § 1000.227   What shall HUD do upon receipt of an IHP submission deadline waiver request?

#### § § 1000.227

      The waiver shall be decided upon by HUD within 45 days of receipt of the waiver request. HUD shall notify the recipient in writing within 45 days of receipt of the waiver request whether the request is approved or denied.

      § 1000.228   If HUD changes its IHP format will Indian tribes be involved?

#### § § 1000.228

      Yes. HUD will first consult with Indian tribes before making any substantial changes to HUD's IHP format.

      § 1000.230   What is the process for HUD review of IHPs and IHP amendments?

#### § § 1000.230

      HUD will conduct the IHP review in the following manner:

      (a) HUD will conduct a limited review of the IHP to ensure that its contents:

      (1) Comply with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA, which outlines the IHP submission requirements; however, the recipient may use either the HUD-estimated IHBG amount or the IHBG amount from their most recent compliant IHP;

      (2) Are consistent with information and data available to HUD;

      (3) Are not prohibited by or inconsistent with any provision of NAHASDA or other applicable law; and

      (4) Include the appropriate certifications.

      (b) If the IHP complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of IHP compliance within 60 days after receiving the IHP. If HUD fails to notify the recipient, the IHP shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA and the IHP is approved.

      (c) If the submitted IHP does not comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of the determination of non-compliance. HUD will provide this notice no later than 60 days after receiving the IHP. This notice will set forth:

      (1) The reasons for noncompliance;

      (2) The modifications necessary for the IHP to meet the submission requirements; and

      (3) The date by which the revised IHP must be submitted.

      (d) If the recipient does not submit a revised IHP by the date indicated in the notice provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the IHP will be determined by HUD to be in non-compliance unless a waiver is requested and approved under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the IHP is determined by HUD to be in non-compliance and no waiver is granted, the recipient may appeal this determination following the appeal process in § 1000.234.

      (e)(1) If the IHP does not contain the certifications identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the recipient will be notified within 60 days of submission of the IHP that the plan is incomplete. The notification will include a date by which the certification must be submitted.

      (2) If the recipient has not complied or cannot comply with the certification requirements due to circumstances beyond the control of the Indian tribe(s), within the timeframe established, the recipient can request a waiver in accordance with section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the waiver is approved, the recipient is eligible to receive its grant in accordance with any conditions of the waiver.

      § 1000.232   Can an Indian tribe or TDHE amend its IHP?

#### § § 1000.232

      Yes. Section 103(c) of NAHASDA specifically provides that a recipient may submit modifications or revisions of its IHP to HUD. Unless the initial IHP certification provided by an Indian tribe allowed for the submission of IHP amendments without further tribal certifications, a tribal certification must accompany submission of IHP amendments by a TDHE to HUD. HUD's review of an amendment and determination of compliance will be limited to modifications of an IHP which adds new activities or involve a decrease in the amount of funds provided to protect and maintain the viability of housing assisted under the 1937 Act. HUD will consider these modifications to the IHP in accordance with § 1000.230. HUD will act on amended IHPs within 30 days.

      § 1000.234   Can HUD's determination regarding the non-compliance of an IHP or a modification to an IHP be appealed?

#### § § 1000.234

      (a) Yes. Within 30 days of receiving HUD's disapproval of an IHP or of a modification to an IHP, the recipient may submit a written request for reconsideration of the determination. The request shall include the justification for the reconsideration.

      (b) Within 21 days of receiving the request, HUD shall reconsider its initial determination and provide the recipient with written notice of its decision to affirm, modify, or reverse its initial determination. This notice will also contain the reasons for HUD's decision.

      (c) The recipient may appeal any denial of reconsideration by filing an appeal with the Assistant Secretary within 21 days of receiving the denial. The appeal shall set forth the reasons why the recipient does not agree with HUD's decision and include justification for the reconsideration.

      (d) Within 21 days of receipt of the appeal, the Assistant Secretary shall review the recipient's appeal and act on the appeal. The Assistant Secretary will provide written notice to the recipient setting forth the reasons for the decision. The Assistant Secretary's decision constitutes final agency action.

      § 1000.236   What are eligible administrative and planning expenses?

#### § § 1000.236

      (a) Eligible administrative and planning expenses of the IHBG program include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Costs of overall program and/or administrative management;

      (2) Coordination monitoring and evaluation;

      (3) Preparation of the IHP including data collection and transition costs;

      (4) Preparation of the annual performance report;

      (5) Challenge to and collection of data for purposes of challenging the formula; and

      (6) Administrative and planning expenses associated with expenditure of non-IHBG funds on affordable housing activities if the source of the non-IHBG funds limits expenditure of its funds on such administrative expenses.

      (b) Staff and overhead costs directly related to carrying out affordable housing activities or comprehensive and community development planning activities can be determined to be eligible costs of the affordable housing activity or considered as administration or planning at the discretion of the recipient.

      § 1000.238   What percentage of the IHBG funds can be used for administrative and planning expenses?

#### § § 1000.238

      Recipients receiving in excess of $500,000 may use up to 20 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or may use up to 20 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. Recipients receiving $500,000 or less may use up to 30 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or up to 30 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. When a recipient is receiving grant funds on behalf of one or more grant beneficiaries, the recipient may use up to 30 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 30 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is $500,000 or less, and up to 20 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 20 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is greater than $500,000. HUD approval is required if a higher percentage is requested by the recipient. Recipients combining grant funds with other funding may request HUD approval to use a higher percentage based on its total expenditure of funds from all sources for that year. When HUD approval is required, HUD must take into consideration any cost of preparing the IHP, challenges to and collection of data, the recipient's grant amount, approved cost allocation plans, and any other relevant information with special consideration given to the circumstances of recipients receiving minimal funding.

> [77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]

      § 1000.239   May a recipient establish and maintain reserve accounts for administration and planning?

#### § § 1000.239

      Yes. In addition to the amounts established for planning and administrative expenses under §§ 1000.236 and 1000.238, a recipient may establish and maintain separate reserve accounts only for the purpose of accumulating amounts for administration and planning relating to affordable housing activities. These amounts may be invested in accordance with § 1000.58(c). Interest earned on reserves is not program income and shall not be included in calculating the maximum amount of reserves. The maximum amount of reserves, whether in one or more accounts, that a recipient may have available at any one time is calculated as follows:

      (a) Determine the 5-year average of administration and planning amounts, not including reserve amounts, expended in a tribal program year.

      (b) Establish   of that amount for the total eligible reserve.

      § 1000.240   When is a local cooperation agreement required for affordable housing activities?

#### § § 1000.240

      The requirement for a local cooperation agreement applies only to rental and lease-purchase homeownership units assisted with IHBG funds which are owned by the Indian tribe or TDHE.

      § 1000.242   When does the requirement for exemption from taxation apply to affordable housing activities?

#### § § 1000.242

      The requirement for exemption from taxation applies only to rental and lease-purchase homeownership units assisted with IHBG funds which are owned by the Indian tribe or TDHE.

      § 1000.244   If the recipient has made a good-faith effort to negotiate a cooperation agreement and tax-exempt status but has been unsuccessful through no fault of its own, may the Secretary waive the requirement for a cooperation agreement and a tax exemption?

#### § § 1000.244

      Yes. Recipients must submit a written request for waiver to the recipient's Area ONAP. The request must detail a good faith effort by the recipient, identify the housing units involved, and include all pertinent background information about the housing units. The recipient must further demonstrate that it has pursued and exhausted all reasonable channels available to it to reach an agreement to obtain tax-exempt status, and that failure to obtain the required agreement and tax-exempt status has been through no fault of its own. The Area ONAP will forward the request, its recommendation, comments, and any additional relevant documentation to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native American Programs for processing to the Assistant Secretary.

    Subpart D—Allocation Formula

      § 1000.301   What is the purpose of the IHBG formula?

#### § § 1000.301

      The IHBG formula is used to allocate equitably and fairly funds made available through NAHASDA among eligible Indian tribes. A TDHE may be a recipient on behalf of an Indian tribe.

      § 1000.302   What are the definitions applicable for the IHBG formula?

#### § § 1000.302

      In rental projects, AEL is the per-unit per-month dollar amount of expenses which was used to compute the amount of operating subsidy used prior to October 1, 1997 for the Low Rent units developed under the 1937 Act. The “AEL factor” is the relative difference between a local area AEL and the national weighted average for AEL.

      means the last day of the month in which substantially all the units in a housing development are available for occupancy.

      are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent plus the cost of all utilities, except telephones. HUD estimates FMRs on an annual basis for 354 metropolitan FMR areas and 2,355 non-metropolitan county FMR areas. The “FMR factor” is the relative difference between a local area FMR and the national weighted average for FMR.

      For purposes of the IHBG formula, annual income is a household's total income as currently defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

      (1) Formula areas are:

      (i) Reservations for federally recognized Indian tribes, as defined by the U.S. Census;

      (ii) Trust lands;

      (iii) Department of the Interior Near-Reservation Service Areas;

      (iv) Former Indian Reservation Areas in Oklahoma Indian Areas, as defined by the U.S. Census as Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas (OTSAs);

      (v) Congressionally Mandated Service Areas;

      (vi) State Tribal Areas as defined by the U.S. Census as State Designated American Indian Statistical Areas (SDAISAs);

      (vii) Tribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs);

      (viii) California Tribal Jurisdictional Areas established or reestablished by federal court judgment; and

      (ix) Alaska formula areas described in paragraph (4) of this definition.

      (2)(i) For a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, and for expansion or re-definition of a geographic area from the prior year, including those identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, the Indian tribe must submit, on a form agreed to by HUD, information about the geographic area it wishes to include in its Formula Area, including proof that the Indian tribe, where applicable, has agreed to provide housing services pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the tribal and public governing entity or entities of the area, or has attempted to establish such an MOA, and is providing substantial housing services and will continue to expend or obligate funds for substantial housing services, as reflected in its Indian Housing Plan and Annual Performance Report for this purpose.

      (ii) Upon receiving a request for recognition of a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, HUD shall make a preliminary determination. HUD shall notify all potentially affected Indian tribes of the basis for its preliminary determination by certified mail and provide the Indian tribes with the opportunity to comment for a period of not less than 90 days. After consideration of the comments, HUD shall announce its final determination through  notice.

      (iii) No Indian tribe may expand or redefine its Formula Area without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) of this definition, notwithstanding any changes recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau.

      (iv) The geographic area into which an Indian tribe may expand under this paragraph (2) shall be the smallest U.S. Census unit or units encompassing the physical location where substantial housing services have been provided by the Indian tribe.

      (3) Subject to a challenge by an Indian tribe with a Formula Area described under paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition, any federally recognized Indian tribe assigned Formula Area geography in Fiscal Year 2003 not identified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, shall continue to be assigned such Formula Area in subsequent fiscal years, provided that the Indian tribe continues to provide an appropriate level of housing services within the Formula Area as monitored by HUD using the definition of substantial housing services contained in this section as a guideline but not as a requirement.

      (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this definition, Alaska needs data shall be credited as set forth in § 1000.327 to the Alaska Native Village (ANV), the regional Indian tribe, or to the regional corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (33 U.S.C. 1601 ) (ANCSA). For purposes of § 1000.327 and this definition:

      (i) The formula area of the ANV shall be the geographic area of the village or that area delineated by the TDSA established for the ANV for purposes of the 1990 U.S. Census or the Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA) established for the ANV. To the extent that the area encompassed by such designation may substantially exceed the actual geographic area of the village, such designation is subject to challenge pursuant to § 1000.336. If the ANVSA or the TDSA is determined pursuant to such challenge to substantially exceed the actual area of the village, then the geographic formula area of the ANV for purposes of § 1000.327 shall be such U.S. Census designation as most closely approximates the actual geographic area of the village.

      (ii) The geographic formula area of the regional corporation shall be the area established for the corporation by the ANCSA.

      (iii) An Indian tribe may seek to expand its Alaska formula area within its ANCSA region pursuant to the procedures set out in paragraph (2) of this definition. Formula Area added in this way shall be treated as overlapping pursuant to § 1000.326, unless the Indian tribe's members in the expanded area are less than 50 percent of the AIAN population. In cases where the Indian tribe is not treated as overlapping, the Indian tribe shall be credited with population and housing data only for its own tribal member residents within the new or added area. All other population and housing data for the area shall remain with the Indian tribe or tribes previously credited with such data.

      (5) In some cases the population data for an Indian tribe within its Formula Area is greater than its tribal enrollment. In general, to maintain fairness for all Indian tribes, the tribe's population data will not be allowed to exceed twice an Indian tribe's enrolled population. However, an Indian tribe subject to this cap may receive an allocation based on more than twice its total enrollment if it can show that it is providing housing assistance to substantially more non-member Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of another federally recognized Indian tribe than it is to members. For state-recognized Indian tribes, the population data and formula allocation shall be limited to their tribal enrollment figures as determined under enrollment criteria in effect in 1996.

      (6) In cases where an Indian tribe is seeking to receive an allocation more than twice its total enrollment, the tribal enrollment multiplier will be determined by the total number of Indians and Alaska Natives to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance (on July 30 of the year before funding is sought) divided by the number of members to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance. For example, an Indian tribe that provides housing to 300 Indians and Alaska Natives, of which 100 are members, the Indian tribe would then be able to receive an allocation for up to three times its tribal enrollment if the Indian and Alaska Native population in the area is three or more times the tribal enrollment.

      For purposes of the formula median income is determined in accordance with section 567 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 1437a note).

      is the form recipients use to report changes to their Formula Current Assisted stock, formula area, and other formula related information before each year's formula allocation.

      means a homeownership program where title rests with the homebuyer and a security interest rests with the IHA.

      means a lease with option to purchase contract between an IHA and a homebuyer under the 1937 Act.

      is the Fiscal Year 1996 national per unit subsidy (adjusted to full funding level) multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation.

      means households with more than 1.01 persons per room as defined by the U.S. Decennial Census.

      means the making of housing assistance payments to eligible families leasing existing housing pursuant to the provisions of the 1937 Act.

      means the contract annualized housing assistance payments (vouchers, and project based) under the Section 8 program.

      are:

      (1) Affordable housing activities funded from any source provided to AIAN households with incomes 80 percent of the median income as defined in NAHASDA (25 U.S.C. 4103 (14)) or lower, equivalent to 100 percent or more of the increase in the IHBG formula allocation that the Indian tribe would receive as a result of adding the proposed geography; or

      (2) Affordable housing activities funded with IHBG funds provided to AIAN households with incomes 80 percent of the median income as defined in NAHASDA (25 U.S.C. 4104(14)) or lower, equivalent to 51 percent or more of the Indian tribe's current total IHBG grant; and either:

      (i) Fifty-one percent or more of the Indian tribe's official enrollment resides within the geographic area; or

      (ii) The Indian tribe's official enrollment constitutes 51 percent or more of the total AIAN persons within the geography.

      (3) HUD shall require that the Indian tribe annually provide written verification, in its Indian Housing Plan and Annual Performance Report, that the affordable housing activities it is providing meet the definition of substantial housing services.

      is the sum of all costs for a project including all undertakings necessary for administration, planning, site acquisition, demolition, construction or equipment and financing (including payment of carrying charges) and for otherwise carrying out the development of the project, excluding off site water and sewer. Total Development Cost amounts will be based on a moderately designed house and will be determined by averaging the current construction costs as listed in not less than two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices.

      means, as defined by the U.S. Decennial Census, an occupied house without one or more of the following items:

      (1) Hot and cold piped water;

      (2) A flush toilet;

      (3) A bathtub or shower;

      (4) A sink with piped water;

      (5) A range or cookstove; or

      (6) A refrigerator.

      § 1000.316   How is the Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) Component developed?

#### § § 1000.316

      The Formula Current Assisted Stock component consists of two elements. They are:

      (a)  The operating subsidy consists of three variables which are:

      (1) The number of low-rent FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy;

      (2) The number of Section 8 units whose contract has expired but had been under contract on September 30, 1997, multiplied by the FY 1996 national per unit subsidy; and

      (3) The number of Mutual Help and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy.

      (b)  (1) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated 250 or more public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per-unit amount of allocation for FY 1996 modernization multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation.

      (2) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated fewer than 250 public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the average amount of funds received under the assistance program authorized by section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including funds provided as emergency assistance) for FYs 1992 through 1997.

      (c)  Conversion of FCAS units from homeownership (Mutual Help or Turnkey III) to low-rent or from low-rent to a home ownership program.

      (1) If units were converted before October 1, 1997, as evidenced by an amended ACC, then those units will be counted for formula funding and eligibility purposes as the type of unit to which they were converted.

      (2) If units were converted on or after October 1, 1997, the following applies:

      (i)  Units that converted after October 1, 1997 will be funded as the type of unit specified on the original ACC in effect on September 30, 1997.

      (ii)  Whether or not it is the first conversion, a unit converted after October 1, 1997, will be considered as the type converted to when determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to low-rent will be treated as a low-rent unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to homeownership will be treated as a homeownership unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility.

      (3) The Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA shall report conversions on the Formula Response Form.

      § 1000.317   Who is the recipient for funds for current assisted stock which is owned by state-created Regional Native Housing Authorities in Alaska?

#### § § 1000.317

      If housing units developed under the 1937 Act are owned by a state-created Regional Native Housing Authority in Alaska, and are not located on an Indian reservation, then the recipient for funds allocated for the current assisted stock portion of NAHASDA funds for the units is the regional Indian tribe.

      § 1000.318   When do units under Formula Current Assisted Stock cease to be counted or expire from the inventory used for the formula?

#### § § 1000.318

      (a) Mutual Help and Turnkey III units shall no longer be considered Formula Current Assisted Stock when the Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA no longer has the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit, whether such right is lost by conveyance, demolition, or otherwise, provided that:

      (1) Conveyance of each Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit occurs as soon as practicable after a unit becomes eligible for conveyance by the terms of the MHOA; and

      (2) The Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA actively enforce strict compliance by the homebuyer with the terms and conditions of the MHOA, including the requirements for full and timely payment.

      (b)(1) A Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit not conveyed after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance by the terms of the MHOA may continue to be considered Formula Current Assisted Stock only if a legal impediment prevented conveyance; the legal impediment continues to exist; the tribe, TDHE, or IHA has taken all other steps necessary for conveyance and all that remains for conveyance is a resolution of the legal impediment; and the tribe, TDHE, or IHA made the following reasonable efforts to overcome the impediments:

      (i) No later than four months after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance, the tribe, TDHE, or IHA creates a written plan of action, which includes a description of specific legal impediments as well as specific, ongoing, and appropriate actions for each applicable unit that have been taken and will be taken to resolve the legal impediments within a 24-month period; and

      (ii) The tribe, TDHE, or IHA has carried out or is carrying out the written plan of action; and

      (iii) The tribe, TDHE, or IHA has documented undertaking the plan of action.

      (2) No Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit will be considered FCAS 24 months after the date the unit became eligible for conveyance, unless the tribe, TDHE, or IHA provides evidence from a third party, such as a court or state or federal government agency, documenting that a legal impediment continues to prevent conveyance. FCAS units that have not been conveyed due to legal impediments on December 22, 2016 shall be treated as having become eligible for conveyance on December 22, 2016.

      (c) Rental units shall continue to be included for formula purposes as long as they continue to be operated as low income rental units by the Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA.

      (d) Expired contract Section 8 units shall continue as rental units and be included in the formula as long as they are operated as low income rental units as included in the Indian tribe's or TDHE's Formula Response Form.

      (e) A unit that is demolished pursuant to a planned demolition may be considered eligible as a FCAS unit if, after demolition is completed, the unit is rebuilt within one year. Demolition is completed when the site of the demolished unit is ready for rebuilding. If the unit cannot be rebuilt within one year because of relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity, the Indian tribe, TDHE or IHA may request approval for a one-time, one-year extension. Requests must be submitted in writing and include a justification for the request.

      § 1000.319   What would happen if a recipient misreports or fails to correct Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) information on the Formula Response Form?

#### § § 1000.319

      (a) A recipient is responsible for verifying and reporting changes to their Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) on the Formula Response Form to ensure that data used for the IHBG Formula are accurate (see § 1000.315). Reporting shall be completed in accordance with requirements in this Subpart D and the Formula Response Form.

      (b) If a recipient receives an overpayment of funds because it failed to report such changes on the Formula Response Form in a timely manner, the recipient shall be required to repay the funds within 5 fiscal years. HUD shall subsequently distribute the funds to all Indian tribes in accordance with the next IHBG Formula allocation.

      (c) A recipient will not be provided back funding for any units that the recipient failed to report on the Formula Response Form in a timely manner.

      (d) HUD shall have 3 years from the date a Formula Response Form is sent out to take action against any recipient that fails to correct or make appropriate changes on that Formula Response Form. Review of FCAS will be accomplished by HUD as a component of A-133 audits, routine monitoring, FCAS target monitoring, or other reviews.

      § 1000.320   How is Formula Current Assisted Stock adjusted for local area costs?

#### § § 1000.320

      There are two adjustment factors that are used to adjust the allocation of funds for the Current Assisted Stock portion of the formula. They are:

      (a) Operating Subsidy as adjusted by the greater of the AEL factor or FMR factor (AELFMR); and

      (b) Modernization as adjusted by TDC.

      § 1000.322   Are IHA financed units included in the determination of Formula Current Assisted Stock?

#### § § 1000.322

      No. If these units are not owned or operated at the time (September 30, 1997) pursuant to an ACC then they are not included in the determination of Formula Current Assisted Stock.

      § 1000.324   How is the need component developed?

#### § § 1000.324

      After determining the FCAS allocation, remaining funds are allocated by need component. The need component consists of seven criteria. They are:

      (a) American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) Households with housing cost burden greater than 50 percent of formula annual income weighted at 22 percent;

      (b) AIAN Households which are overcrowded or without kitchen or plumbing weighted at 25 percent;

      (c) Housing Shortage which is the number of AIAN households with an annual income less than or equal to 80 percent of formula median income reduced by the combination of current assisted stock and units developed under NAHASDA weighted at 15 percent;

      (d) AIAN households with annual income less than or equal to 30 percent of formula median income weighted at 13 percent;

      (e) AIAN households with annual income between 30 percent and 50 percent of formula median income weighted at 7 percent;

      (f) AIAN households with annual income between 50 percent and 80 percent of formula median income weighted at 7 percent;

      (g) AIAN persons weighted at 11 percent.

      § 1000.325   How is the need component adjusted for local area costs?

#### § § 1000.325

      The need component is adjusted by the TDC.

      § 1000.326   What if a formula area is served by more than one Indian tribe?

#### § § 1000.326

      (a) If an Indian tribe's formula area overlaps with the formula area of one or more other Indian tribes, the funds allocated to that Indian tribe for the geographic area in which the formula areas overlap will be divided based on:

      (1) The Indian tribe's proportional share of the population in the overlapping geographic area; and

      (2) The Indian tribe's commitment to serve that proportional share of the population in such geographic area.

      (3) In cases where a State recognized tribe's formula area overlaps with the formula area of a Federally recognized Indian tribe, the Federally recognized Indian tribe receives the allocation for the formula area up to its population cap, and the State recognized tribe receives the balance of the overlapping area (if any) up to its population cap.

      (b) Tribal membership in the geographic area (not to include dually enrolled tribal members) will be based on data that all Indian tribes involved agree to use. Suggested data sources include tribal enrollment lists, the U.S. Census, Indian Health Service User Data, and Bureau of Indian Affairs data.

      (c) Upon receiving a request for expansion or redefinition of a tribe's formula area, if approving the request would create an overlap, HUD shall follow the notice and comment procedures set forth in paragraph (2)(ii) of the definition of “Formula area” in § 1000.302.

      (d) If the Indian tribes involved cannot agree on what data source to use, HUD will make the decision on what data will be used to divide the funds between the Indian tribes by August 1.

      § 1000.327   What is the order of preference for allocating the IHBG formula needs data for Indian tribes in Alaska not located on reservations due to the unique circumstances in Alaska?

#### § § 1000.327

      (a) Data in areas without reservations. The data on population and housing within an Alaska Native Village is credited to the Alaska Native Village. Accordingly, the village corporation for the Alaska Native Village has no needs data and no formula allocation. The data on population and housing outside the Alaska Native Village is credited to the regional Indian tribe, and if there is no regional Indian tribe, the data will be credited to the regional corporation.

      (b) Deadline for notification on whether an IHP will be submitted. By September 15 of each year, each Indian tribe in Alaska not located on a reservation, including each Alaska Native village, regional Indian tribe, and regional corporation, or its TDHE must notify HUD in writing whether it or its TDHE intends to submit an IHP. If an Alaska Native village notifies HUD that it does not intend either to submit an IHP or to designate a TDHE to do so, or if HUD receives no response from the Alaska Native village or its TDHE, the formula data which would have been credited to the Alaska Native village will be credited to the regional Indian tribe, or if there is no regional Indian tribe, to the regional corporation.

      § 1000.328   What is the minimum amount that an Indian tribe may receive under the need component of the formula?

#### § § 1000.328

      (a) Subject to the eligibility criteria described in paragraph (b) of this section, the minimum allocation in any fiscal year to an Indian tribe under the need component of the IHBG Formula shall equal 0.007826 percent of the available appropriations for that fiscal year after set asides.

      (b) To be eligible for the minimum allocation described in paragraph (a) of this section, an Indian tribe must:

      (1) Receive less than $200,000 under the FCAS component of the IHBG Formula for the fiscal year; and

      (2) Certify in its Indian Housing Plan the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income.

      § 1000.329   What is the minimum total grant allocated to a tribe if there is carryover funds available?

#### § § 1000.329

      (a) If in any given year there are carryover funds, then HUD will hold the lesser amount of $3 million or available carryover funds for additional allocations to tribes with grant allocations of less than 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations. All tribes eligible under this section shall receive a grant allocation equal to 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations.

      (b)(1) If the set-aside carryover funds are insufficient to fund all eligible tribes at 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations, the minimum total grant shall be reduced to an amount which can be fully funded with the available set-aside carryover funds.

      (2) If less than $3 million is necessary to fully fund tribes under paragraph (a) of this section, any remaining carryover amounts of the set aside shall be carried forward to the next year's formula.

      (c) To be eligible, an Indian tribe must certify in its Indian Housing Plan the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income.

      (d) For purposes of this section, carryover funds means grant funds voluntarily returned to the formula or not accepted by tribes in a fiscal year.

      § 1000.330   What are the data sources for the need variables?

#### § § 1000.330

      (a) The sources of data for the need variables shall be data that are available and collected in a uniform manner that can be confirmed and verified for all AIAN households and persons living in an identified area. Until fiscal year 2018, the data used are 2000 U.S. Decennial Census data and any HUD-accepted Census challenges. The 2000 U.S. Decennial Census data shall be adjusted annually using IHS projections based upon birth and death rate data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics.

      (b)(1) Beginning fiscal year 2018, the data source used to determine the AIAN persons variable described in § 1000.324(g) shall be the most recent U.S. Decennial Census data adjusted for any statistically significant undercount for AIAN population confirmed by the U.S. Census Bureau and updated annually using the U.S. Census Bureau county level Population Estimates for Native Americans. For Remote Alaska as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, Alaska Formula Areas in Remote Alaska shall be treated as Reservation and Trust Lands, unless the U.S. Census Bureau includes Remote Alaska in their Census Coverage Measurement or comparable study. The data under this paragraph (b) shall be updated annually using the U.S. Census Bureau county level Population Estimates for Native Americans.

      (2) Beginning fiscal year 2018, the data source used to determine the variables described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of § 1000.324 shall initially be the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates.

      (c) Indian tribes may challenge the data described in this section pursuant to § 1000.336.

      § 1000.331   How will the impacts from adoption of a new data source be minimized as the new data source is implemented?

#### § § 1000.331

      (a) To minimize the impact of funding changes based on the introduction of a new data source under § 1000.330, in fiscal year 2018 and each year thereafter, if, solely as a direct result of the introduction of a new data source, an Indian tribe's allocation under the need component of the formula is less than 90 percent of the amount it received under the need component in the immediate previous fiscal year, the Indian tribe's need allocation shall be adjusted up to an amount equal to 90 percent of the previous year's need allocation.

      (b) Nothing in this section shall impact other adjustments under this part, including minimum funding, census challenges, formula area changes, or an increase in the total amount of funds available under the need component.

      (c) In the event of a decrease in the total amount of funds available under the need component, an Indian tribe's adjusted allocation under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the reduced amount available for distribution under the need component of the formula.

      (d) Adjustments under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made to a tribe's need allocation after adjusting that allocation under paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 1000.336   How may an Indian tribe, TDHE, or HUD challenge data or appeal HUD formula determinations?

#### § § 1000.336

      (a) An Indian tribe, TDHE, or HUD may challenge data used in the IHBG Formula and HUD formula determinations regarding:

      (1) U.S. Census data;

      (2) Tribal enrollment;

      (3) Formula area;

      (4) Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS);

      (5) Total Development Cost (TDC);

      (6) Fair Market Rents (FMRs);

      (7) Indian Health Service projections based upon birth and death rate data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics; and

      (8) The undisbursed funds factor.

      (b) An Indian tribe or TDHE may not challenge data or HUD formula determinations regarding Allowable Expense Level (AEL) and the inflation factor.

      (c) The challenge and the collection of data and the appeal of HUD formula determinations is an allowable cost for IHBG funds.

      (d) An Indian tribe or TDHE that seeks to appeal data or a HUD formula determination, and has data in its possession that are acceptable to HUD, shall submit the challenge or appeal in writing with data and proper documentation to HUD. An Indian tribe or TDHE may appeal the undisbursed funds factor no later than 30 days after the receipt of the formula determination. Data used to challenge data contained in the U.S. Census must meet the requirements described in § 1000.330(a). Further, in order for a census challenge to be considered for the upcoming fiscal year allocation, documentation must be submitted by March 30th.

      (e) HUD shall respond to all challenges or appeals no later than 45 days after receipt and either approve or deny the appeal in writing, setting forth the reasons for its decision.

      (1) If HUD challenges the validity of the submitted data HUD and the Indian tribe or TDHE shall attempt in good faith to resolve any discrepancies so that such data may be included in the formula allocation.

      (2) If HUD denies a challenge or appeal, the Indian tribe or TDHE may request reconsideration of HUD's denial within 30 calendar days of receipt of HUD's denial. The request shall be in writing and set forth justification for reconsideration.

      (3) HUD shall in writing affirm or deny the Indian tribe's or TDHE's request for reconsideration, setting forth HUD's reasons for the decision, within 20 calendar days of receiving the request. HUD's denial of a request for reconsideration shall constitute final agency action.

      (4) If HUD approves the Indian tribe or TDHE's appeal, HUD will adjust to the Indian tribe's or TDHE's subsequent fiscal year allocation to include only the disputed fiscal year(s).

      (f) In the event HUD questions whether the data contained in the formula accurately represents the Indian tribe's need, HUD shall request the Indian tribe to submit supporting documentation to justify the data and, if applicable, to provide a commitment to serve the population indicated in the geographic area.

#### § § 1000.340

      (a) If an Indian tribe is allocated less funding under the modernization allocation of the formula pursuant to § 1000.316(b)(2) than the calculation of the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per-unit amount of allocation for FY 1996 modernization multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation, the Indian tribe's modernization allocation is calculated under § 1000.316(b)(1). The remaining grants are adjusted to keep the allocation within available appropriations.

      (b) If an Indian tribe is allocated less funding under the formula than an IHA received on its behalf in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization, its grant is increased to the amount received in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization. The remaining grants are adjusted to keep the allocation within available appropriations.

      § 1000.342   Are undisbursed IHBG funds a factor in the grant formula?

#### § § 1000.342

      Yes, beginning fiscal year 2018. After calculating the initial allocation calculation for the current fiscal year by calculating FCAS, need, the 1996 Minimum, and repayments or additions for past over- or under-funding for each Indian tribe, the undisbursed funds factor shall be applied as follows:

      (a) The undisbursed funds factor applies if an Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more and the Indian tribe has undisbursed IHBG funds in an amount that is greater than the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations.

      (b) If subject to paragraph (a) of this section, the Indian tribe's grant allocation shall be the greater of the initial allocation calculation minus the amount of undisbursed IHBG funds that exceed the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations, or its 1996 Minimum.

      (c) For purposes of this section, “undisbursed IHBG funds” means the amount of IHBG funds allocated to an Indian tribe in HUD's line of credit control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made. For Indian tribes under an umbrella TDHE (a recipient that has been designated to receive grant amounts by more than one Indian tribe), if the Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more, its undisbursed IHBG funds is the amount calculated by multiplying the umbrella TDHE's total balance in HUD's line of credit control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made by a percentage based on the Indian tribe's proportional share of the initial allocation calculation of all tribes under the umbrella.

      (d) Amounts subtracted from an initial allocation calculation under this section shall be redistributed under the need component among all Indian tribes not subject to paragraph (a) of this section (while also retaining the 1996 Minimum).

      (b) If monitoring indicates noncompliance, HUD may undertake additional sampling and review to determine the extent of such noncompliance. The level of HUD monitoring of a recipient once that recipient has been selected for HUD monitoring is as follows:

      (1) Review recipient program compliance for the current program year and the 2 prior program years;

      (2) On-site inspection of no more than 10 dwelling units or no more than 10 percent of total dwelling units, whichever is greater;

      (3) Review of no more than 10 client files or no more than 10 percent of client files, whichever is greater.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, HUD may at any time undertake additional sampling and review of prior program years, subject to the records retention limitations of § 1000.552, if HUD has credible information suggesting noncompliance. HUD will share this information with the recipient as appropriate.

      (d) A recipient may request ONAP to enter into Self-Monitoring Mutual Agreements or other self-monitoring arrangements with recipients. ONAP will monitor the recipient only in accordance with such agreement or arrangement, unless ONAP finds reasonable evidence of fraud, a pattern of noncompliance, or the significant unlawful expenditure of IHBG funds.

      (4) In the case of noncompliance described in § 1000.542, provide a replacement TDHE for the recipient.

      (b) Before undertaking any action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient in writing of the action it intends to take and provide the recipient an opportunity for an informal meeting to resolve the deficiency. Before taking any action under paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall provide the recipient with the opportunity for a hearing no less than 30 days prior to taking the proposed action. The hearing shall be held in accordance with § 1000.540. The amount in question shall not be reallocated under the provisions of § 1000.536, until 15 days after the hearing has been conducted and HUD has rendered a final decision.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if HUD makes a determination that the failure of a recipient to comply substantially with any material provision of NAHASDA or these regulations is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of funds provided under NAHASDA in a manner that is not authorized by law, HUD may, in accordance with section 401(a)(4) of NAHASDA, take action under paragraph (a)(3) of this section prior to conducting a hearing under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if HUD determines that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient, if the recipient requests, HUD shall provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability or capacity of the recipient to administer assistance under NAHASDA in compliance with the requirements under NAHASDA. A recipient's eligibility for technical assistance under this subsection is contingent on the recipient's execution of, and compliance with, a performance agreement pursuant to Section 401(b) of NAHASDA.

      (e) In lieu of, or in addition to, any action described in this section, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations, HUD may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, with a recommendation that appropriate civil action be instituted.

This review is a two step process. First, there must be a noncompliance with NAHASDA or these regulations. Second, the noncompliance must be substantial. A noncompliance is substantial if:

      (a) The noncompliance has a material effect on the recipient meeting its planned activities as described in its Indian Housing Plan;

      (b) The noncompliance represents a material pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance with a particular provision of NAHASDA or the regulations, even if a single instance of noncompliance would not be substantial;

      (c) The noncompliance involves the obligation or expenditure of a material amount of the NAHASDA funds budgeted by the recipient for a material activity; or

      (d) The noncompliance places the housing program at substantial risk of fraud, waste or abuse.

      § 1000.536   What happens to NAHASDA grant funds adjusted, reduced, withdrawn, or terminated under § 1000.532?

#### § § 1000.536

      Such NAHASDA grant funds shall be distributed by HUD in accordance with the next NAHASDA formula allocation.

      § 1000.540   What hearing procedures will be used under NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.540

      The hearing procedures in 24 CFR part 26 shall be used.

      § 1000.542   When may HUD require replacement of a recipient?

#### § § 1000.542

      (a) In accordance with section 402 of NAHASDA, as a condition of HUD making a grant on behalf of an Indian tribe, the Indian tribe shall agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, HUD may, only in the circumstances discussed below, require that a replacement TDHE serve as the recipient for the Indian tribe.

      (b) HUD may require a replacement TDHE for an Indian tribe only upon a determination by HUD on the record after opportunity for hearing that the recipient for the Indian tribe has engaged in a pattern or practice of activities that constitute substantial or willful noncompliance with the requirements of NAHASDA.

      § 1000.544   What audits are required?

#### § § 1000.544

      Pursuant to NAHASDA section 405(a), the recipient must comply with the requirements of the Single Audit Act (chapter 75 of title 31, United States Code), implemented by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, which require annual audits of recipients that expend federal funds equal to or in excess of an amount specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as set out in 2 CFR 200.501. If applicable, a certification that the recipient has not expended federal funds in excess of the audit threshold that is set by OMB shall be included in the recipient's Annual Performance Report.

      § 1000.546   Are audit costs eligible program or administrative expenses?

#### § § 1000.546

      Yes, audit costs are an eligible program or administrative expense. If the Indian tribe is the recipient then program funds can be used to pay a prorated share of the tribal audit or financial review cost that is attributable to NAHASDA funded activities. For a recipient not covered by the Single Audit Act, but which chooses to obtain a periodic financial review, the cost of such a review would be an eligible program expense.

      § 1000.548   Must a copy of the recipient's audit pursuant to the Single Audit Act relating to NAHASDA activities be submitted to HUD?

#### § § 1000.548

      No. A copy of the recipient audit under the Single Audit Act relating to NAHASDA activities is only required to be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

> [80 FR 75944, Dec. 7, 2015]

      § 1000.550   If the TDHE is the recipient, does it have to submit a copy of its audit to the Indian tribe?

#### § § 1000.550

      Yes. The Indian tribe as the grant beneficiary must receive a copy of the audit report so that it can fully carry out its oversight responsibilities with NAHASDA.

      § 1000.552   How long must the recipient maintain program records?

#### § § 1000.552

      (a) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, and statistical records of the recipient which are required to be maintained by the statute, regulation, or grant agreement.

      (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, records must be retained for 3 years from the end of the tribal program year during which the funds were expended.

      (c) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.

      § 1000.554   Which agencies have right of access to the recipient's records relating to activities carried out under NAHASDA?

#### § § 1000.554

      (a) HUD and the Comptroller General of the United States, and any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients which are pertinent to NAHASDA assistance, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

      (b) The right of access in this section lasts as long as the records are maintained.

      § 1000.556   Does the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) apply to recipient records?

#### § § 1000.556

      FOIA does not apply to recipient records. However, there may be other applicable State and tribal access laws or recipient policies which may apply.

      § 1000.558   Does the Federal Privacy Act apply to recipient records?

#### § § 1000.558

      The Federal Privacy Act does not apply to recipient records. However, there may be other applicable State and tribal access laws or recipient policies which may apply.

#### § § 1003.1

      The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible applicants under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska native villages.

      § 1003.2   Program objective.

#### § § 1003.2

      The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee covered under the Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaska native communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of tribal financial support for community development activities below the level of such support before the availability of this assistance.

      § 1003.3   Nature of program.

#### § § 1003.3

      The selection of single purpose grantees under subpart B of this part is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of grantees for funds will reflect consideration of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing tribally determined need. The selection of grantees of imminent threat grants under the provisions of subpart B of this part is not competitive in nature. However, applicants for funding under either subpart must have the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.

      § 1003.4   Definitions.

#### § § 1003.5

      (a) Eligible applicants are any Indian tribe, band, group, or nation, including Alaska Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos, and any Alaska native village of the United States which is considered an eligible recipient under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450) or which had been an eligible recipient under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (31 U.S.C. 1221).

      (b) Tribal organizations which are eligible under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act may apply on behalf of any Indian tribe, band, group, nation, or Alaska native village eligible under that act for funds under this part when one or more of these entities have authorized the tribal organization to do so through concurring resolutions. Such resolutions must accompany the application for funding. Eligible tribal organizations under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act will be determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health Service, as appropriate.

      (c) To apply for funding in a given fiscal year, an applicant must be eligible as an Indian tribe or Alaska native village, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, or as a Tribal organization, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, by the application submission date.

      § 1003.6   Waivers.

#### § § 1003.6

      Upon determination of good cause, HUD may waive any provision of this part not required by statute. Each waiver must be in writing and must be supported by documentation of the pertinent facts and grounds.

    Subpart B—Allocation of Funds

      § 1003.100   General.

#### § § 1003.100

      (a)  Two types of grants are available under the Indian CDBG Program.

      (1)  provide funds for one or more single purpose projects consisting of an activity or set of activities designed to meet a specific community development need. This type of grant is awarded through competition with other single purpose projects.

      (2)  alleviate an imminent threat to public health or safety that requires immediate resolution. This type of grant is awarded only after an Area ONAP determines that such conditions exist and if funds are available for such grants.

      (b) —(1)  Each Area ONAP may recommend grant ceilings for single purpose grant applications. Single purpose grant ceilings for each Area ONAP shall be established in the NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability).

      (2)  An Area ONAP may approve a grant amount less than the amount requested. In doing so, the Area ONAP may take into account the size of the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives, the reasonableness of the project costs, and the administrative capacity of the applicant to complete the activities in a timely manner.

> [61 FR 40090, July 31, 1996. Redesignated at 62 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 4580, Jan. 17, 2001; 66 FR 8176, Jan. 30, 2001]

      § 1003.101   Area ONAP allocation of funds.

#### § § 1003.101

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the Area ONAPs responsible for the program on the following basis:

      (1) Each Area ONAP will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance of the ICDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

      (2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated and any amount retained by the Headquarters ONAP to fund imminent threat grants pursuant to the provisions of § 1003.402 is subtracted, will be allocated to each Area ONAP based on the most recent data complied and published by the United States Bureau of the Census referable to the same point or period in time, as follows:

      (i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total eligible Indian population;

      (ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of poverty among the eligible Indian population; and

      (iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population.

      (b) HUD will use other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing funds to the Area ONAPs if funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year if it is determined that the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to accomplish the purpose. HUD will use other criteria if it is determined that, based on a limited appropriation of funds, the use of the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to obtain an equitable allocation of funds.

      (c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those tribes and villages that are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year.

      § 1003.102   Use of recaptured and unawarded funds.

#### § § 1003.102

      (a) The Assistant Secretary will determine on a case-by-case basis the use of grant funds which are:

      (1) Recaptured by HUD under the provisions of § 1003.703 or § 1003.704;

      (2) Recaptured by HUD at the time of the closeout of a program; or

      (3) Unawarded after the completion by an Area ONAP of a funding competition.

      (b) The recaptured or unawarded funds will remain with the Area ONAP to which they were originally allocated unless the Assistant Secretary determines that there is an overriding reason to redistribute these funds outside of the Area ONAP's jurisdiction. The recaptured funds may be used to fund the highest ranking unfunded project from the most recent funding competition, an imminent threat, or other uses. Unawarded funds may be used to fund an imminent threat or other uses.

    Subpart C—Eligible Activities

      § 1003.200   General policies.

#### § § 1003.200

      An activity may be assisted in whole or in part with ICDBG funds only if the activity meets the eligibility requirements of section 105 of the Act as further defined in this subpart and if the criteria for compliance with the primary objective of the Act set forth under § 1003.208 have been met. The requirements for compliance with the primary objective of the Act do not apply to imminent threat grants funded under subpart E of this part.

      § 1003.201   Basic eligible activities.

#### § § 1003.201

      ICDBG funds may be used for the following activities:

      (a)  Acquisition in whole or in part by the grantee, or other public or private nonprofit entity, by purchase, long-term lease, donation, or otherwise, of real property (including air rights, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other interests therein) for any public purpose, subject to the limitations of § 1003.207.

      (b)  Disposition, through sale, lease, donation, or otherwise, of any real property acquired with ICDBG funds or its retention for public purposes, including reasonable costs of temporarily managing such property or property acquired under urban renewal, provided that the proceeds from any such disposition shall be program income subject to the requirements set forth in § 1003.503.

      (c)  Acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or installation of public facilities and improvements, except as provided in § 1003.207(a), carried out by the grantee or other public or private nonprofit entities. In undertaking such activities, design features and improvements which promote energy efficiency may be included. [However, activities under this paragraph may be directed to the removal of material and architectural barriers that restrict the mobility and accessibility of elderly or severely disabled persons to publicly owned and privately owned buildings, facilities, and improvements including those provided for in § 1003.207(a)(1).] Such activities may also include the execution of architectural design features, and similar treatments intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of facilities and improvements receiving ICDBG assistance. Facilities designed for use in providing shelter for persons having special needs are considered public facilities and not subject to the prohibition of new housing construction described in § 1003.207(b)(3). Such facilities include shelters for the homeless; convalescent homes; hospitals, nursing homes; battered spouse shelters; halfway houses for run-away children, drug offenders or parolees; group homes for mentally retarded persons and temporary housing for disaster victims. In certain cases, nonprofit entities and subrecipients including those specified in § 1003.204 may acquire title to public facilities. When such facilities are owned by nonprofit entities or subrecipients, they shall be operated so as to be open for use by the general public during all normal hours of operation. Public facilities and improvements eligible for assistance under this paragraph (c) are subject to the following policies in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section:

      (1)  The following special policies apply to:

      (i)  A public facility otherwise eligible for assistance under the ICDBG program may be provided with ICDBG funds even if it is part of a multiple use building containing ineligible uses, if:

      (A) The facility which is otherwise eligible and proposed for assistance will occupy a designated and discrete area within the larger facility; and

      (B) The grantee can determine the costs attributable to the facility proposed for assistance as separate and distinct from the overall costs of the multiple-use building and/or facility. Allowable costs are limited to those attributable to the eligible portion of the building or facility.

      (ii)  As stated in § 1003.207(b)(1), the purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible. However, the purchase of construction equipment for use as part of a solid waste facility is eligible. In addition, the purchase of fire protection equipment is considered to be an integral part of a public facility, and, therefore, the purchase of such equipment is also eligible.

      (2)  Reasonable fees may be charged for the use of the facilities assisted with ICDBG funds, but charges such as excessive membership fees, which will have the effect of precluding low and moderate income persons from using the facilities, are not permitted.

      (3)  The following policies relate to special assessments under the ICDBG program:

      (i)  The term  means the recovery of the capital costs of a public improvement, such as streets, water or sewer lines, curbs, and gutters, through a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement, or a one-time charge made as a condition of access to a public improvement. This term does not relate to taxes, or the establishment of the value of real estate for the purpose of levying real estate, property, or ad valorem taxes, and does not include periodic charges based on the use of a public improvement, such as water or sewer user charges, even if such charges include the recovery of all or some portion of the capital costs of the public improvement.

      (ii)  Where ICDBG funds are used to pay all or part of the cost of a public improvement, special assessments may be imposed as follows:

      (A) Special assessments to recover the ICDBG funds may be made only against properties owned and occupied by persons not of low and moderate income. Such assessments constitute program income.

      (B) Special assessments to recover the non-ICDBG portion may be made provided that ICDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment on behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income persons; except that ICDBG funds need not be used to pay the special assessments on behalf of properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons if the grantee certifies that it does not have sufficient ICDBG funds to pay the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner-occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are not program income.

      (iii)  The payment of special assessments with ICDBG funds constitutes ICDBG assistance to the public improvement. Therefore, ICDBG funds may be used to pay special assessments provided:

      (A) The installation of the public improvements was carried out in compliance with requirements applicable to activities assisted under this part including environmental and citizen participation requirements; and

      (B) The installation of the public improvement meets a criterion for the primary objective in § 1003.208; and,

      (C) The requirements of § 1003.201(c)(3)(ii))(B) are met.

      (d)  Clearance, demolition, and removal of buildings and improvements, including movement of structures to other sites. Demolition of HUD-assisted housing units may be undertaken only with the prior approval of HUD.

      (e)  Provision of public services (including labor, supplies, materials, and the purchase of personal property and furnishings) which are directed toward improving the community's public services and facilities, including but not limited to those concerned with employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug abuse, education, fair housing counseling, energy conservation, welfare (but excluding the provision of income payments identified under § 1003.207(b)(4)), homebuyer downpayment assistance or recreational needs. To be eligible for ICDBG assistance, a public service must be either a new service, or a quantifiable increase in the level of an existing service above that which has been provided by or on behalf of the grantee through funds raised by the grantee, or received by the grantee from the Federal government in the twelve calendar months before the submission of the application for ICDBG assistance. (An exception to this requirement may be made if HUD determines that any decrease in the level of a service was the result of events not within the control of the grantee.) The amount of ICDBG funds used for public services shall not exceed 15 percent of the grant. Such projects must therefore be submitted with one or more other projects, which must comprise at least 85 percent of the total requested ICDBG grant amount.

      (f)  (1) The following activities may be undertaken on an interim basis in areas exhibiting objectively determinable signs of physical deterioration where the grantee has determined that immediate action is necessary to arrest the deterioration and that permanent improvements will be carried out as soon as practicable:

      (i) The repairing of streets, sidewalks, parks, playgrounds, publicly owned utilities, and public buildings; and

      (ii) The execution of special garbage, trash, and debris removal, including neighborhood cleanup campaigns, but not the regular curbside collection of garbage or trash in an area.

      (2) In order to alleviate emergency conditions threatening the public health and safety in areas where the chief executive officer of the grantee determines that such an emergency condition exists and requires immediate resolution, ICDBG funds may be used for:

      (i) The activities specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, except for the repair of parks and playgrounds;

      (ii) The clearance of streets, including snow removal and similar activities; and

      (iii) The improvement of private properties.

      (3) All activities authorized under paragraph (f)(2) of this section are limited to the extent necessary to alleviate emergency conditions.

      (g)  Payment of the non-Federal share required in connection with a Federal grant-in-aid program undertaken as part of ICDBG activities, provided, that such payment shall be limited to activities otherwise eligible and in compliance with applicable requirements under this subpart.

      (h)  Relocation payments and other assistance for permanently and temporarily relocated individuals families, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farm operations where the assistance is:

      (1) Required under the provisions of § 1003.602 (b) or (c); or

      (2) Determined by the grantee to be appropriate under the provisions of § 1003.602(d).

      (i)  Payments to housing owners for losses of rental income incurred in holding, for temporary periods, housing units to be used for the relocation of individuals and families displaced by program activities assisted under this part.

      (j)  Housing services, as provided in section 105(a)(21) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5305(a)(21)].

      (k)  ICDBG funds may be used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, or install the distribution lines and facilities of privately owned utilities, including the placing underground of new or existing distribution facilities and lines.

      (l)  (1) The provision of assistance either through the grantee directly or through public and private organizations, agencies, and other subrecipients (including nonprofit and for-profit subrecipients) to facilitate economic development by:

      (i) Providing credit, including, but not limited to, grants, loans, loan guarantees, and other forms of financial support, for the establishment, stabilization, and expansion of microenterprises;

      (ii) Providing technical assistance, advice, and business support services to owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises; and

      (iii) Providing general support, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, to owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises.

      (2) Services provided under paragraph (l)(1) of this section shall not be subject to the restrictions on public services contained in § 1003.201(e).

      (3) For purposes of this paragraph (l),  means such persons who have expressed interest and who are, or after an initial screening process are expected to be, actively working toward developing businesses, each of which is expected to be a microenterprise at the time it is formed.

      (m)  Provision of technical assistance to public or nonprofit entities to increase the capacity of such entities to carry out eligible neighborhood revitalization or economic development activities.

      (a) Types of buildings and improvements eligible for rehabilitation or reconstruction assistance. ICDBG funds may be used to finance the rehabilitation of:

      (1) Privately owned buildings and improvements for residential purposes; improvements to a single-family residential property which is also used as a place of business, which are required in order to operate the business, need not be considered to be rehabilitation of a commercial or industrial building, if the improvements also provide general benefit to the residential occupants of the building;

      (2) Low-income public housing and other publicly owned residential buildings and improvements;

      (3) Publicly or privately owned commercial or industrial buildings, except that the rehabilitation of such buildings owned by a private for-profit business is limited to improvements to the exterior of the building and the correction of code violations (further improvements to such buildings may be undertaken pursuant to § 1003.203(b)); and

      (4) Nonprofit-owned nonresidential buildings and improvements not eligible under § 1003.201(c);

      (5) Manufactured housing when such housing constitutes part of the community's permanent housing stock.

      (1) Assistance to private individuals and entities, including profit making and nonprofit organizations, to acquire for the purpose of rehabilitation, and to rehabilitate properties, for use or resale for residential purposes;

      (2) Labor, materials, and other costs of rehabilitation of properties, including repair directed toward an accumulation of deferred maintenance, replacement of principal fixtures and components of existing structures, installation of security devices, including smoke detectors and dead bolt locks, and renovation through alterations, additions to, or enhancement of existing structures, which may be undertaken singly, or in combination;

      (3) Loans for refinancing existing indebtedness secured by a property being rehabilitated with ICDBG funds if such financing is determined by the grantee to be necessary or appropriate to achieve the grantee's community development objectives;

      (4) Improvements to increase the efficient use of energy in structures through such means as installation of storm windows and doors, siding, wall and attic insulation, and conversion, modification, or replacement of heating and cooling equipment, including the use of solar energy equipment;

      (5) Improvements to increase the efficient use of water through such means as water saving faucets and shower heads and repair of water leaks;

      (6) Connection of residential structures to water distribution lines or local sewer collection lines;

      (7) For rehabilitation carried out with ICDBG funds, costs of:

      (i) Initial homeowner warranty premiums;

      (ii) Hazard insurance premiums, except where assistance is provided in the form of a grant; and

      (iii) Flood insurance premiums for properties covered by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, pursuant to 24 CFR 58.6(a).

      (c)  Code enforcement in deteriorating or deteriorated areas where such enforcement together with public or private improvements, rehabilitation, or services to be provided, may be expected to arrest the decline of the area.

      (d)  ICDBG funds may be used for the rehabilitation, preservation or restoration of historic properties, whether publicly or privately owned. Historic properties are those sites or structures that are either listed in or eligible to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, listed in a State or local inventory of historic places, or designated as a State or local landmark or historic district by appropriate law or ordinance. Historic preservation, however, is not authorized for buildings for the general conduct of government.

      (e)  ICDBG funds may be used to renovate closed buildings, such as closed school buildings, for use as an eligible public facility or to rehabilitate such buildings for housing.

      § 1003.203   Special economic development activities.

#### § § 1003.203

      A grantee may use ICDBG funds for special economic development activities in addition to other activities authorized in this subpart which may be carried out as part of an economic development project. Special activities authorized under this section do not include assistance for the construction of new housing. Special economic development activities include:

      (a) The acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or installation of commercial or industrial buildings, structures, and other real property equipment and improvements, including railroad spurs or similar extensions. Such activities may be carried out by the grantee or public or private nonprofit subrecipients.

      (b) The provision of assistance to a private for-profit business, including, but not limited to, grants, loans, loan guarantees, interest supplements, technical assistance, and other forms of support, for any activity where the assistance is necessary or appropriate to carry out an economic development project, excluding those described as ineligible in § 1003.207(a). In order to ensure that any such assistance does not unduly enrich the for-profit business, the grantee shall conduct an analysis to determine that the amount of any financial assistance to be provided is not excessive, taking into account the actual needs of the business in making the project financially feasible and the extent of public benefit expected to be derived from the economic development project. The grantee shall document the analysis as well as any factors it considered in making its determination that the assistance is necessary or appropriate to carry out the project. The requirement for making such a determination applies whether the business is to receive assistance from the grantee or through a subrecipient.

      § 1003.204   Special activities by Community-Based Development Organizations (CBDOs).

#### § § 1003.204

      (a)  The grantee may provide ICDBG funds as grants or loans to any CBDO qualified under this section to carry out a neighborhood revitalization, community economic development, or energy conservation project. The funded project activities may include those listed as eligible under this subpart, and, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section, activities not otherwise listed as eligible under this subpart. For purposes of qualifying as a project under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section, the funded activity or activities may be considered either alone or in concert with other project activities either being carried out or for which funding has been committed. For purposes of this section:

      (1) Neighborhood revitalization project includes activities of sufficient size and scope to have an impact on the decline of a geographic location within the jurisdiction of a grantee (but not the entire jurisdiction) designated in comprehensive plans, ordinances, or other local documents as a neighborhood, village, or similar geographical designation; or the entire jurisdiction of a grantee which is under 25,000 population;

      (2) Community economic development project includes activities that increase economic opportunity, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income, or that stimulate or retain businesses or permanent jobs, including projects that include one or more such activities that are clearly needed to address a lack of affordable housing accessible to existing or planned jobs;

      (3) Energy conservation project includes activities that address energy conservation, principally for the benefit of the residents of the grantee's jurisdiction; and

      (4) To carry out a project means that the CBDO undertakes the funded activities directly or through contract with an entity other than the grantee, or through the provision of financial assistance for activities in which it retains a direct and controlling involvement and responsibilities.

      (b)  Notwithstanding that CBDOs may carry out activities that are not otherwise eligible under this subpart, this section does not authorize:

      (1) Carrying out an activity described as ineligible in § 1003.207(a);

      (2) Carrying out public services that do not meet the requirements of § 1003.201(e), except services carried out under this section that are specifically designed to increase economic opportunities through job training and placement and other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services;

      (3) Carrying out an activity that would otherwise be eligible under § 1003.205 or § 1003.206, but that would result in the grantee's exceeding the spending limitation in § 1003.206.

      (c)  (1) A CBDO qualifying under this section is an organization which has the following characteristics:

      (i) Is an association or corporation organized under State or local law to engage in community development activities (which may include housing and economic development activities) primarily within an identified geographic area of operation within the jurisdiction of the grantee; and

      (ii) Has as its primary purpose the improvement of the physical, economic or social environment of its geographic area of operation by addressing one or more critical problems of the area, with particular attention to the needs of persons of low and moderate income; and

      (iii) May be either non-profit or for-profit, provided any monetary profits to its shareholders or members must be only incidental to its operations; and

      (iv) Maintains at least 51 percent of its governing body's membership for low- and moderate-income residents of its geographic area of operation, owners or senior officers of private establishments and other institutions located in and serving its geographic area of operation, or representatives of low- and moderate-income neighborhood organizations located in its geographic area of operation; and

      (v) Is not an agency or instrumentality of the grantee and does not permit more than one-third of the membership of its governing body to be appointed by, or to consist of, elected or other public officials or employees or officials of an ineligible entity (even though such persons may be otherwise qualified under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section); and

      (vi) Except as otherwise authorized in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, requires the members of its governing body to be nominated and approved by the general membership of the organization, or by its permanent governing body; and

      (vii) Is not subject to requirements under which its assets revert to the grantee upon dissolution; and

      (viii) Is free to contract for goods and services from vendors of its own choosing.

      (2) A CBDO that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may also qualify as an eligible entity under this section if it meets one of the following requirements:

      (i) Is an entity organized pursuant to section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 681(d)), including those which are profit making; or

      (ii) Is an SBA-approved Section 501 State Development Company or Section 502 Local Development Company, or an SBA Certified Section 503 Company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended; or

      (iii) Is a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) under 24 CFR 92.2, designated as a CHDO by the HOME Investment Partnerships program participating jurisdiction, with a geographic area of operation of no more than one neighborhood, and has received HOME funds under 24 CFR 92.300 or is expected to receive HOME funds as described in and documented in accordance with 24 CFR 92.300(e); or

      (iv) Is a tribal-based nonprofit organization. Such organizations are associations or corporations duly organized to promote and undertake community development activities on a not-for-profit basis within an identified service area.

      (3) A CBDO that does not qualify under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section may also be determined to qualify as an eligible entity under this section if the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of HUD, through the provision of information regarding the organization's charter and by-laws, that the organization is sufficiently similar in purpose, function, and scope to those entities qualifying under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

      § 1003.205   Eligible planning, urban environmental design and policy-planning-management-capacity building activities.

#### § § 1003.205

      (a) Planning activities which consist of all costs of data gathering, studies, analysis, and preparation of plans and the identification of actions that will implement such plans, including, but not limited to comprehensive plans, community development plans and functional plans in areas such as housing and economic development. In addition, other plans and studies such as capital improvements programs, individual project plans, general environmental studies, and strategies and action programs to implement plans, including the development of codes and ordinances are also eligible activities. With respect to the costs of individual project plans, engineering and design costs related to a specific activity are eligible as part of the cost of such activity under §§ 1003.201 through 1003.204 and are not considered planning costs. Also, costs necessary to comply with the requirements of 24 CFR part 58, including project specific environmental assessments and clearances for activities eligible under this part are eligible as part of the cost of such activities under §§ 1003.201 through 1003.204.

      (b) Policy—planning—management—capacity building activities including those which will enable the grantee to determine its needs, set long term goals and short term objectives, devise programs to meet these goals and objectives, evaluate the progress being made in accomplishing the goals and objectives. In addition, actions necessary to carry out management, coordination and monitoring of activities necessary for effective planning implementation are eligible planning activities, however the costs necessary to implement the plans are not.

      § 1003.206   Program administration costs.

#### § § 1003.206

      ICDBG funds may be used for the payment of reasonable administrative costs and carrying charges related to the planning and execution of community development activities assisted in whole or in part with funds provided under this part. No more than 20 percent of the sum of any grant plus program income received shall be expended for activities described in this section and in § 1003.205—Eligible planning, urban environmental design and policy-planning-management capacity building activities. This does not include staff and overhead costs directly related to carrying out activities eligible under §§ 1003.201 through 1003.204, since those costs are eligible as part of such activities. In addition, technical assistance costs associated with developing the capacity to undertake a specific funded activity are also not considered program administration costs. These costs must not, however, exceed 10% of the total grant award.

      (a)  Reasonable costs of overall program management, coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. Such costs include, but are not necessarily limited to, necessary expenditures for the following:

      (1) Salaries, wages, and related costs of the grantee's staff, the staff of local public agencies, or other staff engaged in program administration. In charging costs to this category the grantee may either include the entire salary, wages, and related costs allocable to the program of each person whose primary responsibilities with regard to the program involve program administration assignments, or the pro rata share of the salary, wages, and related costs of each person whose job includes any program administration assignments. The grantee may use only one of these methods during the grant period. Program administration includes the following types of assignments:

      (i) Providing tribal officials and citizens with information about the program;

      (ii) Preparing program budgets and schedules, and amendments thereto;

      (iii) Developing systems for assuring compliance with program requirements;

      (iv) Developing interagency agreements and agreements with subrecipients and contractors to carry out program activities;

      (v) Monitoring program activities for progress and compliance with program requirements;

      (vi) Preparing reports and other documents related to the program for submission to HUD;

      (vii) Coordinating the resolution of audit and monitoring findings;

      (viii) Evaluating program results against stated objectives; and

      (ix) Managing or supervising persons whose primary responsibilities with regard to the program include such assignments as those described in paragraph (a)(1) (i) through (viii) of this section.

      (2) Travel costs incurred for official business in carrying out the program;

      (3) Administrative services performed under third party contracts or agreements, including such services as general legal services, accounting services, and audit services; and

      (4) Other costs for goods and services required for administration of the program, including such goods and services as rental or purchase of equipment, furnishings, or other personal property (or the payment of depreciation for such items in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E , insurance, utilities, office supplies, and rental and maintenance (but not purchase) of office space.)

      (b)  The provisions of information and other resources to residents and citizen organizations participating in the planning, implementation, or assessment of activities being assisted with ICDBG funds.

      (c)  Indirect costs may be charged to the ICDBG program under a cost allocation plan prepared in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.

      (d)  Preparation of documents required for submission to HUD to receive funds under the ICDBG program. In addition, ICDBG funds may be used to prepare applications for other Federal programs where the grantee determines that such activities are necessary or appropriate to achieve its community development objectives.

      § 1003.207   Ineligible activities.

#### § § 1003.207

      The general rule is that any activity that is not authorized under the provisions of §§ 1003.201 through 1003.206 is ineligible to be assisted with ICDBG funds. This section identifies specific activities that are ineligible and provides guidance in determining the eligibility of other activities frequently associated with housing and community development.

      (a) The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds:

      (1) Buildings or portions thereof used for the general conduct of government as defined at § 1003.4 cannot be assisted with ICDBG funds. This does not include, however, the removal of architectural barriers under § 1003.201(c) involving any such building. Also, where acquisition of real property includes an existing improvement which is to be used in the provision of a building for the general conduct of government, the portion of the acquisition cost attributable to the land is eligible, provided such acquisition meets the primary objective described in § 1003.208.

      (2)  Except as otherwise specifically authorized in this subpart or under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, expenses required to carry out the regular responsibilities of the grantee are not eligible for assistance under this part.

      (3)  ICDBG funds shall not be used to finance the use of facilities or equipment for political purposes or to engage in other partisan political activities, such as candidate forums, voter transportation, or voter registration. However, a facility originally assisted with ICDBG funds may be used on an incidental basis to hold political meetings, candidate forums, or voter registration campaigns, provided that all parties and organizations have access to the facility on an equal basis, and are assessed equal rent or use charges, if any.

      (b) The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds unless authorized under provisions of § 1003.203 or as otherwise specifically noted herein, or when carried out by a CBDO under the provisions of § 1003.204.

      (1)  The purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible.

      (i)  The purchase of construction equipment is ineligible, but compensation for the use of such equipment through leasing or depreciation pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, for an otherwise eligible activity is an eligible use of ICDBG funds.

      (ii)  The purchase of equipment, fixtures, motor vehicles, furnishings, or other personal property not an integral structural fixture is generally ineligible. Exceptions to this general prohibition are set forth in § 1003.201(o).

      (2)  The general rule is that any expense associated with repairing, operating or maintaining public facilities, improvements and services is ineligible. Specific exceptions to this general rule are operating and maintenance expenses associated with public service activities, interim assistance, and office space for program staff employed in carrying out the ICDBG program. For example, the use of ICDBG funds to pay the allocable costs of operating and maintaining a facility used in providing a public service would be eligible under § 1003.201(e), even if no other costs of providing such a service are assisted with such funds. Examples of ineligible operating and maintenance expenses are:

      (i) Maintenance and repair of streets, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for persons with a disability, parking and similar public facilities; and

      (ii) Payment of salaries for staff, utility costs and similar expenses necessary for the operation of public works and facilities.

      (3)  ICDBG funds may not be used for the construction of new permanent residential structures or for any program to subsidize or assist such new construction, except:

      (i) As provided under the last resort housing provisions set forth in 24 CFR part 42; or

      (ii) When carried out by a CBDO pursuant to § 1003.204(a);

      (4)  The general rule is that ICDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the ICDBG program, income payments means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing, housing (rent or mortgage) or utilities, but excludes emergency payments made over a period of up to three months to the provider of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.

      § 1003.208   Criteria for compliance with the primary objective.

#### § § 1003.208

      The Act establishes as its primary objective the development of viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. Consistent with this objective, not less than 70 percent of the expenditures of each single purpose grant shall be for activities which meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Activities meeting these criteria as applicable will be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. In assessing any such evidence, the full range of direct effects of the assisted activity will be considered. (The grantee shall appropriately ensure that activities that meet these criteria do not benefit moderate income persons to the exclusion of low income persons.)

      (a)  (1) An activity, the benefits of which are available to all the residents in a particular area, where at least 51 percent of the residents are low and moderate income persons. Such an area need not be coterminous with census tracts or other officially recognized boundaries but must be the entire area served by the activity. An activity that serves an area that is not primarily residential in character shall not qualify under this criterion.

      (2) For purposes of determining qualification under this criterion, activities of the same type that serve different areas will be considered separately on the basis of their individual service area.

      (3) In determining whether there is a sufficiently large percentage of low and moderate income persons residing in the area served by an activity to qualify under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the most recently available decennial census information shall be used to the fullest extent feasible, together with the Section 8 income limits that would have applied at the time the income information was collected by the Census Bureau. Grantees that believe that the census data does not reflect current relative income levels in an area, or where census boundaries do not coincide sufficiently well with the service area of an activity, may conduct (or have conducted) a current survey of the residents of the area to determine the percent of such persons that are low and moderate income. HUD will accept information obtained through such surveys, to be used in lieu of the decennial census data, where it determines that the survey was conducted in such a manner that the results meet standards of statistical reliability that are comparable to that of the decennial census data for areas of similar size. Where there is substantial evidence that provides a clear basis to believe that the use of the decennial census data would substantially overstate the proportion of persons residing there that are low and moderate income, HUD may require that the grantee rebut such evidence in order to demonstrate compliance with section 105(c)(2) of the Act.

      (b)  (1) An activity which benefits a limited clientele, at least 51 percent of whom are low or moderate income persons. (The following kinds of activities may not qualify under paragraph (b) of this section: Activities, the benefits of which are available to all the residents of an area; activities involving the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of property for housing; or activities where the benefit to low and moderate income persons to be considered is the creation or retention of jobs except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.) To qualify under paragraph (b) of this section, the activity must meet one of the following tests:

      (i) Benefit a clientele who are generally presumed to be principally low and moderate income persons. Activities that exclusively serve a group of persons in any one of the following categories may be presumed to benefit persons, 51 percent of whom are low-and moderate-income: abused children, battered spouses, elderly persons, adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled”, homeless persons, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, and migrant workers; or

      (ii) Require information on family size and income so that it is evident that at least 51 percent of the clientele are persons whose family income does not exceed the low and moderate income limit; or

      (iii) Have income eligibility requirements which limit the activity exclusively to low and moderate income persons; or

      (iv) Be of such nature and be in such location that it may be concluded that the activity's clientele will primarily be low and moderate income persons.

      (2) An activity that serves to remove material or architectural barriers to the mobility or accessibility of elderly persons or adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled” will be presumed to qualify under this criterion if it is restricted, to the extent practicable, to the removal of such barriers by assisting:

      (i) The reconstruction of a public facility or improvement, or portion thereof, that does not qualify under § 1003.208(a); or

      (ii) The rehabilitation of a privately-owned nonresidential building or improvement that does not qualify under § 1003.208 (a) or (d); or

      (iii) The rehabilitation of the common areas of a residential structure that contains more than one dwelling unit.

      (3) A microenterprise assistance activity carried out in accordance with the provisions of § 1003.201(l) with respect to those owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises assisted under the activity during the grant period who are low and moderate income persons. For purposes of this paragraph, persons determined to be low and moderate income may be presumed to continue to qualify for up to a three year period.

      (4) An activity designed to provide job training and placement and/or other employment support services, including but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, in which the percentage of low and moderate income persons assisted is less than 51 percent may qualify under this paragraph in the following limited circumstance:

      (i) In such cases where such training or provision of supportive services assists business(es), the only use of ICDBG assistance for the project is to provide the job training and/or supportive services; and

      (ii) The proportion of the total cost of the project borne by ICDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of the total number of persons assisted who are low or moderate income.

      (c)  An eligible activity carried out for the purpose of providing or improving permanent residential structures which, upon completion, will be occupied by low and moderate income households. This would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the acquisition or rehabilitation of property, conversion of non-residential structures, and new housing construction. Funds expended for activities which qualify under the provisions of this paragraph shall be counted as benefiting low and moderate income persons but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including ICDBG and non-ICDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing to be occupied by low and moderate income persons. If the structure assisted contains two dwelling units, at least one must be occupied by low and moderate income households, and if the structure contains more than two dwelling units, at least 51 percent of the units must be so occupied. Where two or more rental buildings being assisted are or will be located on the same or contiguous properties, and the buildings will be under common ownership and management, the grouped buildings may be considered for this purpose as a single structure. For rental housing, occupancy by low and moderate income households must be at affordable rents to qualify under this criterion. The grantee shall adopt and make public its standards for determining “affordable rents” for this purpose. The following shall also qualify under this criterion:

      (1) When less than 51 percent of the units in a structure will be occupied by low and moderate income households, ICDBG assistance may be provided in the following limited circumstances:

      (i) The assistance is for an eligible activity to reduce the development cost of the new construction of a multifamily, non-elderly rental housing project;

      (ii) Not less than 20 percent of the units will be occupied by low and moderate income households at affordable rents; and

      (iii) The proportion of the total cost of developing the project to be borne by ICDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of units in the project that will be occupied by low and moderate income households.

      (2) When ICDBG funds are used for housing services eligible under § 1003.201(j), such funds shall be considered to benefit low-and moderate-income persons if the housing for which the services are provided is to be occupied by low-and moderate-income households.

      (d)  An activity designed to create or retain permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low and moderate persons. For purposes of determining whether a job is held by or made available to a low or moderate income person, the person may be presumed to be a low or moderate income person if: he/she resides within a census tract (or block numbering area) where not less than 70 percent of the residents have incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median; or, if he/she resides in a census tract (or block numbering area) which meets the Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community eligibility criteria; or, if the assisted business is located in and the job under consideration is to be located in such a tract or area. As a general rule, each assisted business shall be considered to be a separate activity for purposes of determining whether the activity qualifies under this paragraph. However, in certain cases such as where ICDBG funds are used to acquire, develop or improve a real property (e.g., a business incubator or an industrial park) the requirement may be met by measuring jobs in the aggregate for all the businesses which locate on the property, provided such businesses are not otherwise assisted by ICDBG funds. Where ICDBG funds are used to pay for the staff and overhead costs of a CBDO under the provisions of § 1003.204 making loans to businesses from non-ICDBG funds, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created by all of the businesses receiving loans during any one year period. For an activity that creates jobs, the grantee must document that at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by, or will be available to, low and moderate income persons. For an activity that retains jobs, the grantee must document that the jobs would actually be lost without the ICDBG assistance and that either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to at least 51 percent of the jobs at the time the ICDBG assistance is provided: The job is known to be held by a low or moderate income person; or the job can reasonably be expected to turn over within the following two years and that steps will be taken to ensure that it will be filled by, or made available to, a low or moderate income person upon turnover. Jobs will be considered to be available to low and moderate income persons for these purposes only if:

      (1) Special skills that can only be acquired with substantial training or work experience or education beyond high school are not a prerequisite to fill such jobs, or the business agrees to hire unqualified persons and provide training; and

      (2) The grantee and the assisted business take actions to ensure that low and moderate income persons receive first consideration for filling such jobs.

      (e)  (1) Where the assisted activity is acquisition of real property, a preliminary determination of whether the activity addresses the primary objective may be based on the planned use of the property after acquisition. A final determination shall be based on the actual use of the property, excluding any short-term, temporary use.

      (2) Where the assisted activity is relocation assistance that the grantee is required to provide, such relocation assistance shall be considered to address the primary objective as addressed by the displacing activity.

      (3) In any case where the activity undertaken for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs is a public improvement and the area served is primarily residential, the activity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as well as those of paragraph (d) of this section in order to qualify as benefiting low and moderate income persons.

      (4) Expenditures for activities meeting the criteria for benefiting low and moderate income persons shall be used in determining the extent to which the grantee's overall program benefits such persons. In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activities:

      (i) Costs of administration and planning, eligible under § 1003.205 and § 1003.206 respectively, will be assumed to benefit low and moderate income persons in the same proportion as the remainder of the ICDBG funds and, accordingly, shall be excluded from the calculation.

      (ii) Funds expended for the acquisition, new construction or rehabilitation of property for housing those qualified under § 1003.208(c) shall be counted for this purpose, but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including ICDBG and non-ICDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing occupied by low and moderate income persons.

      (iii) Funds expended for any other activity which qualifies under § 1003.208 shall be counted for this purpose in their entirety.

      § 1003.209   Prohibition on use of assistance for employment relocation activities.

#### § § 1003.209

      (a)  ICDBG funds may not be used to directly assist a business, including a business expansion, in the relocation of a plant, facility, or operation from one Identified Service Area to another Identified Service Area, if the relocation is likely to result in a significant loss of jobs in the Identified Service Area from which the relocation occurs.

      (b)  The following definitions apply to this section:

      (1)  Directly assist means the provision of ICDBG funds for activities pursuant to:

      (i) § 1003.203(b); or

      (ii) §§ 1003.201(a)-(d), 1003.201(k), 1003.203(a), or § 1003.204 when the grantee, subrecipient, or, in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 1003.204, a Community Based Development Organization (CBDO) enters into an agreement with a business to undertake one or more of these activities as a condition of the business relocating a facility, plant, or operation to the grantee's Identified Service Area. Provision of public facilities and indirect assistance that will provide benefit to multiple businesses does not fall under the definition of “directly assist,” unless it includes the provision of infrastructure to aid a specific business that is the subject of an agreement with the specific assisted business.

      (2)  The relevant definition of “area” for a Native American economic development project is the “Identified Service Area” for the eligible applicant, as defined in § 1003.4.

      (3)  A business operation includes, but is not limited to, any equipment, employment opportunity, production capacity, or product line of the business.

      (4)  (i) A loss of jobs is significant if the number of jobs to be lost in the Identified Service Area in which the affected business is currently located is equal to or greater than one-tenth of one percent of the total number of persons in the labor force of that area; or, in all cases, a loss of 500 or more jobs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a loss of 25 jobs or fewer does not constitute a significant loss of jobs.

      (ii) A job is considered to be lost due to the provision of ICDBG assistance if the job is relocated within 3 years of the provision of assistance to the business; or the time period within which jobs are to be created, as specified by the agreement between the business and the recipient, is longer than 3 years.

      (c)  Before directly assisting a business with ICDBG funds, the recipient, subrecipient, or a CBDO (in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 1003.204) shall sign a written agreement with the assisted business. The written agreement shall include:

      (1)  A statement from the assisted business as to whether the assisted activity will result in the relocation of any industrial or commercial plant, facility, or operation from one Identified Service Area to another, and, if so, the number of jobs that will be relocated from each Identified Service Area; and

      (2)  If the assistance will not result in a relocation covered by this section, a certification from the assisted business that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries, has plans to relocate jobs, at the time the agreement is signed, that would result in a significant job loss as defined in this rule.

      (d)  This section does not apply to:

      (1)  Relocation assistance under § 1003.602(b), (c), or (d);

      (2)  Assistance to microenterprises as defined by section 102(a)(22) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974; and

      (3)  Assistance to a business that purchases business equipment, inventory, or other physical assets in an arms-length transaction, including the assets of an existing business, provided that the purchase does not result in the relocation of the sellers' business operation (including customer base or list, goodwill, product lines, or trade names) from one Identified Service Area to another Identified Service Area and does not produce a significant loss of jobs in the Identified Service Area from which the relocation occurs.

      § 1003.302   Project specific threshold requirements.

#### § § 1003.302

      (a)  All applicants for housing rehabilitation projects shall adopt rehabilitation standards and rehabilitation policies before submitting an application. The applicant shall assure that it will use project funds to rehabilitate units only when the homeowner's payments are current or the homeowner is current in a repayment agreement that is subject to approval by the Area ONAP. The Area ONAP administrator may grant exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-case basis.

      (b)  New housing construction can only be implemented through a nonprofit organization that is eligible under § 1003.204 or is otherwise eligible under § 1003.207(b)(3). All applicants for new housing construction projects shall adopt, by current tribal resolution, construction standards before submitting an application. All applications which include new housing construction projects must document that:

      (1) No other housing is available in the immediate reservation area that is suitable for the household(s) to be assisted; and

      (2) No other sources can meet the needs of the household(s) to be assisted; and

      (3) Rehabilitation of the unit occupied by the household(s) to be assisted is not economically feasible; or

      (4) The household(s) to be housed currently is in an overcrowded housing unit (sharing with another household); or

      (5) The household(s) to be assisted has no current residence.

      (c)  All applicants for economic development projects must provide an analysis which shows public benefit commensurate with the ICDBG assistance requested will result from the assisted project. This analysis should also establish that to the extent practicable: reasonable financial support will be committed from non-Federal sources prior to disbursement of Federal funds; any grant amount provided will not substantially reduce the amount of non-Federal financial support for the activity; not more than a reasonable rate of return on investment is provided to the owner; and, that grant funds used for the project will be disbursed on a pro rata basis with amounts from other sources. In addition, it must be established that the project is financially feasible and that it has a reasonable chance of success.

      § 1003.303   Project rating.

#### § § 1003.303

      Each project included in an application that meets the threshold requirements shall be competitively rated within each Area ONAP's jurisdiction under the five following rating factors. Additional details regarding the rating factors will be provided in the periodic NOFAs.

      (a)  This factor will address the applicant's organizational resources necessary to successfully implement the proposed activities in a timely manner.

      (b)  This factor will address the extent to which there is a need for the proposed project to address a documented problem among the intended beneficiaries.

      (c)  This factor will address the quality and cost effectiveness of the proposed project, the commitment to sustain the proposed activities, and the degree to which the proposed project provides other benefits to community members.

      (d)  This factor will address the level of tribal resources and resources from other entities that are used in conjunction with ICDBG funds to support the proposed project. HUD will evaluate the level of non-ICDBG resources based on the percentage of non-ICDBG resources provided relative to project costs.

      (e)  This factor will address the extent to which the applicant's proposed activities are consistent with the strategic plans or policy goals of the community and further on-going priorities and activities of the community.

      § 1003.304   Funding process.

#### § § 1003.304

      (a)  Area ONAPs will notify applicants of the approval or disapproval of their applications. Grant amounts offered may reflect adjustments made by the Area ONAPs in accordance with § 1003.100(b)(2).

      (b)  (1) As soon as the Area ONAP determines that the applicant has complied with any pre-award requirements and absent information which would alter the threshold determinations under § 1003.302, the grant will be awarded. The regulations become part of the grant agreement.

      (2) All grants shall be conditioned upon the completion of all environmental obligations and approval of release of funds by HUD in accordance with the requirements of part 58 of this title and, in particular, subpart J of part 58 of this title, except as otherwise provided in part 58 of this title.

      (3) HUD may impose other grant conditions where additional actions or approvals are required before the use of funds.

      § 1003.305   Program amendments.

#### § § 1003.305

      (a) Grantees shall request prior HUD approval for program amendments which will significantly change the scope, location, objective, or class of beneficiaries of the approved activities, as originally described in the application.

      (b) Amendment requests of $100,000 or more shall include all application components required by the NOFA published for the last application cycle; those requests of less than $100,000 do not have to include the components which address the selection criteria.

      (c) Approval of an amendment request is subject to the following:

      (1) A rating equal to or greater than the lowest rating received by a funded project during the most recent funding competition must be attained by the amended project if the request is for $100,000 or more;

      (2) Demonstration by the grantee of the capacity to promptly complete the modified or new activities;

      (3) Demonstration by the grantee of compliance with the requirements of § 1003.604 for citizen participation; and

      (d) Amendments which address imminent threats to health and safety shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the requirements of subpart E of this part.

      (e) If a program amendment fails to be approved and the original project is no longer feasible, the grant funds proposed for amendment shall be recaptured by HUD.

    Subpart E—Imminent Threat Grants

      § 1003.400   Criteria for funding.

#### § § 1003.400

      The following criteria apply to requests for assistance under this subpart:

      (a) In response to requests for assistance, HUD may make funds available under this subpart to applicants to alleviate or remove imminent threats to health or safety. The urgency and immediacy of the threat shall be independently verified before the approval of an application. Funds may only be used to deal with imminent threats that are not of a recurring nature and which represent a unique and unusual circumstance, and which impact on an entire service area.

      (b) Funds to alleviate imminent threats may be granted only if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of HUD that other tribal or Federal funding sources cannot be made available to alleviate the threat.

      (c) HUD will establish grant ceilings for imminent threat applications.

      § 1003.401   Application process.

#### § § 1003.401

      (a)  The Area ONAP may issue the applicant a letter to proceed to incur costs to alleviate imminent threats to health and safety only if the assisted activities do not alter environmental conditions and are for temporary or permanent improvements limited to protection, repair, or restoration actions necessary only to control or arrest the effects of imminent threats or physical deterioration. Reimbursement of such costs is dependent upon HUD approval of the application.

      (b)  Applications shall include the information specified in the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).

      (c)  Applications which meet the requirement of this section may be approved by the Area ONAP without competition in accordance with the applicable requirements of § 1003.304.

      § 1003.402   Availability of funds.

#### § § 1003.402

      Of the funds made available by the NOFA for the ICDBG program, an amount to be determined by the Assistant Secretary may be reserved by HUD for grants under this subpart. The amount of funds reserved for imminent threat funding during each funding cycle will be stated in the NOFA. If any of the reserved funds are not used to fund imminent threat grants during a fiscal year, they will be added to the allocation of ICDBG funds for the subsequent fiscal year and will be used as if they were a part of the new allocation.

    Subpart F—Grant Administration

      § 1003.500   Responsibility for grant administration.

#### § § 1003.500

      (a) One or more tribal departments or authorities, including existing tribal public agencies, may be designated by the chief executive officer of the grantee to undertake activities assisted by this part. A public agency so designated shall be subject to the same requirements as are applicable to subrecipients.

      (b) The grantee is responsible for ensuring that ICDBG funds are used in accordance with all program requirements. The use of designated public agencies, subrecipients, or contractors does not relieve the grantee of this responsibility. The grantee is also responsible for determining the adequacy of performance under subrecipient agreements and procurement contracts, and for taking appropriate action when performance problems arise, such as the actions described in § 1003.701.

      § 1003.501   Applicability of uniform administrative requirements and cost principles.

#### § § 1003.501

      (a) Grantees and subrecipients shall comply with the requirements and standards of 2 CFR part 200, except for the following sections:

      (1) Paragraph (a) of § 200.302, “Financial management.”

      (2) Section 200.306, “Cost sharing or matching.”

      (3) Section 200.307, “Program income” applies as modified by § 1003.503.

      (4) Section 200.308, “Revisions of budget and program plans.”

      (5) Section 200.311, “Real property,” except as provided in § 1003.600.

      (6) Section 200.313, “Equipment” applies, except that in all cases in which the equipment is sold, the proceeds shall be program income.

      (7) Section 200.314, “Supplies,” applies, except in all cases in which the supplies are sold, the proceeds shall be program income.

      (8) Section 200.325, “Bonding requirements” applies. However, there may be circumstances under which the bonding requirements of 2 CFR 200.325 are inconsistent with other responsibilities and obligations of the grantee. In such circumstances, acceptable methods to provide performance and payment assurance may include:

      (i) Deposit with the grantee of a cash escrow of not less than 20 percent of the total contract price, subject to reduction during the warranty period, commensurate with potential risk; or

      (ii) Letter of credit for 25 percent of the total contract price, unconditionally payable upon demand of the grantee, subject to reduction during the warranty period commensurate with potential risk.

      (9) Paragraphs (b) through (d) and (f) of § 200.328, “Monitoring and reporting program performance.”

      (10) Section 200.333, “Retention requirements for records” applies. However, the retention period referenced in 2 CFR 200.333 pertaining to individual ICDBG activities starts from the date of the submission of the final status and evaluation report as prescribed in § 1003.506(a) in which the specific activity is reported.

      (11) Section 200.343, “Closeout.”

      (b)  (1) All items of cost listed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, which require prior Federal agency approval are allowable without the prior approval of HUD to the extent that they comply with the general policies and principles stated in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and are otherwise eligible under subpart C of this part, except for the following:

      (i) Depreciation methods for fixed assets shall not be changed without the approval of the Federal cognizant agency.

      (ii) Fines, penalties, damages, and other settlements are unallowable costs to the ICDBG program.

      (iii) Costs of housing ( depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances and personal living expenses (goods or services for personal use), regardless of whether reported as taxable income to the employees (2 CFR 200.445), require HUD prior approval.

      (iv) Organization costs (2 CFR 200.455) require HUD prior approval.

      (2) No person providing consultant services in an employer-employee type of relationship shall receive more than a reasonable rate of compensation for personal services paid with ICDBG funds. In no event, however, shall such compensation exceed the equivalent of the daily rate paid for Level IV of the Executive Schedule.

      § 1003.502   Agreements with subrecipients.

#### § § 1003.502

      (a) Before disbursing any ICDBG funds to a subrecipient, the grantee shall sign a written agreement with the subrecipient. The agreement shall remain in effect during any period that the subrecipient has control over ICDBG funds, including program income.

      (b) At a minimum, the written agreement with the subrecipient shall include provisions concerning the following items:

      (1)  The agreement shall include a description of the work to be performed, a schedule for completing the work, and a budget. These items shall be in sufficient detail to provide a sound basis for the grantee effectively to monitor performance under the agreement.

      (2)  The grantee shall specify in the agreement the particular records the subrecipient must maintain and the particular reports the subrecipient must submit in order to assist the grantee in meeting its recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

      (3)  The agreement shall include the program income requirements set forth in § 2 CFR 200.307 as modified by § 1003.503.

      (4)  The agreement shall require the subrecipient to comply with applicable administrative requirements, as described in § 1003.501.

      (5)  The agreement shall require the subrecipient to carry out each activity in compliance with all Federal laws and regulations described in subpart G of this part, except that the subrecipient does not assume the grantee's environmental responsibilities described at § 1003.605.

      (6)  Where applicable, the conditions prescribed by HUD for the use of ICDBG funds by religious organizations shall be included in the agreement.

      (7)  The agreement shall set forth remedies for noncompliance and provisions on termination in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D.

      (8)  The agreement shall specify that upon its expiration the subrecipient shall transfer to the grantee any ICDBG funds on hand at the time of expiration and any accounts receivable attributable to the use of ICDBG funds. It shall also include provisions designed to ensure that any real property under the subrecipient's control that was acquired or improved in whole or in part with ICDBG funds (including ICDBG funds provided to the subrecipient in the form of a loan) in excess of $25,000 is either:

      (i) Used to meet the primary objective as stated in § 1003.208 until five years after expiration of the agreement, or for such longer period of time as determined to be appropriate by the grantee; or

      (ii) Not used in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, in which event the subrecipient shall pay to the grantee an amount equal to the current market value of the property less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-ICDBG funds for the acquisition of, or improvement to, the property. The payment is program income to the grantee if it is received during the grant period. (No payment is required after the period of time specified in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section.)

      § 1003.503   Program income.

#### § § 1003.503

      (a) Program income requirements for ICDBG grantees are set forth in 2 CFR 200.307, as modified by this section.

      (b)  means gross income received by the grantee or a subrecipient directly generated from the use of ICDBG funds during the grant period, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. When program income is generated by an activity that is only partially assisted with ICDBG funds, the income shall be prorated to reflect the percentage of ICDBG funds used.

      (1) Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:

      (i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with ICDBG funds;

      (ii) Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with ICDBG funds;

      (iii) Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the grantee or by a subrecipient with ICDBG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;

      (iv) Gross income from the use or rental of real property, owned by the grantee or by a subrecipient, that was constructed or improved with ICDBG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;

      (v) Payments of principal and interest on loans made using ICDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;

      (vi) Proceeds from the sale of loans made with ICDBG funds except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section;

      (vii) Proceeds from sale of obligations secured by loans made with ICDBG funds;

      (viii) Interest earned on funds held in a revolving fund account;

      (ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and

      (x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households not of low and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or part of the ICDBG portion of a public improvement.

      (2) Program income does not include income earned on grant advances from the U.S. Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to the U.S. Treasury and will not be reallocated:

      (i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U.S. Treasury;

      (ii) Income (e.g., interest) earned on loans or other forms of assistance provided with ICDBG funds that are used for activities determined by HUD either to be ineligible or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part.

      (3) The calculation of the amount of program income for the grantee's ICDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/or interest on loans received from grantees where such payments are made from program income received by the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred program income to the grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for reporting purposes and in determining limitations on planning and administration and public services activities to be paid for with ICDBG funds.

      (4) Program income does not include any income received in a single year by the grantee and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such income does not exceed $25,000.

      (5) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fundraising activities carried out by subrecipients receiving ICDBG assistance; funds collected through special assessments used to recover the non-ICDBG portion of a public improvement; and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or improved with ICDBG funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in § 1003.502(b)(8) for subrecipient-controlled property, or in § 1003.504 for grantee-controlled property.

      (6) For purposes of determining the applicability of the program income requirements included in this part and in 2 CFR 200.307, the grant period is the time between the effective date of the grant agreement and the close-out of the grant pursuant to the requirements of § 1003.508.

      (7) As provided for in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(2), program income received will be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement and shall be used for purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.

      (8) Recording program income. The receipt and expenditure of program income as defined in § 1003.503(b) shall be recorded as part of the financial transactions of the grant program.

      § 1003.504   Use of real property.

#### § § 1003.504

      The standards described in this section apply to real property within the grantee's control which was acquired or improved in whole or in part using ICDBG funds in excess of $25,000. These standards shall apply from the date ICDBG funds are first spent for the property until five years after the closeout of the grant from which the assistance to the property was provided.

      (a) A grantee may not change the use or planned use of any such property (including the beneficiaries of such use) from that for which the acquisition or improvement was made unless the grantee provides affected citizens with reasonable notice of, and opportunity to comment on, any proposed change, and either:

      (1) The new use of such property qualifies as meeting the primary objective set forth in § 1003.208 and is not a building for the general conduct of government; or

      (2) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met.

      (b) If the grantee determines, after consultation with affected citizens, that it is appropriate to change the use of the property to a use which does not qualify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it may retain or dispose of the property for the changed use if the grantee's ICDBG program is reimbursed in the amount of the current fair market value of the property, less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-ICDBG funds for acquisition of, and improvements to, the property.

      (c) If the change of use occurs after program closeout, the proceeds from the disposition of the real property shall be used for activities which meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subpart C of this part and the primary objective set forth in § 1003.208.

      (d) Following the reimbursement of the ICDBG program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any ICDBG requirements.

      § 1003.508   Grant closeout procedures.

#### § § 1003.508

      (a)  A grant will be closed out when the Area ONAP determines, in consultation with the grantee, that the following criteria have been met:

      (1) All costs to be paid with ICDBG funds have been incurred, with the exception of closeout costs (e.g., audit costs) and costs resulting from contingent liabilities described in the closeout agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Contingent liabilities include, but are not limited to, third-party claims against the grantee, as well as related administrative costs.

      (2) With respect to activities which are financed by means of escrow accounts, loan guarantees, or similar mechanisms, the work to be assisted with ICDBG funds has actually been completed.

      (3) Other responsibilities of the grantee under the grant agreement and applicable laws and regulations appear to have been carried out satisfactorily or there is no further Federal interest in keeping the grant agreement open for the purpose of securing performance.

      (b)  (1) Within 90 days of the date it is determined that the criteria for closeout have been met, the grantee shall submit to the Area ONAP a copy of the final status and evaluation report described in § 1003.506(a) and a completed Financial Status Report (SF-269). If acceptable reports are not submitted, an audit of the grantee's program activities may be conducted by HUD.

      (2) Based on the information provided in the status report and other relevant information, the grantee, in consultation with the Area ONAP, will prepare a closeout agreement in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) The Area ONAP will cancel any unused portion of the awarded grant, as shown in the signed grant closeout agreement. Any unused grant funds disbursed from the U.S. Treasury which are in the possession of the grantee shall be refunded to HUD.

      (4) Any costs paid with ICDBG funds which were not audited previously shall be subject to coverage in the grantee's next single audit performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. The grantee may be required to repay HUD any disallowed costs based on the results of the audit, or on additional HUD reviews provided for in the closeout agreement.

      (c)  Any obligations remaining as of the date of the closeout shall be covered by the terms of a closeout agreement. The agreement shall be prepared by the grantee in consultation with the Area ONAP. The agreement shall identify the grant being closed out, and include provisions with respect to the following:

      (1) Identification of any closeout costs or contingent liabilities subject to payment with ICDBG funds after the closeout agreement is signed;

      (2) Identification of any unused grant funds to be canceled by HUD;

      (3) Identification of any program income on deposit in financial institutions at the time the closeout agreement is signed;

      (4) Description of the grantee's responsibility after closeout for:

      (i) Compliance with all program requirements, certifications and assurances in using program income on deposit at the time the closeout agreement is signed and in using any other remaining ICDBG funds available for closeout costs and contingent liabilities;

      (ii) Use of real property assisted with ICDBG funds in accordance with the principles described in § 1003.504; and

      (iii) Ensuring that flood insurance coverage for affected property owners is maintained for the mandatory period;

      (5) Other provisions appropriate to any special circumstances of the grant closeout, in modification of or in addition to the obligations in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section. The agreement shall authorize monitoring by HUD, and shall provide that findings of noncompliance may be taken into account by HUD as unsatisfactory performance of the grantee in the consideration of any future grant award under this part.

      (d)  Grant assistance provided under this part may be terminated for convenience in whole or in part before the completion of the assisted activities, in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200.339. The grantee shall not incur new obligations for the terminated portions after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. HUD shall allow full credit to the grantee for those portions of obligations which could not be canceled and which had been properly incurred by the grantee in carrying out the activities before the termination. The closeout policies contained in this section shall apply in such cases, except where the approved grant is terminated in its entirety. Responsibility for the environmental review to be performed under 24 CFR part 50 or 24 CFR part 58, as applicable, shall be determined as part of the closeout process.

      (e)  In cases in which HUD terminates the grantee's grant under the authority of subpart H of this part, or under the terms of the grant agreement, the closeout policies contained in this section shall apply, except where the approved grant is canceled in its entirety. The provisions in 2 CFR 200.342 on the effects of termination shall also apply. HUD shall determine whether an environmental review is required, and if so, HUD shall perform it in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.

      (1) Documentation to indicate that it has carried out or can carry out successfully a project of the size and scope of the proposal;

      (2) Documentation to indicate that it has obtained or can obtain adequate supervision for the workers to be used;

      § 1003.510   Indian preference requirements.

#### § § 1003.510

      (a) Applicability. HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b). Section 7(b) provides that any contract, subcontract, grant or subgrant pursuant to an act authorizing grants to Indian organizations or for the benefit of Indians shall require that, to the greatest extent feasible:

      (1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and

      (2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452).

      (b)  (1) The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450b] defines “Indian” to mean a person who is a member of an Indian tribe and defines “Indian tribe” to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community including any Alaska native village or regional or village corporation as defined or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

      (2) In section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452)  is defined as any Indian—owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit, except that Indian ownership must constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise. This act defines  to mean the governing body of any Indian tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body.

      (c)  To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians.

      (d)  To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.

      (1) Each grantee shall:

      (i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or

      (ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:

      (A)  Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.

      (B)  If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or

      (iii) Develop, subject to Area ONAP one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.

      (2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the grantee shall:

      (i) Re-advertise the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or

      (ii) Re-advertise the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or

      (iii) If one approvable bid or proposal is received, request Area ONAP review and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.320, in order to award the contract to the single bidder or offeror.

      (3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 2 CFR 200.320 need not follow the formal bid or proposal procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of2 CFR 200.320. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.

      (4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding or proposal solicitation documents and the bidding and proposal documents.

      (5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. Grantees may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission:

      (i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership and interest;

      (ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and

      (iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.

      (6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded in connection with a project funded under this part:

      (i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible:

      (A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and

      (B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.

      (ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

      (iii) In connection with this contract, the contractor shall, to the greatest extent feasible, give preference in the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and opportunities for training and employment to Indians.

      (iv) The contractor shall include this Section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project, and shall, at the direction of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the grantee or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act.

      (e)  The following complaint procedures are applicable to complaints arising out of any of the methods of providing for Indian preference contained in this part, including alternate methods enacted and approved in a manner described in this section:

      (1) Each complaint shall be in writing, signed, and filed with the grantee.

      (2) A complaint must be filed with the grantee no later than 20 calendar days from the date of the action (or omission) upon which the complaint is based.

      (3) Upon receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall promptly stamp the date and time of receipt upon the complaint, and immediately acknowledge its receipt.

      (4) Within 20 calendar days of receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall either meet, or communicate by mail or telephone, with the complainant in an effort to resolve the matter. The grantee shall make a determination on a complaint and notify the complainant, in writing, within 30 calendar days of the submittal of the complaint to the grantee. The decision of the grantee shall constitute final administrative action on the complaint.

      § 1003.511   Use of escrow accounts for rehabilitation of privately owned residential property.

#### § § 1003.511

      (a)  A grantee may withdraw funds from its line of credit for immediate deposit into an escrow account for use in funding loans and grants for the rehabilitation of privately owned residential property under § 1003.202(a)(1). The following additional limitations apply to the use of escrow accounts for residential rehabilitation loans and grants closed after September 7, 1990:

      (1) The use of escrow accounts under this section is limited to loans and grants for the rehabilitation of primarily residential properties containing no more than four dwelling units (and accessory neighborhood-scale non-residential space within the same structure, if any, e.g., a store front below a dwelling unit).

      (2) An escrow account shall not be used unless the contract between the property owner and the contractor selected to do the rehabilitation work specifically provides that payment to the contractor shall be made through an escrow account maintained by the grantee, by a subrecipient as defined in § 1003.4, by a public agency designated under § 1003.500(a), or by an agent under a procurement contact governed by the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D. No deposit to the escrow account shall be made until after the contract has been executed between the property owner and the rehabilitation contractor.

      (3) All funds withdrawn under this section shall be deposited into one interest earning account with a financial institution. Separate bank accounts shall not be established for individual loans and grants.

      (4) The amount of funds deposited into an escrow account shall be limited to the amount expected to be disbursed within 10 working days from the date of deposit. If the escrow account, for whatever reason, at any time contains funds exceeding 10 days cash needs, the grantee immediately shall transfer the excess funds to its program account. In the program account, the excess funds shall be treated as funds erroneously drawn in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Treasury Financial Manual, paragraph 6-2075.30.

      (5) Funds deposited into an escrow account shall be used only to pay the actual costs of rehabilitation incurred by the owner under the contract with a private contractor. Other eligible costs related to the rehabilitation loan or grant, e.g., the grantee's administrative costs under § 1003.206 or rehabilitation services costs under § 1003.202(b)(9), are not permissible uses of escrowed funds. Such other eligible rehabilitation costs shall be paid under normal ICDBG payment procedures (e.g., from withdrawals of grant funds under the grantee's line of credit with the Treasury).

      (b)  Interest earned on escrow accounts established in accordance with this section, less any service charges for the account, shall be remitted to HUD at least quarterly but not more frequently than monthly. Interest earned on escrow accounts is not required to be remitted to HUD to the extent the interest is attributable to the investment of program income.

      (c)  If HUD determines that a grantee has failed to use an escrow account in accordance with this section, HUD may, in addition to imposing any other sanctions provided for under this part, require the grantee to discontinue the use of escrow accounts, in whole or in part.

#### § § 1003.601

      (a) Under the authority of section 107(e)(2) of the Act, the Secretary waives the requirement that grantees comply with section 109 of the Act except with respect to the prohibition of discrimination based on age, sex, religion, or against an otherwise qualified disabled individual.

      (b) A grantee shall comply with the provisions of title II of Pub. L. 90-284 (24 U.S.C. 1301—the Indian Civil Rights Act) in the administration of a program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this part. For purposes of this section, “program or activity” is defined as any function conducted by an identifiable administrative unit of the grantee; and “funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this part” means that ICDBG funds in any amount have been transferred by the grantee to an identifiable administrative unit and disbursed in a program or activity.

      (c) A grantee shall comply with the equal access to HUD-assisted or -insured housing requirements in 24 CFR 5.105(a)(2).

      § 1003.602   Relocation and real property acquisition.

#### § § 1003.602

      (a)  Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, grantees shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under this part.

      (b)  The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:

      (1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly housing costs (e.g., rent/utility costs).

      (2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:

      (i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;

      (ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;

      (iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the repairs; and

      (iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c)  A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

      (d)  Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required. For assistance that is not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.

      (e)  The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the grantee does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall:

      (1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:

      (i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the grantee from accepting a donation or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value.

      (ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement.

      (2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property. The grantee shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when applicable, a justification for any proposed acquisition payment that exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review the proposal and inform the grantee of its approval or disapproval.

      (f)  A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee. A person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Area ONAP.

      (g)  (1) The grantee shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section,  provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24. The grantee shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with these provisions.

      (2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the grantee from any other source.

      (3) The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.

      (h)  (1) For purposes of this section, the term  means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term “_displaced person_” includes, but is not limited to:

      (i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an application for financial assistance that is later approved.

      (ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, that either HUD or the grantee determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

      (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently, after the execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

      (A) The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or

      (B) 30 percent of gross household income.

      (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:

      (A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or

      (B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.

      (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:

      (A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

      (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

      (i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;

      (ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).

      (iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

      (3) A grantee may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.

      (i)  For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition.

#### § § 1003.606

      (a)  (1) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by grantees and subgrantees, the conflict of interest provisions in 2 CFR 200.112, 200.318(c), and 200.319(a)(5) shall apply.

      (2) In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.318, the provisions of this section shall apply. Such cases include the provision of assistance by the grantee or by its subrecipients to businesses, individuals, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance (e.g., rehabilitation, preservation, and other improvements of private properties or facilities under § 1003.202; or grants, loans, and other assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities under § 1003.203 or § 1003.204.).

      (b)  Except for the use of ICDBG funds to pay salaries and other related administrative or personnel costs, the general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to ICDBG activities assisted under this part or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from an ICDBG assisted activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or those with whom they have family or business ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter.

      (c)  The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the grantee, or of any designated public agencies, or CBDOs under § 1003.204, receiving funds under this part.

      (d) —(1)  Upon the written request of a grantee, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section on a case-by-case basis, when it determines that such an exception will serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the grantee's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the grantee has provided the following:

      (i) A disclosure of the nature of the possible conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and

      (ii) An opinion of the grantee's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate Tribal laws on conflict of interest, or applicable State laws.

      (2)  In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the grantee has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:

      (i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;

      (ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;

      (iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question;

      (iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b) of this section;

      (v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the grantee or to the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;

      (vi) Any other relevant considerations.

      (e)  (1) In instances where a person who might otherwise be deemed to be included under the conflict prohibition is a member of a group or class of beneficiaries of the assisted activity and receives generally the same interest or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class, the prohibition does not apply, except that if, by not applying the prohibition against conflict of interest, a violation of Tribal or State laws on conflict of interest would result, the prohibition does apply. However, if the assistance to be provided is housing rehabilitation (or repair) or new housing, a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the specific basis for the selection of the proposed beneficiaries must be made prior to the submission of an application to HUD. Evidence of this disclosure must be provided as a component of the application.

      (f)  All records pertaining to the grantee's decision under this section shall be maintained for HUD review upon request.

        § 1005.415   Sale of property.

#### § § 1005.415

        (b)  The Direct Guarantee Lender shall obtain and submit to HUD documentation verifying that the seller is the Owner of Record as part of the application for a loan guarantee under the Section 184 Program. Documentation must conform with the requirements set out in Section 184 Program Guidance. This documentation may include, but is not limited to, a property ownership history report from the State or local government, a copy of the recorded deed or other HUD approved document issued by the Tribe, as provided by Section 184 Program Guidance and the document evidences the property interest rights, as permitted by this subpart from the seller, or other documentation (such as a copy of a property tax bill, title commitment, or binder) demonstrating the seller's ownership.

        (c) —(1)  The eligibility of a property for a Loan guaranteed by HUD is dependent on the time that has elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the HUD guarantee (the re-sale date). The Direct Guarantee Lender shall obtain documentation verifying compliance with the time restrictions described in this paragraph and must submit this documentation to HUD as part of the application for the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, in accordance with § 1005.501.

        (2)  If the re-sale date is 90 days or less following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is not eligible under the Section 184 Program.

        (3)  (i) If the re-sale date is between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition by the seller, the property is generally eligible under the Section 184 Program.

        (ii) However, HUD will require that the Direct Guarantee Lender obtain additional documentation if the re-sale price is 100 percent over the purchase price. Such documentation must include a second appraisal from a different appraiser. The Direct Guarantee Lender may also document its Loan file to support the increased value by establishing that the increased value results from the rehabilitation of the property.

        (iii) Additional documentation may be required, as prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (4)  (i) If the re-sale date is more than 181 days after the date of acquisition by the seller, but before the end of the twelfth month after the date of acquisition, the property is eligible under the Section 184 Program.

        (ii) However, HUD may require that the Direct Guarantee Lender provide additional documentation to support the re-sale value of the property if the re-sale price is 5 percent or greater than the lowest sales price of the property during the preceding 12 months (as evidenced by the contract of sale). At HUD's discretion, such documentation must include, but is not limited to, a second appraisal from a different appraiser. HUD may exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements.

        (iii) If the additional value documentation supports a value of the property that is more than 5 percent lower than the value supported by the first appraisal, the lower value will be used to calculate the maximum principal loan amount under § 1005.443. Otherwise, the value supported by the first appraisal will be used to calculate the maximum principal loan amount.

        (iv) Additional value documentation may be prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (5)  If the re-sale date is more than 12 months following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is eligible under the Section 184 Program.

        (c) Upon review, if HUD determines the loan to meet program requirements, HUD will issue a Loan Guarantee Certificate. If HUD determines the loan is ineligible, HUD will provide the Direct Guarantee Lender with a written determination and specify any available corrective actions that may be available.

        (4) A certified true copy of the recorded executed mortgage release documents for all prior mortgages identified on the initial certified TSR, if applicable; and

        (5) A certified true copy of any BIA approved and executed subordination agreements;

        (c) The Loan Guarantee Certificate is conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the Loan for guarantee under this part. Such evidence will be incontestable in the hands of the bearer and the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of amounts agreed to be paid by HUD as security for such obligations.

        (d) This section may not be construed to preclude HUD from conducting a post-endorsement review. With respect to the original Direct Guarantee Lender, HUD may establish defenses against the original Direct Guarantee Lender based on fraud or material misrepresentation. This section may not be construed to bar HUD from establishing partial defenses to the amount payable on the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan.

        (d) Based on HUD's review under paragraph (a) of this section, if HUD determines that:

        (1) The Loan does not satisfy the requirements of subpart F of this part;

        (2) The Direct Guarantee Lender or Sponsored Entity committed fraud or a material misrepresentation; or

        (3) The Direct Guarantee Lender or Sponsored Entity had known or should have known of fraud or a material misrepresentation in violation of this part, such that the Loan should not have been approved by the Direct Guarantee Lender;

        § 1005.529   Indemnification.

#### § § 1005.529

        (a) When HUD conducts a pre- or post-endorsement review and HUD determines there is an underwriting deficiency where the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan should not have been approved, HUD may request the originating Direct Guarantee Lender to indemnify HUD.

        (c) HUD will notify the originating Direct Guarantee Lender in writing when an indemnification is required.

#### § § 1005.713

        A Section 184 Guaranteed Loan shall contain a due-on-sale clause permitting acceleration, as prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance. The Servicer shall promptly advise HUD of any prohibited sale or other transfer of the property or leasehold interest that occurs. The Servicer must request approval from HUD to accelerate the Loan when any prohibited sale or transfer occurs.

        § 1005.717   Administering escrow accounts.

#### § § 1005.717

        (a) The Servicer shall not use escrow funds for any purpose other than that for which they were received. It shall segregate escrow commitment deposits, work completion deposits, and all periodic payments received on account of leasehold rents, taxes, assessments, monthly payments of Annual Loan Guarantee Fee, and insurance charges or premiums, and shall deposit such funds with one or more financial institutions in a special account or accounts that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration. Leasehold rents on Trust Lands may require additional escrow segregation by Servicers, as may be prescribed in Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (b) It is the Servicer's responsibility to ensure timely escrow disbursements and their proper application. Servicers must establish controls to ensure that accounts payable from the escrow account or the information needed to pay such accounts payable is obtained on a timely basis. Penalties for late payments for accounts payable from the escrow account must not be charged to the Borrower or HUD unless the Servicer can show that the penalty was the direct result of the Borrower's error or omission. The Servicer shall further comply with applicable Tribal, Federal, or State laws, including method of calculations related to escrow, the methods of collection and accounting, and the payment of the accounts payable for which the money has been escrowed.

        (c) The Servicer shall not initiate foreclosure for escrow account shortfalls resulting from advances made pursuant to this section.

        (d) When a Loan Guarantee Certificate is terminated voluntarily or due to Borrower's prepayment, in total satisfaction of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, amounts in the escrow account designated to pay any HUD required program fees shall be remitted to HUD in a form approved by HUD at the time of the required reporting related to the voluntary termination or prepayment. When a Section 184 Guaranteed Loan is prepaid in full, amounts held in escrow for taxes, hazard insurance, or rents, if applicable, that are not yet due or incurred, shall be released to the Borrower.

        § 1005.719   Fees and costs after endorsement.

#### § § 1005.719

        (a) After endorsement, the Servicer may collect reasonable and customary fees and costs from the Borrower only as provided below. The Servicer may collect these fees or costs from the Borrower only to the extent that the Servicer is not reimbursed for such fees or costs by HUD. Permissible fees and costs include:

        (1) Late fee in accordance with § 1005.511;

        (2) Costs for processing or reprocessing a check returned as uncollectible (where bank policy permits, the Servicer must deposit a check for collection a second time before assessing an insufficient funds charge);

        (3) Fees for processing a change of ownership of the property;

        (4) Fees and costs for processing an assumption of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan in connection with the sale or transfer of the property;

        (5) Costs for processing a request for credit approval incurred in the course of processing an assumption or substitute Borrower;

        (6) Costs for substitution of a hazard insurance policy at other than the expiration of term of the existing hazard insurance policy;

        (8) Fees and costs for processing a partial release of the property;

        (9) Attorney's and trustee's fees and costs actually incurred (including the cost of appraisals and advertising) when a Section 184 Guaranteed Loan has been referred to foreclosure counsel and subsequently the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan is reinstated. No attorney's fee and cost that exceeds the reasonable limits prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance may be collected from the Borrower, unless approved by HUD;

        (10) A trustee's fee, if the security instrument provides for payment of such a fee, for execution of a satisfactory release when the deed of trust is paid in full;

        (11) Where permitted by the security instrument, attorney's fees and costs actually incurred in the defense of any suit or legal proceeding wherein the Servicer shall be made a party thereto by reason of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan. No attorney's fee may be charged for the services of the Servicer's staff attorney or other employee;

        (12) property preservation costs incurred, subject to reasonable limits prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance, or otherwise approved by HUD;

        (13) Fees permitted for providing a beneficiary notice under applicable Tribal, Federal and/or State law, if such a fee is not otherwise prohibited by the applicable law(s); and

        (14) Such other reasonable and customary costs as may be authorized by HUD.

        (b) Reasonable and customary fees must be based upon the actual cost of the work performed, including out-of-pocket expenses. HUD may establish maximum fees and costs which are reasonable and customary in different geographic areas. Except as provided in this part, no fee or costs shall be based on a percentage of either the face amount of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan or the unpaid principal balance due.

        § 1005.721   Enforcement of late fees.

#### § § 1005.721

        (a) A Servicer shall not commence foreclosure when the Borrower's only default is his or her failure to pay a late fee(s).

        (b) A late fee that may be assessed under the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan but unpaid by the Borrower shall not justify Servicer's return of Borrower's payment. However, if the Servicer thereafter notifies the Borrower of his obligation to pay a late fee, such a fee may be deducted from any subsequent payment or payments submitted by the Borrower or on his behalf if this is not inconsistent with the terms of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan. Partial Payments shall be treated as provided in § 1005.723.

        (c) A payment submission may be returned because of failure to include a late fee only if the Servicer notifies the Borrower before imposition of the charge of the amount of the monthly payment, the date when the late fee will be imposed, and either the amount of the late charge or the total amount due when the late fee is included.

        (d) During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the Servicing of a Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, a late fee shall not be assessed. If a payment is received by the prior Servicer on or before the due date (including any applicable grace period allowed by the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan), no late fees shall be assessed by the new Servicer.

        (e) A Servicer shall not assess a late fee for failure to pay a late fee, as prohibited under 12 CFR 1026.36.

        § 1005.723   Partial Payments.

#### § § 1005.723

        (a) A Servicer must have a written policy on how it handles Partial Payments, in compliance with this section and that policy shall be readily available to the public.

        (b) Upon receipt of a Partial Payment, a Servicer must provide the Borrower a copy of the Servicer's written Partial Payment policy and a letter explaining how it will handle the received Partial Payment. The Servicer may:

        (1) Accept a Partial Payment and either apply it to the Borrower's account;

        (2) Identify it with the Borrower's account number and hold it in a trust account pending disposition; or

        (3) Return the Partial Payment(s) to the Borrower.

        § 1005.725   Handling prepayments.

#### § § 1005.725

        Notwithstanding the terms of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, the Servicer shall accept a prepayment at any time and in any amount. Monthly interest on the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan must be calculated on the actual unpaid principal balance of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan as of the date the prepayment is received, and not as of the next payment due date.

        § 1005.727   Substitute Borrowers.

#### § § 1005.727

        Where an original Borrower requests the substitution of an existing Borrower on the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan:

        (a) A Servicer who is Non-Direct Guarantee Lender or financial institution must obtain HUD approval for the substitution. A remaining original Borrower must be maintained and continue to be personally liable for the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, notwithstanding any discharge entered in accordance with applicable Tribal, Federal, or State law.

        (b) A Servicer who is a Direct Guarantee Lender may, subject to limitations established by HUD, approve an eligible substitute Borrower that meets the requirements for Section 184 Guaranteed Loans which they own or service, without specific approval from HUD. The remaining original Borrower must be maintained and continue to be personally liable for the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan, notwithstanding any discharge entered in accordance with applicable Tribal, Federal, or State law.

      Servicing Default Section 184 Guaranteed Loans

        § 1005.729   Section 184 Guaranteed Loan collection action.

#### § § 1005.729

        A Servicer shall take prompt action to collect amounts due from Borrowers to minimize the number of accounts in default status. The Servicer must exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection, including assessing the Borrower's financial circumstances for loss mitigation options in accordance with § 1005.739. No Servicer shall commence foreclosure, assign the loan to HUD, or acquire title to a property until the requirements of this subpart have been completed.

        § 1005.731   Default notice to Borrower.

#### § § 1005.731

        (1) Acknowledge receipt of the application;

        (2) Determine if the application is complete or incomplete;

        (3) If incomplete, notify the Borrower which documentation is required and missing, and that submission of the missing documents is required no later than fourteen days from the date of the response to provide missing documents to the Servicer. If the Borrower does not timely submit the requested documents, the Servicer must initiate live contact with the Borrower.

        (b)  Within fourteen days of receipt of a complete application from Borrower, the Servicer must evaluate the application.

        (c)  The Servicer shall provide written notification:

        (1) Informing the Borrower of all available loss mitigation options;

        (2) Encouraging the Borrower to review all available loss mitigation options and to contact the Servicer with any questions;

        (3) Encouraging Borrowers, when feasible, to consider pursuing simultaneous loss mitigation options, to the extent it is offered by the Servicer;

        (4) Informing the Borrower that if no loss mitigation option is elected or if all elected loss mitigation options fail, the Servicer may proceed with Tribal notice under § 1005.757(a) or First Legal Action at 180 days of default in accordance with § 1005.757 or § 1005.761; and

        (5) Informing the Borrower that, upon First Legal Action or the assignment of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan to HUD, the Servicer may no longer offer or authorize a pre-foreclosure sale as an alternative to foreclosure, and that the primary alternative to foreclosure shall be a deed-in-lieu/lease-in-lieu of foreclosure, subject to applicable Tribal, Federal, or State law or contractual requirements. HUD may permit other loss mitigation on a case-by-case basis if requested by the Servicer.

        (d)  (1) If, after the Borrower receives the Servicer's loss mitigation options, the Borrower disagrees with Servicer's loss mitigation determination, the Borrower may appeal in writing and request that the Servicer re-evaluate the Borrower's loss mitigation application. The Borrower must submit its appeal no later than 14 days from the date of notification of the Servicer's loss mitigation determination, or any other deadline as may be prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance. Upon receipt of the Borrower's appeal of the Servicer's loss mitigation determination, the Servicer shall re-evaluate the Borrower's loss mitigation application within thirty days but may not use the same staff that made the initial loss mitigation determination and shall notify the Borrower of its appeal decision in writing.

        (2) If the Borrower submits a timely written appeal, the 180-day deadline for First Legal Action shall be suspended during the appeal process.

        § 1005.735   Occupancy inspection.

#### § § 1005.735

        (a)  An occupancy inspection is a visual inspection of a Section 184 Guaranteed Loan property by the Servicer to determine if the property is vacant or abandoned and to confirm the identity of any occupants.

        (b)  An occupancy follow-up is an attempt to communicate with the Borrower via letter, telephone, or other method of communication, other than on-site inspection, to determine occupancy when the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan remains in default after the initial occupancy inspection that did not result in determination of the Borrower's occupancy status.

        (c)  The Servicer must perform the initial occupancy inspection after the 45th day of default but no later than the 60th day of the default when:

        (1) A payment has not been received within 45 days of the due date or for any other defaults under the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan; and

        (2) Efforts to reach the Borrower or occupant have been unsuccessful.

        (d)  If the Servicer is unable to determine the Borrower's occupancy status through the initial occupancy inspection, the Servicer must perform occupancy follow-ups and, if necessary, occupancy inspections every 25-35 days from the last inspection until the occupancy status is determined.

        (e)  When payments are not submitted and a Borrower is a debtor in bankruptcy, the Servicer must contact either the bankruptcy trustee or the Borrower's bankruptcy attorney, if the Borrower is represented, for information concerning the occupancy status of the property or if an occupancy inspection is necessary or requires authorization. If the Servicer cannot determine that the property is vacant or abandoned during the period of the automatic stay, the Servicer must document in the servicing case binder with evidence that it timely contacted the attorney or trustee.

        (f)  Servicers must make an initial contact with the Tribe in advance of any occupancy inspection on Trust Land to review the Tribe's protocol for conducting occupancy inspections. After the initial contact, Servicers must contact the Tribe in advance of an occupancy inspection on Trust Land in accordance with the Tribe's protocol.

        (g)  HUD may prescribe alternative extended deadlines to the requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section through Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (h)  Nothing in this section shall require a Servicer to conduct an inspection when prohibited by applicable Tribal, Federal, State, or local law.

        § 1005.737   Vacant or abandoned property procedures.

#### § § 1005.737

        If the Servicer determines through an occupancy inspection or occupancy follow-up that the property is vacant or abandoned, or if the Servicer is notified by HUD that the Tribe or the TDHE determined the property is vacant or abandoned, the Servicer must send a letter, via certified mail or other method providing delivery confirmation, to all Borrowers at the property address, or other known address of Borrower, informing them of the Servicer's determination that the property is vacant or abandoned. This letter must include the Servicer's contact information.

        (a) If occupancy is verified through the delivery confirmation, the Servicer shall continue pursuing collection efforts and loss mitigation as required by §§ 1005.729 and 1005.739 until the Servicer has the authority to proceed to First Legal Action in accordance with § 1005.763 or Tribal First Right of Refusal in accordance with § 1005.759.

        (1) Commence first-time vacant property inspection;

        (2) Take appropriate property preservation and protection actions to secure and maintain the property;

        (3) For properties on Trust Land:

        (i) Notify the Tribe that the property is vacant or abandoned; and

        (ii) Complete Tribal First Right of Refusal under § 1005.759;

        (4) For fee simple Properties, complete First Legal Action within 30 days;

        (5) Continue to perform vacant property inspections every 25-35 days until the default is cured, the property is disposed of, or the bankruptcy court has granted approval for the Servicer to contact the Borrower or to take any required property preservation actions; and

        (6) Retain documentation in the servicing case binder providing evidence of activities required by HUD in this section or otherwise provided in Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (c)  HUD may prescribe alternative extended deadlines to the time requirements of this section in Section 184 Program Guidance.

        (e) HUD may prescribe conditions and requirements in Section 184 Program Guidance for the eligibility and appropriate use of loss mitigation options.

        (f) Within 180 days of default, or any extended timeframe prescribed by Section 184 Guidance, if the Borrower fails to meet their loss mitigation option requirements, the Servicer shall have up to 45 days from the date of the failure of the loss mitigation to determine whether the Borrower should continue with the current loss mitigation option or have Borrower enter into an alternate loss mitigation option.

        (g) If a Borrower does not accept, is not eligible for, or fails loss mitigation, the Servicer shall complete First Legal Action in accordance with § 1005.763 or Tribal First Right of Refusal in accordance with § 1005.759.

        (a)  If the Borrower is a person in “military service,” as such term is defined in the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 3901-4043), the Servicer may, by written agreement with the Borrower, postpone for the period of military service and three months thereafter any part of the monthly payment which represents the Amortization of principal.

        (b)  Forbearance plans may be available to Borrowers in military service pursuant to § 1005.745(e).

        (c)  If at any time during default the Borrower is a person in “military service,” as such term is defined in the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the period during which the Borrower is in such military service shall be excluded in computing the period within which the Servicer shall complete First Legal Action to acquire the property or Tribal notice under § 1005.759(a). No postponement or delay in the prosecution of foreclosure proceedings during the period the Borrower is in such military service shall be construed as failure on the part of the Servicer to exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting such proceedings to completion as required by this subpart.

        § 1005.745   Forbearance plans.

#### § § 1005.745

        (a)  Forbearance plans are arrangements between a Servicer and Borrower that may allow for a period of reduced and/or suspended payments and specific terms for the repayment plan. During the Forbearance period, where Borrower is in compliance with the Forbearance plan, the Servicer shall not proceed to First Legal Action or complete Tribal First Right of Refusal notice under § 1005.759 until expiration or default of the Agreement.

        (b)  Informal forbearance plans are oral agreements, where permitted under Tribal or State law, between a Servicer and Borrower allowing for reduced or suspended payments and may provide specific terms for repayment.

        (2)  The period shall be three months or less.

        (c)  Formal forbearance plans are written agreements executed by the Servicer and Borrower, allowing for reduced or suspended payments and such plans may include specific terms for repayment.

        (1)  The Servicer may offer a formal forbearance plan when:

        (2)  The Servicer shall execute a written agreement with the Borrower outlining the terms and conditions of the formal forbearance. The Servicer must include in the formal forbearance agreement a provision for the resumption of monthly payments on a date certain, with repayment in amounts which will completely reinstate the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan no later than the original maturity date.

        (ii) The Servicer receives notice from local government or other third parties regarding property condition; or

        (iii) The property may be affected by a disaster event.

        (iv) If significant maintenance costs contributed to the default or are affecting the Borrower's ability to make payments under the loan or formal forbearance agreement, the Servicer may provide in the formal forbearance agreement a period of loan forbearance during which repairs specified in the agreement will be completed at the Borrower's expense.

        (d)  The special forbearance-unemployment loss mitigation option is available when one or more of the Borrowers has become unemployed and the loss of employment has negatively affected the Borrower's ability to continue to make their monthly Section 184 Guaranteed Loan payment.

        (1)  The Servicer must ensure that the Borrower meets all the following eligibility requirements:

        (i) The Section 184 Guaranteed Loan must be at least three months in default.

        (ii) The Borrower is experiencing a verified loss of income or increase in living expenses due to loss of employment.

        (iii) The Borrower must continue to occupy the property as a Principal Residence.

The Servicer must retain this documentation in the servicing case binder.

        (5)  The Servicer must conduct any review it deems necessary, including a property inspection, when the Servicer has reason to believe that the physical condition of the property adversely impacts the Borrower's use or ability to support the debt as follows:

        (i) Financial information provided by the Borrower indicating large expenses for property maintenance;

        (ii) The Servicer receives notice from local government or other third parties regarding property condition; or

        (2)  The addendum shall be in the form prescribed by Section 184 Program Guidance. The pre-foreclosure sale addendum must be fully executed at closing.

        (h)  Documents listed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section must be sent to the Borrower via methods providing delivery confirmation with a date and time stamp of delivery.

When the Servicer becomes aware that the property has sustained damage after a Borrower has received the Approval to Participate Agreement, the Servicer must evaluate the property to determine if it continues to qualify for the pre-foreclosure sale program or terminate participation if the extent of the damage changes the property's fair market value.

        (p)  Where applicable, the Servicer must work with the Borrower to file a hazard insurance claim and either: use the proceeds to repair the property; or adjust the Claim by the amount of the insurance settlement (Non-Surchargeable Damage) or the Secretary's repair cost estimate.

#### § § 1006.310

      (a)  The DHHL must develop and follow written policies governing rents for rental housing units assisted with NHHBG funds, including methods by which rents are determined.

      (1)  The maximum monthly tenant rent payment for a low-income family may not exceed 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income. DHHL may also decide to compute rental or homebuyer payments on any lesser percentage of the adjusted income of the family. The Act does not set minimum rent or homebuyer payments; however, DHHL may do so.

      (2)  Flat rent means the tenant's rent payment is set at a specific dollar amount or specific percent of market rent. Income-adjusted rent means the tenant's rent payment varies based on the tenant's income ( 30 percent of monthly adjusted income). DHHL may charge flat or income-adjusted rents, provided the rental or homebuyer payment of the low-income family does not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted income.

      (3)  Utilities may be considered a part of rent or homebuyer payments if DHHL decides to define rent or homebuyer payments to include utilities in its written policies on rents and homebuyer payments required by section 811(a)(1) of NAHASDA. DHHL may define rents and homebuyer payments to exclude utilities.

      (b)  If DHHL assists low-income families to become homeowners of rental housing through a long-term lease ( 10 or more years) with an option to purchase the housing, DHHL must develop and follow written policies governing lease-purchase payments ( homebuyer payments) for rental housing units assisted with NHHBG funds, including methods by which payments are determined. The maximum monthly payment for a low-income family may not exceed 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.

      (c)  Homeownership payments for families who are not low-income, as permitted under § 1006.301(b), are not subject to the requirement that homebuyer payments may not exceed 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of that family.

      (d)  Low-income families who receive homeownership assistance other than lease-purchase assistance are not subject to the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

#### § § 1006.320

      As a condition to receiving grant amounts under the Act, the DHHL must adopt and use written tenant and homebuyer selection policies and criteria that:

      (a) Are consistent with the purpose of providing housing for low-income families;

      (a)  As a condition to receiving NHHBG funds, the DHHL must require adequate insurance coverage for housing units that are owned or operated or assisted with more than $5,000 of NHHBG funds, including a loan of more than $5,000 that includes payback provisions.

      (b)  Insurance is adequate if it is a purchased insurance policy from an insurance provider or a plan of self-insurance in an amount to cover replacement cost.

      (c)  The DHHL must provide for or require insurance in adequate amounts to indemnify against loss from fire, weather, and liability claims for all housing units owned, operated or assisted by the DHHL. NHHBG funds may only be used to purchase insurance for low-income homeowners and only in amounts sufficient to protect against the loss of the NHHBG funds at risk in the property. The cost of such insurance may not include coverage for a resident's personal property.

      (d)  The DHHL shall not require insurance if the assistance is in an amount less than $5000.

      (e)  The DHHL shall require contractors and subcontractors to either provide insurance covering their activities or negotiate adequate indemnification coverage to be provided by the DHHL in the contract.

      § 1006.335   Use of nonprofit organizations and public-private partnerships.

#### § § 1006.335

      § 1006.340   Treatment of program income.

#### § § 1006.340

      (a)  Program income is income realized from the use of NHHBG funds. If gross income is used to pay costs incurred that are essential or incidental to generating the income, these costs may be deducted from gross income to determine program income. Program income includes income from fees for services performed; from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired or assisted with NHHBG funds; from the sale of property acquired or assisted with NHHBG funds; from payments of principal and interest on loans made with NHHBG funds; and from payments of interest earned on investment of NHHBG funds pursuant to section 812(b) of the Act.

      (b)  The DHHL may retain any program income that is realized from any NHHBG funds if:

      (1) That income was realized after the initial disbursement of the NHHBG funds received by the DHHL; and

      (2) The DHHL agrees to use the program income for affordable housing activities in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this part; and

      (3) The DHHL disburses program income before disbursing additional NHHBG funds in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305.

      (c)  If the amount of income received in a single fiscal year by the DHHL, which would otherwise be considered program income, does not exceed $25,000, such funds may be retained but will not be considered program income.

#### § § 1006.345

      (a)  (1) As described in section 805(b) of the Act, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under this part must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a-276a-5) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.

      (2) When NHHBG assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NHHBG assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.

      (3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.

      (b)  Section 805(b) of the Act also mandates that contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under the Act require that prevailing wages determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable State or local law) by HUD shall be paid to maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, and to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development, of affordable housing.

      (c)  Contracts in excess of $100,000 to which Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply are subject by law to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327).

      (d)  The requirements in 24 CFR part 70 concerning exemptions for the use of volunteers on projects subject to Davis-Bacon and HUD-determined wage rates are applicable.

      § 1006.350   Environmental review.

#### § § 1006.350

      (a) In order to ensure that the policies of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 ) (NEPA) and other provisions of Federal law which further the purposes of that act (as specified in 24 CFR 58.5) are most effectively implemented in connection with the expenditure of NHHBG funds, HUD will provide for the release of funds for specific projects to the DHHL if the Director of the DHHL assumes all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making, and action under NEPA and other provisions of Federal law which further the purposes of that act (as specified in 24 CFR 58.5) that would apply to HUD were HUD to undertake those projects as Federal projects.

      (b) An environmental review does not have to be completed before a HUD finding of compliance for the housing plan or amendments to the housing plan submitted by the DHHL.

      (c) No funds may be committed to a grant activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification required by sections 806(b) and 806(c) of the Act, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58.

      (d) As set forth in section 806(a)(2)(B) of the Act and 24 CFR 58.77, HUD will:

      (1) Provide for the monitoring of environmental reviews performed by the DHHL under this section;

      (2) At its discretion, facilitate training for the performance of such reviews by the DHHL; and,

      (3) At its discretion, provide for the suspension or termination of the assumption of responsibilities under this section based upon a finding of substantial failure of the DHHL to execute responsibilities under this section.

      § 1006.377   Other Federal requirements: Displacement, Relocation, and Acquisition.

#### § § 1006.377

      The following relocation and real property acquisition policies are applicable to programs developed or operated under the Act and this part:

      (a)  The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4601 ) (URA) and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.

      (b)  Consistent with the other goals and objectives of the Act and this part, the DHHL shall assure that it has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under the Act and this part.

      (c)  A displaced person (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 ). Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable and suitable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. For a displaced person with a disability, a unit is not a comparable replacement dwelling under the URA unless it is free of any barriers which would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such a displaced person in accordance with the definition of “Decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling” at 49 CFR 24.2. Furthermore, the unit must also meet the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) as implemented by HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 8, subpart C.

      (d)  A person who disagrees with the DHHL's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the DHHL in accordance with URA requirements of 49 CFR 24.10.

      (e)  (1) The DHHL shall certify that it will comply with the URA requirements of 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The DHHL shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the DHHL to comply with the provisions in this section.

      (2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the DHHL from any other source.

      (3) DHHL must provide proper and timely distribution of notices to residents in accordance with the URA regulations. This includes the General Information Notice (GIN), the Notice of Relocation Eligibility, the Notice to Owner, and the 90-Day Notice. All notices must be sent in accordance with 49 CFR 24.203 and 24.102. Notices of Relocation Eligibility are typically triggered by the Initiation of Negotiation (ION).

      (4) The DHHL shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.

      (f)  (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under the Act. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:

      (i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of a housing plan that is later approved;

      (ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date the housing plan is submitted to HUD, that the DHHL determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project;

      (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after execution of the agreement between the DHHL and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

      (A) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or

      (B) Thirty percent of gross household income.

      (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if:

      (A) The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses;

      (B) The tenant-occupant is required to temporarily relocate for more than one year; or

      (C) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.

      (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:

      (A) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

      (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section for the definition of “Displaced Person,” a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

      (i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the housing plan to HUD, but before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person ( the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;

      (ii) The person meets the definition of “persons not displaced” as defined in 49 CFR 24.2; or

      (iii) The DHHL determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination in accordance with 49 CFR 24.2.

      (3) The DHHL may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.

      (g)  For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced from a dwelling as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of the real property, the term Initiation of Negotiations (ION) date means the execution of the written agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition ( 49 CFR 24.2).

    § 1007.25   Eligible lenders.

#### § § 1007.25

    (a)  To qualify for a guarantee under this part, a loan shall be made only by a lender meeting qualifications established in this part and approved by HUD, including any lender described in paragraph (b), of this section, except that a loan otherwise insured or guaranteed by an agency of the Federal Government or made by the DHHL from amounts borrowed from the United States shall not be eligible for a guarantee under this part.

    (b)  The following lenders shall be considered to be lenders that have been approved by HUD:

    (1) Any mortgagee approved by HUD for participation in the single family mortgage insurance program under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.A. 1707 );

#### § § 1007.30

    (a)  A loan guaranteed under section 184A of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and this part may be secured by any collateral authorized under and not prohibited by Federal or State law and determined by the lender and approved by HUD to be sufficient to cover the amount of the loan. Eligible collateral may include, but is not limited to, the following:

    (1) The property and/or improvements to be acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated, to the extent that an interest in such property is not subject to any restrictions against alienation applicable to Hawaiian Home Lands;

    (2) A security interest in non-Hawaiian Home Lands property;

    (3) Personal property; or

    (4) Cash, notes, an interest in securities, royalties, annuities, or any other property that is transferable and whose present value may be determined.

    (1)  Any land lease for a unit financed under section 184A of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 must be on a form approved by both the DHHL and HUD.

    (2)  The lease form must contain a provision requiring the DHHL's consent before any assumption of an existing lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by HUD through foreclosure of the guaranteed mortgage or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A mortgagee other than HUD must obtain the DHHL's consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. The DHHL's consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including HUD, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is guaranteed or held by HUD.

    (3)  The lender or HUD shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to another eligible Native Hawaiian family or the DHHL. The lender or HUD shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to another eligible Native Hawaiian family or the DHHL.

    (4)  Before HUD will guarantee a loan secured by a Hawaiian Home Lands property, the DHHL must notify HUD that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the guaranteed loan has been foreclosed.

    (i)  If HUD determines that the DHHL has failed to enforce adequately its eviction procedures, HUD will cease issuing guarantees for loans under this part except pursuant to existing commitments.

    (ii)  If HUD ceases issuing guarantees for the DHHL's failure to enforce its eviction procedures, HUD shall notify the DHHL of such action and that the DHHL may, within 30 days after notification of HUD's action, file a written appeal with the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Native American Programs (ONAP). Upon notification of an adverse decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the DHHL has 30 additional days to file an appeal with the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, but the DHHL may resubmit the issue to the Assistant Secretary for review at any subsequent time if new evidence or changed circumstances warrant reconsideration.

    (a) Be made for a term not exceeding 30 years;

    (b) Bear interest (exclusive of the guarantee fee under § 1007.55 and service charges, if any) at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender and determined by HUD to be reasonable, but not to exceed the rate generally charged in the area (as determined by HUD) for home mortgage loans not guaranteed or insured by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;

    (c) Involve a principal obligation not exceeding:

    (1) 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property as of the date the loan is accepted for guarantee (or 98.75 percent if the value of the property is $50,000 or less); or

If the loan involves proposed or new construction, HUD will require compliance with procedures similar to those required by § 203.12(b)(2) of this title for FHA mortgage insurance.

    § 1007.45   Nondiscrimination.

#### § § 1007.45

    (a) To the extent that the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d ) or of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C.A. 3601 ) apply to a guarantee provided under this part, nothing in the requirements concerning discrimination on the basis of race shall be construed to prevent the provision of the guarantee to an eligible entity on the basis that the entity serves Native Hawaiian families or is a Native Hawaiian family.

    § 1007.70   Disqualification of lenders and civil money penalties.

#### § § 1007.70

    (a) —(1)  HUD may take action under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if HUD determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate:

    (ii) Bar such lender or holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under this part; and

    (iii) Require that such lender or holder assume not less than 10 percent of any loss on further loans made or held by the lender or holder that are guaranteed under this part.

    (i)  The holder of the certificate may initiate foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of that action to HUD). Upon a final order by the court authorizing foreclosure and submission to HUD of a claim for payment under the guarantee, HUD will pay to the holder of the certificate the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under § 1007.60) plus reasonable fees and expenses as approved by HUD. HUD's rights will be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee, who shall assign the obligation and security to HUD.

    (ii)  Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to HUD a request to assign the obligation and security interest to HUD in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. HUD may accept assignment of the loan if HUD determines that the assignment is in the best interest of the United States. Upon assignment, HUD will pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under § 1007.60). HUD's rights will be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee, who shall assign the obligation and security to HUD.

Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. HUD will then take such action to collect as HUD determines to be appropriate.
