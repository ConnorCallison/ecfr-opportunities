  PART 600—THE UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS

### Part 600

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 22 U.S.C 2651a, 22 U.S.C. 2151, 22 U.S.C. 2451, 22 U.S.C. 1461, 2 CFR part 200.

**Source:** Source: 79 FR 76019, Dec. 19, 2014, unless otherwise noted.

    § 600.101   Applicability.

#### § § 600.101

    Under the authority listed above, the Department of State adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except for:

    (a) The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards set forth in 2 CFR part 200 (Subparts A through F) shall apply to all non-Federal entities, except as noted below.

    (b) Subparts A through E of 2 CFR part 200 shall apply to all foreign organizations not recognized as Foreign Public Entities and Subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200 shall apply to all U.S. and foreign for-profit entities, except where the Federal awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statute or regulations of a foreign government. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 30, Cost Accounting Standards, and Part 31 Contract Cost Principles and Procedures takes precedence over the cost principles in Subpart E for Federal awards to U.S. and foreign for-profit entities. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department.

    § 600.205   Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.

#### § § 600.205

    Use of 2 CFR 200.205 (the DOS review of risk posed by applicants) is required for all selected competitive and non-competitive awards.

    § 600.315   Intangible property.

#### § § 600.315

    If the DOS obtains research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the DOS may charge the requester fees consistent with the FOIA and applicable DOS regulations and policies.

    § 600.407   Prior written approval (prior approval).

#### § § 600.407

    The non-Federal entity must seek the prior written approval for indirect or special or unusual costs prior to incurring such costs where DOS is the cognizant agency.

  PART 601—NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

This extends the coverage of the DOS nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180).
