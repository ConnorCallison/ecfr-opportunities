## Subchapter A

    PART 300-1—THE FEDERAL TRAVEL REGULATION (FTR)

### Part 300

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5707; 5 U.S.C. 5738; 5 U.S.C. 5741-5742; 20 U.S.C. 905(a); 31 U.S.C. 1353; 40 U.S.C. 121(c); 49 U.S.C. 40118; E.O. 11609, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 586.

**Source:** Source: FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15951, Apr. 1, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

      § 300-1.1   What is the FTR?

#### § § 300-1.1

      The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapters 300 through 304, which implements statutory requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by Federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at Government expense.

      § 300-1.2   What is the purpose of the FTR?

#### § § 300-1.2

      There are two principal purposes:

      (a) To interpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner that balances the need to assure that official travel is conducted in a responsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs;

      (b) To communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to Federal agencies and employees.

    PART 300-2—HOW TO USE THE FTR

### Part 300

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5707; 5 U.S.C. 5738; 5 U.S.C. 5741-5742; 20 U.S.C. 905(a); 31 U.S.C. 1353; 40 U.S.C. 121(c); 49 U.S.C. 40118; E.O. 11609, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 586.

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 89502, Nov. 13, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

      § 300-2.1   How is the FTR formatted?

#### § § 300-2.1

      The FTR is written in a question and answer (Q&A) format, which is an effective way to engage the reader and present the information in digestible pieces.

      § 300-2.2   How are the rules in this part expressed in the Q&A format?

#### § § 300-2.2

      The rules in this part are expressed in both the question and answer.

      § 300-2.3   Who is subject to the FTR?

#### § § 300-2.3

      As to executive agencies (see § 300-3.1 of this chapter), civilian employees of an executive agency, and the executive agency itself, are subject to the FTR. Since the user may be an employee or an agency, portions of the FTR have been separated into employee and agency sections. However, while the employee provisions are addressed to the employee, the rules expressed in those provisions apply to the agency as well. The following lists the relevant employee and agency sections of the FTR:

      § 300-2.4   How is the user addressed in the FTR?

#### § § 300-2.4

      The FTR asks questions in the first person, as the user would. It then answers the questions in the second and third person. In the employee sections, the employee is addressed in the singular, and in the agency sections, the agency is addressed in the plural. The following describes how employee and agency are addressed in both sections:

    PART 300-3—GLOSSARY OF TERMS

### Part 300

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5707; 40 U.S.C. 121(c); 49 U.S.C. 40118; 5 U.S.C. 5738; 5 U.S.C. 5741-5742; 20 U.S.C. 905(a); 31 U.S.C. 1353; E.O 11609, as amended, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 586, Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-126, revised May 22, 1992.

      § 300-3.1   What do the following terms mean?

#### § § 300-3.1

      —Government property and personal property of the traveler necessary for official travel.

      —Payment of authorized actual expenses incurred, up to the limit prescribed by the Administrator of GSA or agency, as appropriate. Entitlement to reimbursement is contingent upon entitlement to per diem, and is subject to the same definitions and rules governing per diem.

      —For purposes of chapter 302  means:

      (1) An executive agency as defined in Title 5 U.S.C. 105 (an executive department, an independent establishment, the Government Accountability Office, or a wholly owned Government corporation as defined in section 101 of the Government Corporation Control Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. 9101), but excluding a Government controlled corporation);

      (2) A military department;

      (3) A court of the United States;

      (4) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts;

      (5) The Federal Judicial Center;

      (6) The Library of Congress;

      (7) The United States Botanic Garden;

      (8) The Government Printing Office; and

      (9) The District of Columbia.

      —An agency component that has management control of Federal aircraft used by the agency or of aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS).

      —Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee receives a bona fide offer from a qualified buyer before the employee has accepted an appraised value offer from the relocation services company (RSC). The RSC amends its offer to match the outside sale price. An amended value sale is different from an amended from zero sale because an amended value sale occurs after an appraised value offer while an amended from zero sale occurs before an appraised value offer.

      —Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee accepts the offer from the RSC to buy the employee's home based upon the average of a specific number of appraisals conducted by designated certified appraisers.

      —Any place of public lodging that is listed on the national master list of approved accommodations. The national master list of all approved accommodations is compiled, periodically updated, and published in the  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Additionally, the approved accommodation list is available on the U.S. Fire Administration's internet site at .

      —Government contractor-provided ATM services that allow cash withdrawals from participating ATMs to be charged to a Government contractor-issued charge card.

      —Type of home sale program with procedures the same as the amended value program, except that the RSC does not initially appraise the employee's home or make a guaranteed buy-out offer. The buy-out offer from the contractor is based on a bona fide offer received by the employee from a qualified buyer after marketing by the employee. Once a bona fide offer is received by the employee, the contractor offers to buy the home from the employee at a price based on the outside sale price.

      —The class of accommodation that is normally the lowest class of fare offered by common carriers regardless of terminology used. For reference purposes only, coach class may also be referred to as tourist class, economy class, steerage, or standard class.

      —Under commercial air transportation seating upgrade programs, a passenger may obtain a preferable seat choice or increased amenities or services within the coach class seating area. These upgraded choices are generally available for a fee, as a program membership benefit (such as frequent flyer) or at an airport kiosk or gate. Coach class seating upgrade options are not considered a new or higher class of accommodation from coach as the seat is lower than other than coach class accommodations in terms of cost and amenities ( seating girth and pitch, priority boarding, luggage allowance, expedited food/drink service).

      —Commercial aviation services (CAS) include, for the exclusive use of an executive agency—

      (1) Leased aircraft;

      (2) Chartered or rented aircraft;

      (3) Commercial contracts for full aviation services (, aircraft plus related aviation services) or acquisition of full services through inter-service support agreements (ISSA) with other agencies; or

      (4) Related services (, services but not aircraft) obtained by commercial contract or ISSA, except those services acquired to support Federal aircraft.

      —Private sector supplier of air, rail, bus, ship, or other transit system.

      —A price rate used to calculate a set amount to be paid to an employee for the transportation and temporary storage of their household goods.

      —The 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia.

      —U.S. certificated air carriers which are under contract with the government to furnish Federal employees and other persons authorized to travel at Government expense with passenger transportation service. This also includes GSA's scheduled airline passenger service between selected U.S. cities/airports and between selected U.S. and international cities/airports at reduced fares.

      —A mandatory use (see § 301-10.110 for required users) Government program that provides commercially available scheduled air passenger transportation services to persons authorized to travel directly at the Government's expense. The City Pair Program offers negotiated firm-fixed-price fares on one-way routes between airports that apply in either direction of travel. Fares may be issued using one of the following fare types, or others that the contract City Pair Program may solicit:

      (1)  (_CA)—A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is less expensive than the unrestricted contract City Pair Program coach class fare (YCA), but has limited inventory availability, meaning, once the flight reaches a certain capacity, _CA fares may no longer be available for booking. Unlike YCA fares, _CA fares are restricted by the availability of seats. Accordingly, early booking may increase the likelihood of booking a _CA fare. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.

      (2)  (YCA)—A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is more expensive than a _CA fare, but offers last seat (inventory) availability (unless a flight is already sold out), meaning, as long as coach class inventory is available to sell on the flight, the Government traveler can purchase it.

      (3)  (_CB)—Contract fare offered by carriers in some domestic and international line item markets for business class service. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.

      (8) Are willing to certify, if required by the agency, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that the method for securing such certification, if required, shall be determined by the agency;

      (9) Are willing promptly to disclose, if required by the agency, any dissolution or material change in the status of the domestic partnership; and

      (10) Certify that they would marry but for the failure of their state or other jurisdiction (or foreign country) of residence to permit same-sex marriage.
