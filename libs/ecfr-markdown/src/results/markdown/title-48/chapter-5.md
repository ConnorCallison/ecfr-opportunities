    PART 502—DEFINITIONS OF WORDS AND TERMS

### Part 502

**Authority:** Authority: 40 U.S.C. 121(c).

      Subpart 502.1—Definitions

        502.101   Definitions.

#### § 502.101

        means terms and conditions customarily offered to the public by vendors of supplies or services that meets the definition of “commercial products and commercial services” set forth in FAR 2.101 and intended to create a binding legal obligation on the end user. _Commercial supplier agreements_ are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, including acquisitions of commercial computer software and commercial technical data, but they may apply to any products or service. The term applies—

        (a) Regardless of the format or style of the document. For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be styled as standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service (TOS), End User License Agreement (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of a proposal or quotation responding to a solicitation for a contract or order;

        (b) Regardless of the media or delivery mechanism used. For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be presented as one or more paper documents or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, other product delivery, registration for a service, or another transaction.

        means the agreed upon procedure by which pricing may be adjusted throughout the contract period to include, but not limited to, the mechanism(s) to be used to adjust pricing (e.g., adjustments based on established pricing), the pricing subject to adjustment, and any other requirements (e.g., timing, frequency, limits on increases).

        means an information system used or operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of the U.S. General Services Administration including:

        (1)  means information systems developed using cloud computing. Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( networks, servers, storage, applications) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. _Cloud information system_s include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud information systems may connect to the GSA network.

        (2)  means information systems that reside in contractor facilities and typically do not connect to the GSA network. _External information system_s may be government-owned and contractor-operated or contractor-owned and -operated on behalf of Federal Government (when GSA is the managing agency).

        (3)  means information systems that reside on premise in GSA facilities and may connect to the GSA network. Internal systems are operated on behalf of GSA or the Federal Government (when GSA is the managing agency).

        (4)  means cloud applications that are implemented for a limited duration, considered low impact and would cause limited harm to GSA if breached.

        (5)  means a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer.

        means a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.

        means the material used to protect an item. _Packaging_ includes, but is not limited to: brand packaging, grouped packaging, shipping packaging, ancillary packaging, and redundant packaging.

        (1) Brand packaging, sales packaging or primary packaging means packaging intended to provide the user or consumer with the individual unit of the product, such as plastic casing.

        (2) Grouped packaging or secondary packaging means packaging intended to bundle, sell in bulk, brand, or market/display products.

        (3) Shipping packaging means packaging that serves as protection for the goods to ensure safe transport to the end customer, including:

        (i) Ancillary packaging or transport packaging or tertiary packaging means packaging intended to secure the product, such as packing peanuts, wrapping materials, or molded materials. Ancillary packaging (or all shipping packaging) is typically outside of brand packaging.

        (ii) Redundant packaging or unnecessary packaging means packaging that does not add any measurable protection to the supply being shipped, such as multiple layers of bubble wrap to an already durable product that is encased in a cardboard box. An example of this is a home testing kit with all plastic components already packaged in a cardboard box with cardboard inserts to absorb shock, that is then shipped in multiple layers of bubble wrap. In this example the bubble wrap is the redundant single-use plastic packaging.

        (4) Ancillary packaging or transport packaging or tertiary packaging means packaging intended to secure the product, such as packing peanuts, wrapping materials, or molded materials. Ancillary packaging (or all shipping packaging) is typically outside of brand packaging.

        (5) Redundant packaging or unnecessary packaging means packaging that does not add any measurable protection to the supply being shipped, such as multiple layers of bubble wrap to an already durable product that is encased in a cardboard box. An example of this is a home testing kit with all plastic components already packaged in a cardboard box with cardboard inserts to absorb shock, that is then shipped in multiple layers of bubble wrap. In this example the bubble wrap is the redundant single-use plastic packaging.

        means a synthetic or semisynthetic material chemically synthesized by the polymerization of organic substances that can be shaped into various rigid and flexible forms, and includes coatings and adhesives. “_Plastic_” excludes natural rubber or naturally occurring polymers such as proteins or starches.

        means any plastic used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery, or presentation of goods by a producer for a consumer with the intent of being used once and then discarded, recycled or disposed of immediately after its contents have been used or unpackaged, and typically not refilled or otherwise reused by the producer. Packaging includes, but is not limited to brand packaging, grouped packaging, shipping packaging, ancillary packaging, and redundant packaging.

        means _Single-use plastic (SUP) free packaging_ means product or shipping containment materials free of single-use plastic. Other attributes of single-use plastic free packaging may include the following: use of minimal materials, will be reused multiple times, or produces less emissions compared to traditional manufacturing or distribution. These additional attributes alone do not qualify as SUP free. Examples may include, but are not limited, to corrugated cardboard, paper products, and paper backed tape.

        (2) Initiates proceedings under FAR 3.204(a) by notifying the contractor that GSA is considering action against the contractor for a violation of the Gratuities clause. Notice is sent by a certified letter to the last known address of the party, its counsel, or agent for service of process. In the case of a business, notice is sent to any partner, principal officer, director, owner or co-owner; and

Referrals for fact-finding are not made in cases arising from a conviction or indictment as defined in FAR 9.403. If a referral is made, the fact-finding official takes all the following actions:

        (1) Gives the contractor an opportunity to dispute material facts relating to the determinations under FAR 3.204(a)(1) and (2);

        (2) Conducts proceedings under rules consistent with FAR 3.204(b);

The findings must resolve any material disputes of fact by a preponderance of the evidence.

        (d) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may reject the findings of the fact-finding official only if the findings are clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious.

        (e) In cases arising from conviction or indictment, or in which there are no disputes of material fact, the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, conducts the hearing required by FAR 3.204(b).

        (f) If the Gratuities clause was violated, the contractor may present evidence of mitigating factors to the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, in accordance with FAR 3.204(b) either orally or in writing, consistent with a schedule the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, establishes. The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, exercises the Government's rights under FAR 3.204(c) only after considering mitigating factors.

#### § 504.1103

        In addition to the requirements found in FAR 4.1103, prior to awarding a contractual instrument the contracting officer must—

        (a) Verify that the prospective contractor's legal business name, Doing-Business-As (DBA) name (if any), physical street address, and unique entity identifier, as found in the System for Award Management (SAM), match the information that will be included in the contract, order, or agreement resulting from the vendor's quote or proposal. Correct any mismatches by having the vendor amend the information in the SAM and/or the quote or proposal.

        (b) Ensure that the contractor's address code exists in Pegasys and that it is SAM enabled with the contractor's unique entity identifier number. This can be done by searching Pegasys records using the contractor's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If no code exists, request that a new address code be established by the Finance Center for SAM compliance.

        (c) Ensure that the contractor's identifying information is correctly placed on the contractual instrument, using special care to ensure that the legal name and “remit to” name match exactly. (Note: Lockbox names or numbers should not be used to replace the contractor's name in the remittance block on the contractual instrument.)

        (d) Unless one of the exceptions to registration in SAM applies (see FAR 4.1102(a)), the contracting officer must not award a contract to a prospective contractor who is not registered in SAM. If no exceptions are applicable, and the needs of the requiring activity allows for a delay in award, see FAR 4.1103(b)(1).

#### § 509.405-1

        (a) When a contractor appears as a current exclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM), consider terminating a contract under any of the following circumstances:

        (1) Any circumstances giving rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the contractor's performance of the contract.

        (2) The contractor presents a significant risk to the Government in completing the contract.

        (3) The conduct that provides the cause of the suspension, proposed debarment, or debarment involved a GSA contract.

        (b) Before terminating a contract when a contractor appears as a current exclusion in the SAM, consider the following factors:

        (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension.

        (2) Extent of contract performance.

        (3) Potential costs of termination and reprocurement.

        (4) Need for or urgency of the requirement, contract coverage, and the impact of delay for reprocurement.

        (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's interest until completion of the contract.

        (6) Availability of alternate competitive sources to meet the requirement (e.g., other multiple award contracts, readily available commercial products and commercial services.)

        509.406-3   Procedures.

#### § 509.406-3

        (a)  (1) Refer to the Suspension and Debarment Official matters involving serious contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than one contract may warrant debarment consideration.

        (2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the Suspension and Debarment Official for consideration of debarment action.

        (b)  Include in referrals to the Suspension and Debarment Official a report that contains at least the following:

        (1) The recommendation and supporting rationale.

        (2) A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment, including the contractor, principals, and affiliates. Include last known home and business addresses, zip codes, and unique entity identifiers.

        (3) A statement of facts.

        (4) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of witnesses. Include addresses and telephone numbers. Determine their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and identify the subject matter of their testimony.

        (5) GSA's acquisition history with the contractor. Include recent experience, copies of the pertinent contracts, and an explanation of impact debarment would have on GSA programs. OIG referrals do not require this explanation; the Suspension and Debarment Official will obtain the information directly from the contracting activity(s).

        (6) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Board of Contract Appeals.

        (c)  The Suspension and Debarment Official will review the report, and after coordinating with assigned legal counsel—

        (1) Initiate debarment action;

        (2) Decline debarment action;

        (3) Request additional information; or

        (4) Refer the matter to the OIG for further investigation and development of a case file.

        (d)  (1) The Suspension and Debarment Official will provide:

        (i) Notice of declinations, proposed debarments, and decisions to the referring activity.

        (ii) Notice of proposed debarment to each party being considered for debarment.

        (iii) Decision notices to each party after considering information in the administrative record and information and argument submitted by the affected party or parties.

        (2) A party proposed for debarment:

        (i) Has 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice to respond to the Suspension and Debarment Official or the debarment becomes final.

        (ii) May request and receive a copy of the administrative record that was the basis for the proposed debarment. If information is withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.

        (iii) May request the opportunity to present information and argument in person to the Suspension and Debarment Official. The Suspension and Debarment Official will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of receipt of the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the party. An oral presentation is informal and a transcript usually is not made. The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information and arguments.

        (iv) May identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official.

        (3) Following a review of the record and, if needed, a presentation by the contractor in opposition to the proposed action, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. If so, the Suspension and Debarment Official will initiate the fact-finding process. The fact-finding official will:

        (i) Establish a date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 days of the determination of who will function as the fact-finding official.

        (ii) Grant extensions for good cause.

        (iii) Provide notice of the scheduled hearing.

        (iv) Provide the parties with a schedule for exchange of documents and witness lists.

        (v) Develop an official transcript of the fact-finding proceeding.

        (vi) Provide the Government's representative and the contractor with an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative.

        (vii) Conduct hearings under rules consistent with FAR 9.406-3 pertaining to fact finding. Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finding official.

        (viii) Provide for witness testimony. Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses are subject to cross examination.

        (ix) Prepare written findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence and submit them to both the Suspension and Debarment Official and the contractor within 20 calendar days following the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding.

        (b)  (1) Fact-finding will not be conducted in an action:

        (i) Based on an indictment.

        (ii) When the Suspension and Debarment Official finds no genuine dispute of material facts.

        (2) If the action is not based on an indictment, the Suspension and Debarment Official must coordinate with the Department of Justice or state prosecutorial authority through OIG. Based on the advice received, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine if fact-finding would impair substantial interests of the Federal or state Government. In an action not based on an indictment, a suspended party may:

        (i) Identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases.

        (ii) Request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official to resolve genuine disputes of material fact. For procedures involving a genuine dispute of material fact, see 509.406-3(d)(3).

#### § 511.601

        511.602   General.

#### § 511.602

        (a) The purpose of the DPAS is to assure the timely availability of industrial resources to meet current national defense, energy, and civil emergency preparedness program requirements and to provide an operating system to support rapid industrial response in a national emergency. The primary statutory authority for the DPAS is Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, with additional authority from the Selective Service Act of 1948 and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Executive Orders 12919 and 12742 delegate to the DOC authority to administer the DPAS. Within the DOC, the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security (SIES) is assigned responsibility for DPAS implementation, administration, and compliance.

        (b) The DPAS is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 15 CFR part 700. This regulation provides an overview, a detailed explanation of operations and procedures, and other implementing guidance, including information on special priorities assistance and compliance.

        (c) Orders placed under DPAS are “rated orders.” Rated orders must receive preferential treatment only as necessary to meet delivery requirements. Rated orders are identified by a rating symbol of either “DX” or “DO” followed by a program identification symbol. All “DO” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All “DX” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over “DO” rated orders and unrated orders. A program identification symbol indicates which approved program is supported by the rated order.

        (d) The authority delegated to GSA shall not be used to support the procurement of any product or service that—

        (1) Are commonly available in commercial markets for general consumption;

        (2) Do not require major modification when purchased for approved program use;

        (3) Are readily available in sufficient quantity so as to cause no delay in meeting approved program requirements; or

        (4) Are to be used primarily for administrative purposes (including Federal Supply Classification (FSC) classes, groups, or items), such as for personnel or financial management. The Commissioner, FAS, shall issue additional guidance, as may be necessary, to ensure effective implementation of its delegated DPAS authority.

        511.603   Procedures.

#### § 511.603

        (a) A DPAS rating may be placed against an entire contract at time of award or an individual order issued under an existing, otherwise unrated, contract. FAR 11.604 requires contracting officers to insert the provision at 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency Preparedness, and Energy Program Use, in solicitations when the contract or order to be awarded will be a rated order and to insert the clause at 52.211-15, Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements, in contracts that are rated orders.

        (b) In addition to the FAR provision and clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, the contract or order must include the following ( 15 CFR 700.12):

        (1) The appropriate priority rating symbol ( either “DO” or “DX”) along with the program identification symbol. When GSA contracting officers place DO rated orders, they must use program identification symbol “K1”. When placing a DX-rated order for other agencies, GSA contracting officers must use the requesting agency program identification symbol from the DoD Master Urgency List and may only do so when GSA is acting as the procuring agent for DoD or DoE and has received a “DX” rated contract or order from either department.

        (2) A required delivery date. The words “as soon as possible” or “immediately” do not constitute a required delivery date. Use of either a specific date or a specified number of days ARO (after receipt of order) is acceptable.

        (3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order of an individual authorized to place rated orders.

        (4) A statement that reads substantially as follows: “This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 700)”.

        (c) Multiple and Single Award Schedule contracts are not rated at time of award.

        (2) The clause at 552.212-72, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to GSA Acquisitions of Commercial Products and commercial services) FAR DEVIATION), when any listed clauses therein apply. This clause incorporates by reference only those clauses required to implement provisions of law or Executive orders that apply to commercial products and commercial services (FAR DEVIATION) acquisitions.

        (b)  GSA has a deviation from FAR 52.212-4 that allows use of the clause at 552.212-4 in lieu of the FAR clause at 52.212-4. Insert the clause at 552.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in lieu of the FAR clause at 52.212-4. This clause may be tailored in accordance with FAR 12.302 and GSAM 512.302.

        (c)  Consistent with the limitations contained in FAR 12.302 and 512.302, the contracting officer may include in solicitations and contracts by addendum other GSAR provisions and clauses.

        (d)  The Senior Procurement Executive shall approve the use of a provision or clause that is either not:

        (1) Prescribed in the FAR or GSAR for use in acquisitions for commercial products and commercial services (FAR DEVIATION).

        514.201   Preparation of invitations for bids.

#### § 514.201

        514.201-1   Uniform contract format.

#### § 514.201-1

        Include the following notice in each solicitation:

        514.201-2   Part I—The Schedule.

#### § 514.201-2

        (a) When using Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award, include the following cautionary notice:

        “Notice to Bidders—Use Item 13 of the Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award, to offer prompt payment discounts. The Prompt Payment clause of this solicitation sets forth payment terms. Do not insert any statement in Item 13 that requires payment sooner than the time stipulated in the Prompt Payment clause (See FAR 52.232-25, 52.232-26, or 52.232-27, as applicable). EXAMPLE: If you insert “NET 20” in Item 13, GSA will reject your bid as nonresponsive because the entry contradicts the 30 day payment terms specified in the Prompt Payment clause.”

        (b) When using other authorized forms (e.g., Standard Form 1447, Solicitation/Contract; Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Products and Commercial Services), include the notice in paragraph (a) of this section. Change the reference to the form number, form title, and item number accordingly.

        514.202   General rules for solicitation of bids.

#### § 514.202

        514.202-4   Bid samples.

#### § 514.202-4

        (a)  (1) When bid samples are required, the contracting officer shall require bidders to submit samples produced by the manufacturer whose products will be supplied under the contract.

        (2) The FAR limits use of bid samples to cases where the contracting officer cannot describe some characteristics of a product adequately in the specification or purchase description. This usually applies to subjective characteristics. The contracting officer may determine that there is a need to examine objective characteristics of bid samples to determine the responsiveness of a bid. The contracting officer should base the determination on past experience or other valid considerations. In the solicitation, separately list “Subjective Characteristics” and “Objective Characteristics”.

        (3) Insert the provision at 552.214-72, Bid Sample Requirements, in invitations for bids if bid samples are required. This provision may be modified to fit the circumstances of a procurement.

        (b)  (1) Samples from accepted bids must be retained for the period of contract performance. If there are no outstanding claims regarding the contract, the contracting officer may authorize disposal of the samples at the end of the contract term following the bidder's instructions.

        (2) If the contracting officer anticipates a claim regarding the contract, the contracting officer shall require that the bid samples be retained until the claim is resolved.

        (3) The contracting officer shall require that samples from unsuccessful bids be retained until award. After award, these samples may be disposed of following the bidder's instructions.

        514.203-1   Transmittal to prospective bidders.

#### § 514.203-1

        Prospective bidders, as used in FAR 14.203-1, include both the following:

        (a) The incumbent contractor, except when its written response to the notice of contract action under FAR subpart 5.2 states a negative interest.

        (b) Bidders that responded to recent solicitations for the same or similar items.

        514.270   Aggregate awards.

#### § 514.270

        514.270-1   Definition.

#### § 514.270-1

        means an arrangement whereby two or more separately-priced line items are combined for award to that bidder whose bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government for the line items as a group. The individual price for each item does not have to be the lowest bid received. (See also the definition of a “line item” in FAR FAR 2.101.)

> [64 FR 37211, July 9, 1999, as amended at 86 FR 68442, Dec. 2, 2021]

        514.270-2   Guidelines for use.

#### § 514.270-2

        (a) GSA usually solicits prices and reserves the right to make award for individual line items. In some cases it serves GSA's best interest to combine two or more line items for an aggregate award. Such cases include when:

        (1) Users desire uniformity of design, style, and finish (e.g., suites of household furniture).

        (2) The articles will be assembled and used as a unit, and different manufacturers' components may not be interchangeable.

        (3) Users have high demand for certain articles, but demand for related articles is insufficient to attract competitive bids (e.g., various sized of socket wrenches). Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.

        (4) Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.

        (5) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and another location has a requirement too small to individually attract competitive bids.

        (6) Awarding and administering numerous small contracts for similar articles or services is impractical.

        (b) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, the contracting officer should consider the following factors:

        (1) The capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantities of supplies or services in the aggregate.

        (2) How grouping delivery points will affect bidders.

        (3) Which combinations will accurately project the lowest overall cost to the Government.

        (c) The contracting officer should not use an aggregate award if it will significantly restrict the number of eligible bidders.

> [64 FR 37211, July 9, 1999, as amended at 74 FR 47739, Sept. 17, 2009]

        514.270-3   Evaluation factors for award.

#### § 514.270-3

        The solicitation should clearly state the basis for evaluating bids for aggregate award, require bidders to submit a price on each item within the group or a percentage to be added or subtracted from a list price, and advise bidders that failure to submit prices as required within a group makes a bid ineligible for award for that group.

> [74 FR 47739, Sept. 17, 2009]

        514.270-4   Grouping line items for aggregate award.

#### § 514.270-4

        (a)  This subsection applies to acquisitions of supplies and services.

        (b)  Provide for full and open competition when grouping items for award. Grouping items for award may preclude a significant of firms from bidding. This occurs if firms are unable to provide all the types or quanities of supplies or services, or make deliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective aggregate group.

        (c)  Include only related articles in an aggregate group. Related articles are those normally manufactured or produced by a majority of prospective bidders. Grouping unrelated articles often restricts competition unnecessarily.

        (d)  Consider the following guidelines before deciding to group different geographic locations or delivery points:

        (1) A delivery point may have sufficient requirements so that individual shipments involve economic production runs and carload or truckload quanities. In this case, list it as a separate line item.

        (2) The types of bidders ( small or large firms, manufacturers or distributors, etc.) who responded to previous solicitations can provide important information. For example, if previous bidders are distributors with franchises in certain territories, grouping different territories could tend to restrict competition.

        (3) Transportation costs can affect competition and pricing. They may constitute a significant portion of the total delivered cost. Obtain the advice and assistance of transportation specialists before grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Depending upon the supplies being acquired:

        (i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may reduce competition or result in higher prices. It can cause the loss of “area pricing” advantages provided by a supplier with a single production point.

        (ii) Conversely, for many small commercial products (hand tools, locks, etc.), manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in the U.S.

        (iii) Tariff boundaries can also affect how manufacturers price deliveries to different areas.

        514.270-5   Evaluation methodologies for aggregate awards.

#### § 514.270-5

        (a)  For definite quantity contracts without options, the evaluated bid price is the total bid price, as adjusted for any price-related factors identified in the solicitation. This reflects the actual cost to the Government and will identify the most advantageous bid.

        (b)  Indefinite quantity and requirements contracts use estimated quantities. Options involve the probability of whether and when the options will be exercised. These situations may result in unbalanced bids (see FAR 15.404-1(g)), leading to inaccurate evaluation of the projected cost and award to other than the most advantageous bid. To avoid unbalanced bids, GSA has two preferred methods for evaluating bids for aggregate awards: weight factors and price list.

        (1)  Assign a weight to each item in a group. The weight is based on the portion of quantities that item represents. To evaluate bids, multiply each unit price by its weight factor, then total the results.

        (2)  Establish prices for bidders to use as a base for preparing their bids. Prepare a list that identifies a base price for each item in a group. Bidders bid a percentage factor to add to or subtract from the base price.

        514.270-6   Guidelines for using the weight factors method.

#### § 514.270-6

        (a) Use the weight factors method when there are reliable estimates for the quantities needed in an acquisition. Reliable estimates of quantities form the foundation for:

        (1) Accurate evaluation of the projected cost of each bid.

        (2) An appropriate determination of which bid is most advantageous to the Government for the aggregate group.

        (b) Assign a weight factor to each item in a group. Develop the weight factor by calculating the portion of the total quantity in a defined group that each item represents.

        (c) To evaluate bid prices, first multiply the price bid for each item (unit price X quantity) by its weight factor. Then, add the subtotals together to project the cost for the aggregate group.

        (d) Estimated quantities may be reduced to smaller numbers by a common denominator. This may help facilitate the computations involved in evaluating bids.

        (e) Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest evaluated overall cost to the Government for the aggregate group. This represents the most advantageous bid.

        514.270-7   Guidelines for using the price list method.

#### § 514.270-7

        (a)  The price list method helps avoid unbalanced bidding when making aggregate awards, but lack accurate estimates of anticipated quantities. This method establishes base prices for bidders to use in preparing their bids.

        (b)  When using the price list method, in the solicitation:

        (1) Include the price list.

        (2) Include an estimate of requirements.

        (3) Require the bidder to express its price as “net” or as a percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. “Net” indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its bid.

        (4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this section as a price related evaluation factor.

        (c)  Price lists may be developed using one or more of the following sources:

        (1) Industry published prices.

        (2) Industry surveys.

        (3) Government cost estimates based on knowledge of the supplies or services and previous contract prices.

        (d)  The first time the contracting officer uses list prices for an product or service, give prospective bidders an opportunity to review the proposed list. Also provide information on how GSA will use the list prices. This information may be provided in a draft solicitation.

        (e)  Ensure that the list prices for the grouped items bear a reasonable and balanced relationship to one another. Prices may be used from previous awards made using the weight factors method to develop price lists. Review those prices first to ensure they did not result from unbalanced bidding.

        (f)  Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to the Government. This represents the most advantageous bid.

        (g)  The following illustrates a bidding schedule arrangement for a group of items for aggregate award under the price list method:

        The bid on each item above is the list price shown minus/plus ____ percent. (Bidder, insert “net” or a single percentage amount in the blank space and cross out minus or plus, as appropriate.)

        (h)  Show estimated quantities only if estimates of demand for each item within a group can be derived from Government records or verified contractor sales reports. Use only current estimates. If the Government's needs cannot be estimated, the solicitation may include past orders. (See CG Decision, B-209037, 82-2 CPD para 323 (1982).)

        (i)  In the solicitation:

        (1) List the estimated quantities for work to be performed during both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.

        (2) State the percent of work anticipated to be performed during normal working hours.

        (3) List the unit prices for work to be performed during both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.

        (4) Define “normal” in terms of hours and days of the week.

        (5) Advise bidders of the previous year's total expenditures or portions of that total attributable to the listed items.

        (6) If providing quantity estimates, state that the estimates are for information only and do not constitute guarantees or commitments to order items under the contract.

        (7) Solicit two percentage factors for the line item unit prices listed: one for the unit prices for work performed during normal working hours and the second for the unit prices for work performed outside of normal working hours.

        (8) When the solicitation further groups unit prices by trade or business category, multiple percentages may be required.

        (9) For the evaluated bid price, add together the following percentages:

        (i) The percentage of work performed during normal work hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage factor for that portion of the work, plus

        (ii) The percentage of work performed during other than normal working hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage factor for that portion of the work.

        (10) Consider other price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Make award to the responsible and responsive bidder submitting the lowest overall evaluated bid price for the aggregate group. This represents the most advantageous bid.

#### § 533.103

        533.103-1   Filing a protest.

#### § 533.103-1

        (a) Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the contracting officer will decide the protest. If a party requests a review at a level above the contracting officer, the Agency Protest Official will decide the protest. The decision by the Agency Protest Official for GSA is an alternative to a decision by the contracting officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official for GSA will not consider an appeal of the contracting officer's decision on an agency protest.

        (b) If an agency protest is filed, the deciding official uses the procedures in FAR 33.103 and this section to resolve the protest. The deciding official will provide a fair and quick review of any protest filed with the agency.

        (c) The filing timeframes in FAR 33.103(e) apply. An agency protest is filed when the complete protest is received at the location the solicitation designates for serving protests. GSA's hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Protests delivered after 4:30 p.m. will be considered received and filed the following business day.

        (d) The protest must meet all the following conditions:

        (1) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2).

        (2) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.

        (3) Be filed in writing with the contracting officer.

        (4) State whether the protester chooses to have the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest does not include the protester's choice, then the contracting officer will decide the protest (see paragraph (a) of this subsection).

        (e) The following procedures apply to information submitted in support of or in response to an agency protest:

        (1) GSA procedures do not provide for any discovery.

        (2) The deciding official has discretion to request additional information from either the agency or the protester, orally or in writing, as may be necessary to render a timely decision on the protest. However, protests are normally decided on the basis of information initially provided by the protester and the agency.

        (3) To the extent permitted by law and regulations, the parties may exchange relevant information.

        (4) The agency must make a written response to the protest within ten days unless another date is set by the deciding official.

        (5) The agency must also provide the protester with a copy of the response on the same day it files the protest response with the deciding official. If the agency believes it needs to redact or withhold any information in the response from the protester, it should identify and provide the information to the deciding official for  review.

        (f) A protester may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. GSA will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.

        (g) GSA may dismiss or stay proceedings on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside of GSA.

    PART 536—CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECT-ENGINEER CONTRACTS

### Part 536

**Authority:** Authority: 40 U.S.C. 121(c).

**Source:** Source: 64 FR 37224, July 9, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart 536.1—General

        536.101   Applicability.

#### § 536.101

        This part supplements FAR Part 36 policies and procedures applicable to contracting for construction and architect-engineer services. Contracts for construction management services are covered by FAR Part 37 and GSAM Part 537. Part 536 shall take precedence when the acquisition involves (1) construction or architect-engineer services, and (2) when the requirement is inconsistent with another part of the GSAR.

> [81 FR 4594, Jan. 27, 2016]

        536.102   Definitions.

#### § 536.102

        means the project delivery method where design and construction are contracted concurrently through two separate contracts and two separate contractors. Unlike the traditional design-bid-build delivery method, under the CMc delivery method, the Government awards a separate contract to a designer ( architect-engineer contractor) and to a construction contractor ( CMc contractor) prior to the completion of the design documents. The Government retains the CMc contractor during design to work with the architect-engineer contractor to provide constructability reviews and cost estimating validation. The CMc contract includes design phase services at a firm-fixed-price and an option for construction at a guaranteed maximum price.

      Subpart 536.2—Special Aspects of Contracting for Construction

**Source:** Source: 84 FR 3717, Feb. 13, 2019, unless otherwise noted.

        536.270   Options in construction contracting.

#### § 536.270

        536.270-1   Use of options.

#### § 536.270-1

        (a) Subject to the limitations in this section, contracting officers may include options in contracts when it is in the Government's interest.

        (b) The scope of work in the base contract at award shall require the contractor to provide a discrete and fully functional deliverable. Options shall not be used to incrementally deliver work required to fulfill the requirements of the scope of work for the base contract.

        (c) Contracting officers shall justify in writing the use of options.

        (d) Including an option may be in the Government's interest when, in the judgment of the contracting officer:

        (1) Additional work beyond the base contract is reasonably foreseeable;

        (2) It would not be advantageous to award a separate contract;

        (3) It would not be advantageous to permit an additional contractor to work on the same site;

        (4) Services arising out of or relating to the underlying construction contract may be required during or after substantial completion of the scope of work. For instance, if building equipment (e.g., mechanical and electrical equipment) will be installed under the construction contract, it may be advantageous to have the construction contractor maintain and service the equipment. In such an instance, the services performed may be included as an option to the underlying construction contract. Contracting officers shall ensure that the applicable clauses are included in any such option (e.g., Service Contract Act); or

        (5) It is otherwise justified.

        (e) Options for construction work may provide for an economic price adjustment based on cost or price indexes of labor or materials (see FAR 16.203-4(d)). Subject to the approval of the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA), the contracting officer may develop and insert a project-specific price adjustment clause into the solicitation.

        536.270-2   Solicitations.

#### § 536.270-2

        Solicitations containing options shall:

        (a) Include appropriate option provisions and clauses when resulting contracts will provide for the exercise of options (see 536.270-5);

        (b) State the period within which the options may be exercised; and

        (c) State whether the basis of evaluation is inclusive or exclusive of the options (if exclusive, see 536.270-4(c)).

        536.270-3   Evaluation.

#### § 536.270-3

        For sealed bidding that includes options:

        (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder offering the lowest aggregate price for the base bid and all options designated to be evaluated.

        (b) Before opening bids that include options, the contracting officer must determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following condition is met: The award amount of the base bid and evaluated options does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of items by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement of the low bidder by manipulating the options to be used.

        536.270-4   Exercise of options.

#### § 536.270-4

        (a) The contracting officer shall exercise options in writing within the time period specified in the contract.

        (b) The contracting officer may exercise options only after determining, in writing, that all the following conditions exist:

        (1) Funds are available.

        (2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need.

        (3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.

        (4) The contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see FAR 9.405-1).

        (5) The contractor's performance under the contract met or exceeded the Government's expectation for quality performance, unless another circumstance justifies an extended contractual relationship.

        (6) Exercising the option is in accordance with the terms of the option.

        (7) The option price is fair and reasonable, unless already determined as such (e.g., at time of award).

        (c) The contract modification, or other written document which notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option, must cite the option clause as authority. If exercising an unpriced or unevaluated option, cite the statutory authority permitting the use of other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302).

        (d) When the contract provides for economic price adjustment and the contractor requests a revision of the price, the contracting officer shall determine the effect of the adjustment on prices under the option before the option is exercised.

        536.270-5   Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

#### § 536.270-5

        (a) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-74, Evaluation of Options, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when the solicitation contains an option clause and options will be included in the evaluation for award purposes.

        (b) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-75, Evaluation Exclusive of Options, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when the solicitation includes an option clause and options will not be included in the evaluation for award purposes.

        (c) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-76, Basis of Award-Sealed Bidding Construction, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when contracting by sealed bidding. Use the provision with its Alternate I when the solicitation contains an option clause.

        (d) Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 552.236-77, Government's Right to Exercise Options, in solicitations and contracts for construction that include options.

**Source:** Source: 84 FR 69633, Dec. 19, 2019, unless otherwise noted.

        536.7101   Scope of subpart.

#### § 536.7101

        This subpart describes policies and procedures for the use of the CMc project delivery method.

        536.7102   Definitions.

#### § 536.7102

        As used in this subpart—

        (CCA) means an allowance for the exclusive use of the construction contractor to cover reimbursable costs during construction that are not the basis of a change order. These costs could include estimating, scheduling, and planning errors in the final Estimated Cost of the Work (ECW) or other contractor errors.

        means allowable costs in accordance with FAR Part 31.

        means the final sum of cost of the construction work and fee for the construction work.

        means a set of construction activities that can be clearly defined and separately performed from the remainder of the construction work. Demolition is an example of an early work package.

        (ECW) means the estimated cost of the construction work, not including home office overhead.

        means the amount established in the construction contract for the contractor's profit and home office overhead costs, as described in FAR part 31, for the construction work.

        (GMP) means the sum of the ECW, CCA, and the fee for the construction work.

        536.7103   Construction contract solicitation procedures.

#### § 536.7103

        (a)  The request for proposals should be issued only when the project design requirements have been developed to a sufficient degree of specificity to permit competition with meaningful pricing for the ECW. The contracting officer should obtain written documentation for the contract file from the project manager that the project design requirements satisfy the condition stated in this section.

        (b)

        (1)

        (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this section, the solicitation shall provide that the technical evaluation factors, when combined, shall be considered significantly more important than cost or price.

        (ii) Subject to the approval of the HCA, the weighting of the technical evaluation factors and cost or price may be different than that required under paragraph (i) of this section. Any such written approval shall be documented in the contract file.

        (2)  The contracting officer shall provide for a price realism analysis in the solicitation for the purpose of assessing, among others, whether an offeror's price reflects a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or risk inherent in an offeror's proposal. The solicitation shall provide offerors with notice that the agency intends to perform a price realism analysis.

        (3)  For purposes of evaluation, the total evaluated price shall include the firm-fixed-price for design phase services, the construction work GMP option(s), and any other fixed-priced line items. If advance pricing elements such as extended overhead rates and daily delay rates are proposed, those shall also be evaluated as part of the total evaluated price.

        (c)  Subject to the approval of the contracting director, the solicitation may include information contained or referenced within a prospectus submission to Congress for a project.

        536.7104   Construction contract award.

#### § 536.7104

        In accordance with FAR 4.1001, the contracting officer shall use the SF 1442 to identify the services or supplies to be acquired as separately identified line items on a unit price or lump sum basis including the design phase services, the construction work GMP option(s), and any other work not included in the previously identified items.

        536.7105   Construction contract administration.

#### § 536.7105

        536.7105-1   Responsibilities.

#### § 536.7105-1

        (a) During all phases of the project, the architect-engineer contractor that is providing design services under a separate contract with GSA is contractually responsible for the design in the same manner as under a traditional, design-bid-build project delivery method.

        (b) The design phase services provided by the construction contractor can include, but are not limited to, scheduling, systems analysis, subcontractor involvement, cost-estimating, constructability reviews, cost-reconciliation services, and market analysis.

        (c) The scope of work should task the construction contractor with reviewing the design documents and providing pricing information at various defined milestones during the design phase.

        (d) During the design phase, the architect-engineer contractor and the construction contractor shall collaborate on the design and constructability issues. The goal of this collaboration is to establish a final ECW that does not exceed the original target ECW.

        (e) No discussions between the architect-engineer contractor and the construction contractor shall be considered as a change to the construction contract or design contract unless incorporated by the contracting officer through a modification.

        536.7105-2   Guaranteed Maximum Price.

#### § 536.7105-2

        (a)

        (1)

        (i) The GMP is the ceiling price described by FAR 16.403-2.

        (ii) The GMP is established at contract award. The GMP may be established as one option or as multiple options through separate line items, with a separate GMP amount for each line item.

        (iii) The GMP is subject to adjustment under various standard contract clauses, including the changes clause, differing site conditions clause, and suspensions clause.

        (iv) The contract file shall contain all documents to support any scope changes including a separate analysis to document the rationale for any upward or downward adjustment to the GMP.

        (2)

        (i) The proposed ECW incorporated at construction contract award is the target ECW.

        (ii) The final ECW should be established prior to completion of the design ( 100 percent construction documents), generally no earlier than completion of 75 percent construction documents.

        (iii) The contracting officer shall negotiate the final ECW and incorporate it into the construction contract through a bilateral modification prior to exercising the GMP option.

        (3)

        (i) The CCA type of allowance may only be used as part of the CMc project delivery method and should not be confused with other types of allowances that may be used with other construction project delivery methods.

        (ii) The CCA provides for a contingency relative to a fixed percentage of the ECW, except for the requirements at paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The CCA at time of GMP option exercise is subject to negotiation between the contractor and the contracting officer and may be different than the amount at time of contract award.

        (iii) The amount of the CCA will depend on the status of design and construction, as well as the complexity and uncertainties of the project. Early phase designs usually include less defined scope and, accordingly, may require a higher initial CCA at time of contract award. Later phase designs may remove uncertainties and reduce risk, allowing for a lower CCA at time of GMP option exercise.

        (iv) The CCA shall not exceed 3 percent of the ECW, unless approved in writing by the HCA for a higher amount not to exceed 5 percent of the ECW.

        (4)

        (i) The fee may be proposed per phase of construction if each phase is a separate option.

        (ii) At time of proposal submission, the offeror shall submit a list of the items included within the offeror's home office overhead.

        (iii) At time of proposal submission, the fee elements may be expressed as a percentage of the ECW, but shall be converted to a fixed amount prior to executing the GMP option.

        (iv) The fee for the construction work is not increased or decreased based on fluctuations in the actual costs of the work. The fee may, however be adjusted for changes that are the basis for a change order, including scope changes, differing site conditions, and Government-caused delays.

        (v) Any fee for the construction work associated with a change order shall not be driven by a fixed percentage. The contracting officer should determine whether the profit included, if any, in a contractor's proposal is reasonable, see FAR 15.404-4 for additional guidance. The limitations of GSAR 552.243-71, especially markups, still apply for any changes.

        (b)

        (1) The GMP may be bilaterally modified upward during the design phase only for approved additions to the scope of work.

        (2) The GMP may be bilaterally modified downward during the design phase for deletions to the scope of work.

        (c)

        (1) The GMP option shall not be exercised until the final ECW is established.

        (2) If the sum of the final ECW, CCA, and fee for construction work is less than the GMP as established at contract award or as adjusted in accordance with FAR Part 43, then the contracting officer shall adjust the GMP downward accordingly through a bilateral modification to exercise the GMP option.

        (3) If the sum of the final ECW, CCA, and fee for the construction work is greater than the GMP as established at contract award or as adjusted in accordance with FAR Part 43, then the contracting officer should work with the contractor to identify measures to reduce the overall GMP. Such measures may include reducing the CCA, reducing the fee, or as a last resort, reducing the scope of the project.

        (4) The GMP option shall not be exercised if the final ECW, CCA, and fee for the construction work is greater than the GMP as established at contract award or as adjusted in accordance with FAR Part 43.

        (d)

        (1) After award of the GMP option, changes in scope may be issued as an adjustment to the GMP or as a stand-alone firm-fixed-price line item.

        (2) Any changes in scope after award of the GMP option shall be reflected by a written modification to the construction contract in accordance with FAR Part 43.

        (e)  (1) Early work packages (see 536.7105-7) may be used in the procurement that are priced separately or included in the GMP option.

        (2) If any early work package exercised reduces the scope of the construction services under the GMP option, the ECW shall be reduced, and the CCA, fee for the construction work, and GMP shall be adjusted accordingly.

        (f)  (1) Any changes to the total GMP or individual parts of the GMP must be incorporated in the contract through a modification.

        (2) Any modification that changes the GMP, including modifications for early work packages and fixed price conversions, must clearly state that it includes a change to the GMP and describe the changes to the individual parts of the GMP components in the modification.

        (3) Any modification that changes the total GMP, or individual parts of the GMP, is subject to the requirement for a prenegotiation objectives memo and price negotiation memo, including fair and reasonable price determination, per FAR 15.406.

        (4) The contracting officer should consult other members of the acquisition team, including the project manager, to analyze and justify any adjustments to the total GMP, or individual parts of the GMP.

        536.7105-3   Accounting and auditing requirements.

#### § 536.7105-3

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or through an exemption at FAR 30.201-1, construction contracts under the CMc project delivery method are subject to the cost accounting standards (CAS) identified in FAR Part 30.

        (2) The contracting officer may request a CAS waiver in accordance with the requirements at FAR 30.201-5 and 530.201-5.

        (3) If CAS applies, the contract clauses identified at FAR 30.201-4 shall be included in the contract.

        (4) If a CAS waiver is granted or if CAS does not apply, the contract clause identified at 536.7107(b) shall be included in the contract.

        (b)  (1)  Open book accounting shall be followed for financial tracking of all contract line items that are awarded on a GMP basis. Such financial tracking may be accomplished through an audit in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2)  All payments shall be reconciled with the open book accounting records and the schedule of values adjusted, as appropriate. Reconciliation shall occur each month and should be coordinated with monthly progress payments. The reconciliation shall be documented in the contract file.

        (c)  In accordance with GSAM 542.102(a), for any audit services required by this Subpart 536.71, the contracting officer shall first request such services be performed by or through the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing or the Regional Inspector General for Auditing. If the Office of Inspector General declines to perform such an audit, the contracting officer may obtain audit services from a certified public accountant.

        536.7105-4   Value engineering.

#### § 536.7105-4

        In accordance with FAR 48.202, the clause at FAR 52.248-3 Value Engineering-Construction does not apply to incentive contracts. Accordingly, value engineering, as that term is used and described in FAR Part 48, shall not apply to the CMc project delivery method described in this subpart.

        536.7105-5   Shared savings incentive.

#### § 536.7105-5

        (a)  The incentive is a shared portion of the difference between the final GMP and the final cost of performance. Cost reductions may be realized by the construction contractor as a result of innovations and efficiencies during the construction phase, such as increased labor productivity or strong material subcontract negotiations.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this section, the share ratio for the construction contractor shall range from 30 percent to 50 percent. The share ratio for the construction contractor shall not exceed 50 percent. The complexity of the project and the amount of risk to the construction contractor should be considered when determining the ratio. A project with greater risk to the construction contractor should reflect a greater share ratio for the construction contractor.

        (2) Subject to the approval of the HCA, the share ratio may be different than that required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Any such written approval shall be documented in the contract file.

        (c)  The incentive amount is calculated in accordance with the clause at 552.236-79 Construction-Manager-As-Constructor.

        536.7105-6   Allowances.

#### § 536.7105-6

        (a) Establishing a separate allowance in addition to the CCA is only permitted pursuant to a written determination approved by the contracting director supporting the use of any such allowance.

        (b) The written determination for a separate allowance in addition to the CCA shall consider the following:

        (1) Alternative contracting structures, such as a separate GMP line item or performing the work as part of the GMP option, and

        (2) Ensuring conformance with all applicable rules and procedures relating to allowances, including FAR 11.702.

        536.7105-7   Early work packages.

#### § 536.7105-7

        (a) Construction services for an early work package must be within the scope of the overall contract.

        (b) Early work packages may be part of the initial procurement as a separately priced line item, or the Government and the construction contractor may agree to develop an early work package after award, typically identified toward the beginning of the project.

        (c)

        (1) The parties shall bilaterally agree to the scope, schedule, and pricing for any such early work package, and the contract shall be modified in accordance with FAR Part 43.

        (2) If any such early work package reduces the scope of the construction services under the GMP option, the ECW shall be reduced, and the CCA, fee for the construction work, and GMP shall be adjusted accordingly.

        (3) Any modification to the contract for an early work package is subject to the requirement for a prenegotiation objectives memo and price negotiation memo, including fair and reasonable price determination, per FAR 15.406.

        (d) Early work packages that are firm-fixed-price are not subject to open book accounting, a shared savings incentive, or the need for determination of final settlement.

        536.7105-8   Conversion to Firm-Fixed-Price.

#### § 536.7105-8

        (a) At any time after completion of 100 percent construction documents, the Government and the construction contractor may bilaterally convert the whole contract to firm-fixed-price.

        (b) Conversion to firm-fixed-price may occur after the contingency risks, to be covered by the CCA, have been sufficiently reduced in the best interest of the Government. See FAR 16.103(b) for additional guidance for assessing risk management, profit motive, and timing considerations.

        (c) Conversion to firm-fixed-price is only permitted pursuant to a written determination from the contracting officer to the contract file supporting the conversion. The contracting officer should consult other members of the acquisition team, including the project manager, to analyze and justify the conversion.

        (d) The contracting officer shall not agree to a firm-fixed-price in excess of the GMP.

        (e) In accordance with 536.7105-3(c), the contracting officer shall obtain an independent audit of the construction contractor's costs incurred in the performance of the contract to date.

        (f) When evaluating the construction contractor's proposal for firm-fixed-price definitization, the contracting officer should compare the anticipated final cost to the firm-fixed-price being proposed. It may be reasonable for the construction contractor to include a contingency for assuming the risk associated with agreeing to the firm-fixed-price. The contracting officer should evaluate this contingency to ensure that the proposed amount reasonably reflects the remaining risks being assumed by the construction contractor. This evaluation may be informed by the history of the project, the balance of the CCA, and other factors.

        (g) The modification to convert to a firm-fixed-price is subject to the requirement to obtain cost and pricing data unless one of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 applies.

        (h) The modification to convert to a firm-fixed-price is subject to the requirement for a prenegotiation objectives memo and price negotiation memo, including fair and reasonable price determination, per FAR 15.406.

        (i) Upon converting to a firm-fixed-price, the contract is no longer subject to open book accounting, a shared savings incentive, or the need for determination of final settlement.

        536.7106   Construction contract closeout.

        Unless the contract has been converted to a standard firm-fixed-price contract (see 536.7105-8)—

        (a) The contracting officer shall ensure that the construction contractor's proposal for final settlement is accurate and reliable in accordance with the open book accounting practices of the contract.

        (b) In accordance with 536.7105-3(c), the contracting officer shall obtain an independent audit of the construction contractor's costs.

        536.7107   Contract clauses (FAR DEVIATION).

#### § 536.7107

        (a)  GSA has a deviation from FAR 52.216-17 that allows use of the clause 552.236-79 in lieu of the FAR clause at 52.216-17. Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 552.236-79, Construction-Manager-As-Constructor, in solicitations and contracts if construction, dismantling, or removal of improvements is contemplated when a CMc project delivery method will be followed in lieu of the FAR clause at 52.216-17.

        (b) Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 552.236-80, Accounting Records and Progress Payments, in solicitations and contracts if construction, dismantling, or removal of improvements is contemplated when a CMc project delivery method will be followed and cost accounting standards do not apply. This clause is used when the clauses at FAR 52.230-2 Cost Accounting Standards, FAR 52.230-3 Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices, and FAR 52.230-6 Administration of Cost Accounting Standards do not apply.

        538.201   Coordination requirements.

#### § 538.201

        GSA will coordinate with other agencies who administer FSS contracts specific to their delegated authority ( the Department of Veterans Affairs). Coordination will ensure adherence to policies and procedures at the program level, such as providing guidance on approved exceptions (see 538.001).

#### § 538.270

> [87 FR 10314, Feb. 24, 2022]

        538.270-1   Evaluation of offers without access to transactional data.

#### § 538.270-1

        (a)  Utilize this evaluation methodology for negotiating MAS offers when the commercial sales practices format is included in the solicitation (see 515.408).

        (b) When offerors have commercial catalogs, negotiate concessions from established catalogs, including price and non-price terms and conditions.

        (c) The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the best price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.

        (d) Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant data and determine price reasonableness.

        (e) When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's commercial customers. When determining the Government's price negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:

        (1) Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.

        (2) The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic purchases.

        (3) Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts and concessions offered to commercial customers.

        (4) Length of the contract period.

        (5) Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.

        (6) Ordering and delivery practices.

        (7) Any other relevant information, including differences between the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the most favored commercial customer(s). For example, an offeror may incur more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in the discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best price is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require offerors to provide detailed cost breakdowns.

        (f) You may award a contract containing pricing which is less favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of the following conditions exist:

        (1) The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable, even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.

        (2) Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.

        (g) State clearly in the award document the price/discount relationship between the Government and the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) upon which the award is based.

        538.271   FSS contract awards.

#### § 538.271

        (a) FSS awards will be for commercial products and commercial services.

        (b) Before awarding any FSS contract, determine that the offered prices are fair and reasonable (see FAR subpart 15.4 and 538.270). Document the negotiation and your determination using FAR 15.406-3 as guidance.

> [64 FR 37227, July 9, 1999, as amended at 81 FR 41137, June 23, 2016; 84 FR 17039, Apr. 23, 2019; 86 FR 68443, Dec. 2, 2021]

        538.272   FSS price reductions.

#### § 538.272

        (a)  This section applies when the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting.

        (b) The basic clause and Alternate I of 552.238-81, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the eligible ordering activities and the offeror's customer or category of customers on which the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). If a change occurs in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship between the eligible ordering activities and this customer or category of customers, the change constitutes a “price reduction.”

        (c) Ensure that the contractor understands the requirements of section 552.238-81 and agrees to report all price reductions to the Contracting Officer as provided for in the clause.

#### § 552.101-70

        (a)  (1) GSAR provisions or clauses which are “substantially” the same as a FAR provision or clause (e.g., 552.232-1, Payments) are identified as follows:

        (i) The provision or clause has the same title as the FAR provision or clause.

        (ii) The provision or clause has the same number as the FAR provision or clause, except the number is preceded by the number “5”.

        (i) The number is preceded by the number “5”, and

        (ii) The sequential number at the end of the number of the provision or clause is “70” or a higher number.

        (b)  Each provision or clause in subpart 552.2 is prescribed at the place in the GSAR where the subject matter of the provision or clause receives its primary treatment.

        (c)  Within subpart 552.2, the introductory text of each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in the GSAR that prescribes its use.

        (d)  Since they are subject to revision from time to time, all GSAR provisions, clauses, and alternates are dated; e.g., (DEC 1983). To avoid questions concerning which version of any provision, clause, or alternate is operative in any given solicitation or contract, its date shall be included whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text.

        (1) It requires modification or completion by the Government (e.g., completion of blanks in provisions or clauses) (see FAR 52.104 and 552.104);

        (2) It requires completion by the offeror or contractor;

        (b)  (1) Federal Acquisition Regulation deviations. When a GSAR provision or clause is used with an authorized deviation in lieu of a FAR provision or clause in a solicitation or contract, it shall be identified by—

        (i) The addition of “(FAR DEVIATION)” after the date of the GSAR provision or clause.

        (ii) The addition of standardized language at the beginning of the prescription that reads “ GSA has a deviation from FAR (provision or clause number) . . .”.

        (i) The addition of “(GSAR DEVIATION)” after the date of the GSAR provision or clause.

        (ii) The addition of standardized language at the beginning of the prescription that reads “ GSA has a deviation from GSAR (provision or clause number) . . .”.

        (c)  When a GSAR provision or clause is used with an alternate in a solicitation or contract, it shall be identified by the basic provision or clause citation and the alternate label (e.g., 552.211-77, Packing List (FEB 1996) Alternate I (MAY 2003)). The alternate label consists of the word “Alternate”, the alternate number, and date (e.g., Alternate I (MAY 2003)).

        570.106   Advertising, publicizing, and notifications to Congress.

#### § 570.106

        (a) If a proposed acquisition is not exempt under FAR 5.202 or GSAR 570.106(e), and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed 10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize the proposed acquisition in the System for Award Management Contract Opportunities at .

        (b) For leasehold acquisitions where the solicitation requires the construction of a new building on a preselected site, the contracting officer, in accordance with the timeframes established in FAR 5.203, must publicize the proposed acquisition in the GPE regardless of size or value.

        (c) For leasehold acquisitions not subject to a square foot measurement (e.g., antennas, piers, parking), contracting officers must publicize the proposed acquisition in the GPE when the contract action is expected to exceed $25,000, unless an exception under FAR 5.202 applies.

        (d) Other than as identified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the contracting officer need not publicize the proposed acquisition of a leasehold interest in real property, including expansion requests within the scope of a lease (see 570.403), lease extensions under the conditions defined in 570.405, and building alterations within the scope of a lease (see 570.5). However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions of any dollar value or square footage in the GPE or local newspapers if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary to promote competition.

        (e) The contracting officer may issue a consolidated advertisement for multiple leasing actions.

        (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where publicizing of the proposed acquisition is required, the notice shall be published in the GPE not less than three calendar days prior to issuance of a solicitation.

        (g) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and as set forth in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, the contracting officer shall provide offerors not less than 20 calendar days between solicitation issuance and the date established for receipt of initial offers.

        (1) For a proposed acquisition using simplified lease acquisition procedures (see 570.2), consider the individual acquisition and establish a reasonable response time.

        (2) In cases of unusual and compelling urgency (FAR 6.303-2), provide as much time as reasonably possible under the circumstances and document the contract file.

        (h) If a Member of Congress has specifically requested notification of award, the contracting officer must provide award notifications in accordance with 505.303.

#### § 570.106-1

        (a) Except for lease actions described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, contracting officers must synopsize in the GPE awards exceeding $25,000 total contract value that are likely to result in the award of any subcontracts. However, the dollar threshold is not a prohibition against publicizing an award of a smaller amount when publicizing would be advantageous to industry or to the Government.

        (b) A notice is not required if—

        (1) The notice would disclose the occupant agency's needs and the disclosure of such needs would compromise the national security; or

        (2) The lease—

        (i) Is for an amount not greater than the simplified lease acquisition threshold;

        (ii) Was made through a means where access to the notice of proposed lease action was provided through the GPE; and

        (iii) Permitted the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.

        (c) Justifications for other than full and open competition must be posted in the GPE Information exempt from public disclosure must be redacted.

As part of the determination that a prospective contractor is otherwise qualified and eligible for award, review exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM).

        (b) The contracting officer's signature on the contract is deemed an affirmative determination.

        (c) If the contracting officer finds an offeror nonresponsible, sign and place in the contract file a determination of nonresponsibility. State the basis for the determination.

        (d) If the contracting officer finds a small business concern nonresponsible, the procedures at FAR 19.6 apply. Place all documents and reports supporting a determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility in the lease file.

        (a) The policies and procedures of FAR 15.403 apply to lease contract actions.

        (b) FAR 15.403-1 defines exceptions to and waivers for submitting cost or pricing data. Most leasing actions will have adequate price competition. For price analysis of offered rental rates, the contracting officer may use a market survey, an appraisal conducted using accepted real property appraisal procedures to establish a market price for comparison, or other relevant market research data. For price analysis of offered tenant improvement costs, obtain two offers or cost and pricing data.

        (c) In exceptional cases, the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data may be waived under FAR 15.403-1(c)(4).

        (d) If cost or pricing data are required, follow the procedures in FAR 15.403-4 and 15.406-2.

        (b) Make award in writing and in the timeframe specified in the SFO.

        (1) If the contracting officer cannot make an award in that time, request in writing from each offeror an extension of the acceptance period through a specific date.

        (2) If time is critical, the contracting officer may request the extensions orally. The contracting officer must make a record of the request and confirm it promptly in writing.

        (c) Notify unsuccessful offerors in writing or electronically in accordance with FAR 15.501 and 15.503(b).

        (d) The source selection authority may reject all proposals received in response to an SFO, if doing so is in the best interest of the Government.

#### § 570.401

        (a)  Before exercising an option to renew, follow the procedures in 517.207. The contract must first provide the right to renew the lease. If a renewal option was not evaluated as part of the lease at award, then the addition of a renewal option during the lease term must satisfy the requirements of GSAM 506 regarding full and open competition.

        (b)  Before exercising an option to renew a lease, review current market information to determine that the rental rate in the option is fair and reasonable.

        (a) If a succeeding lease for the continued occupancy of space in a building does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2. Explain the absence of competition in the contract file.

        (b) If a succeeding lease will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may enter into the lease under either of the following conditions:

        (1) The contracting officer does not identify any potential acceptable locations.

        (2) The contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations, but a cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to an offeror other than the present lessor will result in substantial relocation costs or duplication of costs to the Government, and the Government cannot expect to recover such costs through competition.

#### § 570.402-2

        The contracting officer must publish a notice if required by 570.106. The notice should:

        (a) Indicate that the Government's lease is expiring.

        (b) Describe the requirements in terms of type and quantity of space.

        (c) Indicate that the Government is interested in considering alternative space if economically advantageous, and that otherwise the Government intends to pursue a sole source acquisition.

        (d) Advise prospective offerors that the Government will consider the cost of moving, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should relocate.

        (e) Provide a contact person for those interested in providing space to the Government.

        570.402-5   Potential acceptable locations.

#### § 570.402-5

        If the contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations through the advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit analysis following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of the cost-benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:

        (a) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following 570.3.

        (b) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:

        (1) How the contracting officer performed the cost-benefit analysis.

        (2) That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.

        570.402-6   Cost-benefit analysis.

#### § 570.402-6

        (a) The cost-benefit analysis must consider all the following:

        (1) The prices of other potentially available properties.

        (2) Relocation costs, including estimated costs for moving, telecommunications, and alterations, amortized over the firm term of the lease.

        (3) Duplication of costs to the Government.

        (4) Other appropriate considerations.

        (b) Establish the prices for other potentially available properties by requesting each prospective offeror to provide an informational quotation for standard space for comparison purposes.

        (1) Adjust the prices quoted for standard space for any special requirements.

        (2) You do not need a formal SFO to obtain the informational quotation. However, you must provide a general description of the Government's needs.

        (3) If you obtain oral quotations, document the following information, as a minimum:

        (i) Name and address of the firm solicited.

        (ii) Name of the firm's representative providing the quote.

        (iii) Price(s) quoted.

        (iv) Description of the space and services for which the quote is provided.

        (v) Name of the Government employee soliciting the quotation.

        (vi) Date of the conversation.

        (4) Compare the informational quotations to the present lessor's price, adjusted to reflect the anticipated price for a succeeding lease.

        570.403   Expansion requests.

#### § 570.403

        (a) If the expansion space is in the general scope of the lease, the contracting officer may acquire the space through a modification without further justification under FAR 6.3.

        (b) If the expansion space needed is outside the general scope of the lease, the contracting officer must determine whether it is more prudent to provide the expansion space by supplemental agreement to the existing lease or to meet the expansion requirement and existing tenancy to the requirement by competitive means.

        (1) Conduct a market survey to determine the availability of suitable alternative locations.

        (2) If you identify alternate locations that can satisfy the total requirement, perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it is in the Government's best interest to relocate. Consider, as appropriate.

        (i) The cost of the alternate space compared to the cost of expanding at the existing location.

        (ii) The cost of moving.

        (iii) The cost of duplicating existing improvements.

        (iv) The cost of the unexpired portion of the firm lease term. If a termination is possible, use the actual cost of such an action.

        (v) the cost of disruption to the agency's operation.

        (c) If the contracting officer determines not to use competitive procedures and the expansion space is outside the general scope of the lease:

        (1) If the estimated value of the acquisition does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, document the file as required by 570.203-2(b).

        (2) If the estimated value of the acquisition exceeds the simplified lease acquisition threshold, prepare a justification for approval under FAR 6.3 and 506.3.

#### § 570.404

        (a) Consider executing a superseding lease to replace an existing lease when the Government need numerous or detailed modifications to the space that would cause complications or substantially change the present lease or when market conditions warrant renegotiation of an existing lease.

        (b) If the value of the superseding lease exceeds the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. If the cost does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.

        570.405   Lease extensions.

#### § 570.405

        (a) This section applies to extension of the term of a lease to provide for continued occupancy on a short-term basis.

        (b) If the value of a lease extension will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. For extensions that will not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.

        (c) FAR 6.302-1 permits contracting without providing for full and open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. This authority may apply to lease extensions in situations such as, but not limited to, the following:

        (1) The agency occupying the leased space is scheduled to move into other Federally controlled space, but encounters unexpected delays in preparing the new space for occupancy.

        (2) The Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its control in acquiring replacement space.

        (3) The Government is consolidating various agencies and the contracting officer needs to extend the terms of some leases to establish a common expiration date.

        (4) The agency occupying the space has encountered delays in planning for a potential relocation to other federally controlled space due to documented organizational, financial, or other uncertainties.

      Subpart 570.5—Special Aspects of Contracting for Lease Alterations

        570.501   General.

#### § 570.501

        (a) The procedures in 570.502 apply to alterations acquired directly from a lessor by modification or supplemental lease agreement. This is allowed if the following conditions are met:

        (1) The alterations fall within the scope of the lease. Consider whether the work can be regarded fairly and reasonably as part of the original lease requirement.

        (2) The lessor is willing to perform the proposed alterations at a fair and reasonable price.

        (3) It is in the Government's interest to acquire the alterations from the lessor.

        (b) If proposed alterations are outside the scope of the existing lease, decide whether to acquire the alterations through either:

        (1) A supplemental lease agreement, as justified and approved under 570.502-1.

        (2) Government performance or a separate contract. The lease must first provide the Government the right to perform alterations to the leased space.

#### § 570.502

        570.502-1   Justification and approval requirements.

#### § 570.502-1

        If the proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the lease and the contracting officer plans to acquire them from the lessor without competition, the following justification and approval requirements apply:

        (a) If the alteration project will not exceed the micro-purchase threshold identified in FAR 2.101(b), no justification and approval is required.

        (b) If the alteration project will exceed the micro-purchase threshold identified in FAR 2.101(b), but not the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use simplified acquisition procedures and explain the absence of competition in the file.

        (c) If the alteration project will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply.

> [76 FR 30852, May 27, 2011]

        570.502-2   Procedures.

#### § 570.502-2

        (a)  The contracting officer must prepare a scope of work for each alteration project.

        (b)  The contracting officer must obtain an independent Government estimate for each alteration project, including changes to existing alteration agreements with the lessor.

        (c)  (1) The contracting officer must provide the scope of work to the lessor, including any plans and specifications, and request a proposal.

        (2) The contracting officer must request sufficient cost or price information to permit a price analysis.

        (d)  If the contracting officer requires cost or pricing data and the alteration project will exceed the threshold identified in FAR 15.403-4, request an audit.

        (e)  The contracting officer must—

        (1) Determine if the proposal meets the Government's requirements.

        (2) Analyze price or cost information. At a minimum, compare the proposed cost to the independent estimate and, if applicable, any audit results received.

        (3) Analyze profit following FAR 15.404-4.

        (4) Document the analysis under this paragraph and the resulting negotiation objectives.

        (f)  The contracting officer must—

        (1) Exercise sound judgment. Make reasonable compromises as necessary.

        (2) Provide the lessor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.

        (3) Document negotiations in the contract file, including discussions regarding restoration cost or waiver of restoration cost.

        (g)  For modifications not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, lease contracting officers may delegate alteration contracting authority to a warranted contracting officer's representative in GSA or the tenant agency. Alterations awards must reference the lease number. If the modification does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use GSA Form 300, Order for Supplies or Services. Reference the lease on the form.

        (h)  The contracting officer must not make final payment for alterations until the work is:

        (1) Inspected by a qualified Government employee or independent Government contractor.

        (2) Confirmed as completed in a satisfactory manner.

> [76 FR 30852, May 27, 2011]

        570.503   Alterations by the Government or through a separate contract.

#### § 570.503

        If the Government chooses to exercise its right to make the alterations rather than contracting directly with the lessor, the Government may either:

        (a) Have Federal employees perform the work.

        (b) Contract out the work using standard contracting procedures that apply to a construction contract performed on Federal property. If the Government decides to contract for the work, invite the lessor, as well as all other prospective contractors, to submit offers for the project.
