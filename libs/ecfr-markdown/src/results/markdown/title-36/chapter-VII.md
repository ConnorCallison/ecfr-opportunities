    § 701.1   Information about the Library.

#### § § 701.1

    (a)  It is the Library's policy to furnish freely information about the Library to the media. All requests from the media, for other than generally published information and Library records, should be referred to the Public Affairs Office. For information about access to, service of, and employment with the Library of Congress, go to

    (b)  The Public Affairs Office shall have the principal responsibility for responding to requests for information about the Library from representatives of the media; giving advice to Library officers and staff members on public-relations and public-information matters; keeping the Librarian and other officers informed of important developments in this field; and promoting the resources and activities of the Library.

    (1) During regular office hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) telephone operators shall refer requests for information, from the media only, about the Library to the Public Affairs Office. All other requests for information shall be referred to the National Reference Service or other appropriate offices of the Library.

    (2) All other Library offices and staff members who receive inquiries directly from representatives of the media for information about the Library, other than generally published information, shall refer such inquiries to the Public Affairs Office.

    (3) The Public Affairs Office shall respond directly to inquiries concerning the Library, calling upon other offices to supply information to it as necessary, or shall arrange for other offices or staff members, as appropriate, to supply such information directly and report back to Public Affairs after the contact has been made. Requests for Library of Congress records, however, shall be made in accordance with 36 CFR part 703.

    (4) When the Public Affairs Office is closed (evenings, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), requests from the media for information about the Library shall be referred to the Public Affairs Officer at his/her home. In the event that person is not available, inquiries shall be referred to the Acting Public Affairs Officer, or, in turn, a designated public affairs specialist.

    (c)  All Other Library Units and Staff Members shall be responsible for keeping the Public Affairs Office fully and promptly informed of contacts with the press, except in those instances of routine reference inquiries; supplying the Public Affairs Office with any data it requires in order to respond to inquiries from representatives of the media; and reporting promptly to the Public Affairs Office substantive contacts with media representatives about the Library and its policies or activities.

    § 701.2   Acquisition of Library material by non-purchase means.

#### § § 701.2

    (a)  It is the policy of the Library of Congress to foster the enrichment of its collections through gifts of materials within the terms of the Library's acquisitions policies. In implementing this policy, division chiefs and other authorized officers of the Library may undertake, as representatives of the Library, preliminary negotiations for gifts to the Library. However, responsibility for formal acceptance of gifts of material and for approval of conditions of such gifts rests with The Librarian of Congress or his designee. The Chief, African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, and Chief, European and Latin American Acquisitions Division are responsible for routine gifts in the geographic areas covered by their divisions.

    (b)  (1) The Anglo-American Acquisitions Division is the only division in the Library authorized to make technical arrangements, formally negotiate for the transportation of materials and conditions of use at the Library, and prepare written Agreements of Deposit to formalize these negotiations. The term “deposit” is used to mean materials which are placed in the custody of the Library for general use on its premises, but which remain the property of their owners during the time of deposit and until such time as title in them may pass to the Library of Congress. A deposit becomes the permanent property of the Library when title to it is conveyed by gift or bequest. A deposit may be withdrawn by the owner rather than conveyed to the Library. A deposit shall be accompanied by a signed Agreement of Deposit.

    (2) It is the policy of the Library of Congress to accept certain individual items or special collections as deposits when: permanent acquisition of such materials cannot be effected immediately; the depositors give reasonable assurance of their intention to donate the materials deposited to the United States of America for the benefit of the Library of Congress; the Library of Congress determines that such ultimate transfer of title will enrich its collections; and the depositors agree that the materials so deposited may be available for unrestricted use or use in the Library under reasonable restrictions.

    (c)  In cases where donors wish to attach conditions of use, negotiating officers cannot commit the Library to acceptance of such conditions. The Librarian of Congress or designee will consult the appropriate division and service unit officers and the General Counsel to ascertain whether the conditions are generally acceptable.

    § 701.3   Methods of disposition of surplus and/or duplicate materials.

#### § § 701.3

    (a)  All libraries may make selections on an exchange basis from the materials available in the “Exchange/Transfer” category. The policy governing these selections is that exchange be made only when materials of approximately equal value are expected to be furnished in return within a reasonable period. Dealers also may negotiate exchanges of this type for items selected from available exchange materials, but surplus copyright deposit copies of works published after 1977 shall not knowingly be exchanged with dealers. Offers of exchange submitted by libraries shall be submitted to the Chief of the African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, or European/Latin American Acquisitions Division, or their designees, as appropriate, who shall establish the value of the material concerned. Offers from dealers shall be referred to the Chief of the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division. Exchange offers involving materials valued at $1,000 or more must be approved by the Acquisitions Division Chief; offers of $10,000 or more must be approved by the Director for Acquisitions and Support Services; and offers of $50,000 or more must be approved by the Associate Librarian for Library Services. The Library also explicitly reserves the right to suspend, for any period of time it deems appropriate, the selection privileges of any book dealer who fails to comply fully with any rules prescribed for the disposal of library materials under this section or any other pertinent regulations or statutes.

    (b)  Library materials no longer needed by the Library of Congress, including the exchange use mentioned above, shall be available for transfer to Federal agency libraries or to the District of Columbia Public Library, upon the request of appropriate officers of such entities, and may be selected from both the “Exchange/Transfer” and “Donation” categories. Existing arrangements for the transfer of materials, such as the automatic transfer of certain classes of books, etc., to specified Government libraries, shall be continued unless modified by the Library.

    (c)  It is the Library's policy, in keeping with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. 471  which does not cover the Library of Congress, to use materials no longer needed for any of the purposes mentioned above to strengthen the educational resources of the Nation by enriching the book collections of educational institutions (full-time, tax-supported or nonprofit schools, school systems, colleges, universities, museums, and public libraries), public bodies (agencies of local, State, or Federal Government), and nonprofit tax-exempt organizations (section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 501, by authorizing the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division to donate to such groups in the United States any materials selected by their representatives. Eligibility to participate in the donation program shall be limited as defined by procedures established by the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division.

    (d)  Library materials not needed for the collections of the Library, for its exchange and transfer programs, for sale, or for donation, and which, in the opinion of the Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, have no commercial value, may be turned over to the General Services Administration (GSA) to be disposed of in accordance with standard Government practice.

    § 701.4   Contracting Officers.

#### § § 701.4

    While the Librarian of Congress may sign any agreement, certain other offices of the Library have been delegated authority to contract for materials and services on behalf of the Library of Congress.

    (3)  are those in which the Library is a partner with the publisher by terms of a cooperative publishing agreement.

    (4)  are those known or likely to involve subsequent mass distribution, whether by a for-profit or not-for-profit organization or individual, which involve a cooperative agreement. A commercial publication can also include a significant number of LC references and is also approved by the LC office that entered into a formal agreement. Noncommercial publications are those which are produced by non-commercial entities.

    (5)  are those on-line entities, both commercial and non-commercial, that have links to the Library's site.

    (c)  (1) The name “Library of Congress,” or any abbreviation or subset such as “Copyright Office” or “Congressional Research Service,” thereof, is used officially to represent the Library of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof.

As such, it shall be displayed only on official documents or publications of the Library. The seal of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress.

    (ii) Ordinarily, the Library logo should appear in an appropriate and suitable location on all cooperative publications. The Library requires that a credit line accompany reproductions of images from its collections and reflect the nature of the relationship such as “published in association with * * *.”

    (iii) The size, location, and other attributes of the logo and credit line should be positioned in such a way that they do not imply Library endorsement of the publication unless such endorsement is expressly intended by the Library, as would be the case in cooperative activities.

    (e)  (1) All violations, or suspected violations, of this part, shall be reported to the Office of the General Counsel as soon as they become known. Whoever, except as permitted by laws of the U.S., or with the written permission of the Librarian of Congress or his designee, falsely advertises or otherwise represents by any device whatsoever that his or its business, product, or service has been in any way endorsed, authorized, or approved by the Library of Congress shall be subject to criminal penalties pursuant to law.

    (2) Whenever the General Counsel has determined that any person or organization is engaged in or about to engage in an act or practice that constitutes or will constitute conduct prohibited by this part or a violation of any requirement of this part, the General Counsel shall take whatever steps are necessary, including seeking the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, to enforce the provisions of the applicable statutes and to seek all means of redress authorized by law, including both civil and criminal penalties.

    § 701.6   Loans of library materials for blind and other print-disabled persons.

#### § § 701.6

    (a)  Under the Act of March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1487), as amended (2 U.S.C. 135a), the Library of Congress's National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS) provides accessible reading material for the use of blind and other print-disabled residents of the United States, including the several States, Insular Possessions, and the District of Columbia, and United States citizens domiciled abroad. NLS loans literary works and specialized music materials in raised characters (braille), on sound reproduction recordings, or in any other accessible format. NLS also loans devices necessary to reproduce accessible formats, including sound reproducers and refreshable braille displays, and makes audio and braille reading material available for electronic download.

    (b)  (1) Individuals who meet the definition of “eligible person” in 17 U.S.C. 121 are eligible for NLS's loan services. An “eligible person” thus means an individual who, regardless of any other disability—

    (i) Is blind;

    (ii) Has a visual impairment or perceptual or reading disability that cannot be improved to give visual function substantially equivalent to that of a person who has no such impairment or disability and so is unable to read printed works to substantially the same degree as a person without an impairment or disability; or

    (iii) Is otherwise unable, through physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book or to focus or move the eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading.

    (2) Eligibility must be certified by one of the following: doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathy, ophthalmologist, optometrist, psychologist, registered nurse, therapist, and professional staff of hospitals, institutions, and public or welfare agencies (such as an educator, a social worker, case worker, counselor, rehabilitation teacher, certified reading specialist, school psychologist, superintendent, or librarian).

    (c)  Individuals seeking to receive service from NLS shall submit a fully and properly completed application form, available on NLS's website and from network libraries. Eligible persons whose applications for NLS service are approved are referred to in this section as “NLS patrons.”

    (d)  In the lending of items under paragraph (a) of this section, the Librarian shall at all times give preference to:

    (1) The needs of the blind and visually disabled; and

    (2) The needs of eligible persons who have been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces of the United States.

    (e)  NLS's accessible reading materials and devices may be loaned to institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals; to schools for the blind and print-disabled; and to public or private schools. However, these materials and devices may only be used by eligible persons.

    (f)  Libraries designated by the Librarian of Congress serve as state, local or regional centers for the direct loan of accessible reading materials and the loan and repair of devices to NLS patrons in specific geographic areas. These network libraries also publicize the program to NLS patrons and prospective patrons and process applications for service.

    (g)  NLS maintains a special collection of accessible musical scores, instructional texts, and other specialized materials for patrons in furthering their educational, vocational, and cultural opportunities in the field of music. These materials are not housed in network libraries but are loaned directly by NLS to patrons.

    (h)  The Librarian of Congress is authorized by Public Law 116-94, Title XIV, the Library of Congress Technical Corrections Act of 2019, to provide literary works published in raised characters, on sound-reproduction recordings, or in any other accessible format, and musical scores, instructional texts, and other specialized materials used in furthering educational, vocational, and cultural opportunities in the field of music published in any accessible format, to authorized entities located in a country that is a party to the Marrakesh Treaty, if any such items are delivered to authorized entities through online, not physical, means. This authorization is codified at 2 U.S.C. 135a. In implementing this authority, the Librarian shall comply with section 121A of title 17, United States Code, and shall contractually require that the recipient authorized entity likewise administer all materials received from NLS in compliance with section 121A of title 17.

    (i)  For more information, contact the Director, National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20542, or visit the NLS website at

  PART 703—DISCLOSURE OR PRODUCTION OF RECORDS OR INFORMATION

### Part 703

**Authority:** Authority: 2 U.S.C. 136.

**Source:** Source: 67 FR 16019, Apr. 4, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Availability of Library of Congress Records

      § 703.1   Purpose and scope of this subpart.

#### § § 703.1

      (a) This subpart implements the policy of the Library with respect to the public availability of Library of Congress records. Although the Library is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), this subpart follows the spirit of that Act consistent with the Library's duties, functions, and responsibilities to the Congress. The application of that Act to the Library is not to be inferred, nor should this subpart be considered as conferring on any member of the public a right under that Act of access to or information from the records of the Library. Nothing in this subpart modifies current instructions and practices in the Library with respect to handling Congressional correspondence.

      (b) The Copyright Office, although a service unit of the Library, is by law (17 U.S.C. 701) subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, only for purposes of actions taken under the copyright law. The Copyright Office has published its own regulation with respect to the general availability of information ( 37 CFR 201.2) and requests for copyright records made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act ( 37 CFR 203.1 ) and the Privacy Act ( 37 CFR 204.1 ).

      § 703.2   Policy.

#### § § 703.2

      (a) Subject to limitations set out in this part, Library of Congress records shall be available as hereinafter provided and shall be furnished as promptly as possible within the Library to any member of the public at appropriate places and times and for an appropriate fee, if any.

      (b) The Library shall not provide records from its files that originate in another federal agency or non-federal organization to persons who may not be entitled to obtain the records from the originator. In such instances, the Library shall refer requesters to the agency or organization that originated the records.

      (c) In order to avoid disruption of work in progress, and in the interests of fairness to those who might be adversely affected by the release of information which has not been fully reviewed to assure its accuracy and completeness, it is the policy of the Library not to provide records which are part of on-going reviews or other current projects. In response to such requests, the Library will inform the requester of the estimated completion date of the review or project so that the requester may then ask for the records. At that time, the Library may release the records unless the same are exempt from disclosure as identified in § 703.5.

      § 703.3   Administration responsibilities.

#### § § 703.3

      The administration of this part shall be the responsibility of the Chief, Office Systems Services (OSS), Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540-9440, and to that end, the Chief may promulgate such supplemental rules or guidelines as may be necessary.

      § 703.4   Definitions.

#### § § 703.4

      (a)  includes all books, papers, maps, photographs, reports, and other documentary materials, exclusive of materials in the Library's collections, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received and under the control of the Library in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business, and retained, or appropriate for retention, by the Library as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the informational value of data contained therein. The term refers only to such items in being and under the control of the Library. It does not include the compiling or procuring of a record, nor does the term include objects or articles, such as furniture, paintings, sculpture, three-dimensional models, structures, vehicles, and equipment.

      (b)  means a reasonably specific description of a particular record sought, such as the date of the record, subject matter, agency or person involved, etc. which will permit location or retrieval of the record.

      (c)  means records which may be examined or copied or of which copies may be obtained, in accordance with this part, by the public or representatives of the press regardless of interest and without specific justification.

      (d)  or  means making available for examination or copying, or furnishing a copy.

      (e)  includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a federal agency.

      § 703.5   Records exempt from disclosure.

#### § § 703.5

      (a) The public disclosure of Library records provided for by this part does not apply to records, or any parts thereof, within any of the categories set out below. Unless precluded by law, the Chief, OSS, nevertheless may release records within these categories, except for Congressional correspondence and other materials identified in § 703.5(b)(1), after first consulting with the General Counsel.

      (b) Records exempt from disclosure under this part are the following:

      (1) Congressional correspondence and other materials relating to work performed in response to or in anticipation of Congressional requests, unless authorized for release by officials of the Congress.

      (2) Materials specifically authorized under criteria established by Executive Order to be withheld from public disclosure in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and that are properly classified pursuant to Executive Orders.

      (3) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Library. This category includes, in addition to internal matters of personnel administration, internal rules and practices which cannot be disclosed without prejudice to the effective performance of a Library function, such as guidelines and procedures used by auditors, investigators, or examiners in the Office of the Inspector General.

      (4) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:

      (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or

      (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.

      (5) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person as privileged or confidential. This exemption may include, but is not limited to, business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, scientific or manufacturing processes or development information.

      (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which could constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. This exemption includes all private or personal information contained in files compiled to evaluate candidates for security clearances.

      (7) Materials and information contained in investigative or other records compiled for law enforcement purposes.

      (8) Materials and information contained in files prepared in connection with government litigation and adjudicative proceedings, except for those portions of such files which are available by law to persons in litigation with the Library.

      (9) Records having information contained in or related to examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.

      (10) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda, letters or other materials that are part of the deliberative process, the premature disclosure of which would inhibit internal communications or be detrimental to a Library function (e.g., case files in the Manuscript Division).

      (11) Records containing information customarily subject to protection as privileged in a court or other proceedings such as information protected by the doctor-patient, attorney work product, or attorney-client privilege.

      (12) Information submitted by a person to the Library in confidence or which the Library has obligated itself not to disclose such as information received by the Office of the Inspector General through its hotline.

      (13) Materials related to specific patron use of the Library's collections, resources, or facilities either on site or off site. This exemption includes:

      (i) Reader Records. Library records which identify readers by name, such as registration records, reading room logs or registers, telephone inquiry logs, and charge slips, if retained for administrative purposes.

      (ii) Use Records. Users of the Library are entitled to privacy with respect to their presence and use of the Library's facilities and resources. Records pertaining to the use of the Library and of Library collections and subjects of inquiry are confidential and are not to be disclosed either to other readers, to members of the staff who are not authorized, or to other inquirers including officials of law enforcement, intelligence, or investigative agencies, except pursuant to court order or administratively by order of the Librarian of Congress.

      (c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to anyone requesting such records after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section. A portion of a record shall be considered reasonably segregable when segregation can produce an intelligible record which is not distorted out of context, does not contradict the record being withheld, and can reasonably provide all relevant information.

      § 703.6   Procedure for access to and copying of records.

#### § § 703.6

      (a) A request to inspect or obtain a copy of an identifiable record of the Library of Congress shall be submitted in writing to the Chief, OSS, Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540-9440, who shall promptly record and process the request.

      (b) Requests for records shall be specific and shall identify the precise records or materials that are desired by name, date, number, or other identifying data sufficient to allow the OSS staff to locate, retrieve, and prepare the record for inspection or copying and to delete exempted matter where appropriate to do so. Blanket or generalized requests (such as “all matters relating to” a general subject) shall not be honored and shall be returned to the requester.

      (c) Records shall be available for inspection and copying in person during business hours.

      (d) Records in media other than print (e.g., microforms and machine-readable media) shall be available for inspection in the medium in which they exist. Copies of records in machine-readable media shall be made in media determined by the Chief, OSS.

      (e) Library staff shall respond to requests with reasonable dispatch. Use of a record by the Library or Library employees, however, shall take precedence over any request. Under no circumstances shall official records be removed from Library control without the written authorization of the Librarian.

      (f) The Chief, OSS, shall make the initial determination on whether:

      (1) The record described in a request can be identified and located pursuant to a reasonable search, and

      (2) The record (or portions thereof) may be made available or withheld from disclosure under the provisions of this part. In making the initial determinations, the Chief shall consult with any unit in the Library having a continuing substantial interest in the record requested. Where the Chief finds no valid objection or doubt as to the propriety of making the requested record available, the Chief shall honor the request upon payment of prescribed fees, if any are required by § 703.8.

      (g) If the Chief, OSS, determines that a requested record should be withheld, the Chief shall inform the requester in writing that the request has been denied; shall identify the material withheld; and shall explain the basis for the denial. The Chief shall inform the requester that further consideration of the denied request may be obtained by a letter to the General Counsel setting out the basis for the belief that the denial of the request was unwarranted.

      (h) The General Counsel shall make the final determination on any request for reconsideration and shall notify the requester in writing of that determination. The decision of the General Counsel shall be the final administrative review within the Library.

      (1) If the General Counsel's decision reverses in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the Chief shall make the requested record, or parts thereof, available to the requester, subject to the provisions of § 703.8.

      (2) If the General Counsel's decision sustains in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the General Counsel shall explain the basis on which the record, or portions thereof, will not be made available.

      § 703.7   Public Reading Facility.

#### § § 703.7

      (a) The Chief, OSS, shall maintain a reading facility for the public inspection and copying of Library records. This facility shall be open to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and such other times as the Library shall be closed to the public.

      (b) The General Counsel shall advise the Chief, OSS, of the records to be available in the public reading facility following consultation with the Library managers who may be concerned.

      § 703.8   Fees and charges.

#### § § 703.8

      (a) The Library will charge no fees for:

      (1) Access to or copies of records under the provisions of this part when the direct search and reproduction costs are less than $10.

      (2) Records requested which are not found or which are determined to be exempt under the provisions of this part.

      (3) Staff time spent in resolving any legal or policy questions pertaining to a request.

      (4) Copies of records, including those certified as true copies, that are furnished for official use to any officer or employee of the federal government.

      (5) Copies of pertinent records furnished to a party having a direct and immediate interest in a matter pending before the Library, when furnishing such copies is necessary or desirable to the performance of a Library function.

      (b) When the costs for services are $10 or more, the Chief, OSS, shall assess and collect the fees and charges set out in appendix A to this part for the direct costs of search and reproduction of records available to the public.

      (c) The Chief, OSS, is authorized to waive fees and charges, in whole or in part, where it is determined that the public interest is best served to do so, because waiver is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Persons seeking a waiver or reduction of fees may be required to submit a written statement setting forth the intended purpose for which the records are requested or otherwise indicate how disclosure will primarily benefit the public and, in appropriate cases, explain why the volume of records requested is necessary. Determinations made pursuant to the authority set out herein are solely within the discretion of the Chief, OSS.

      (d) Fees and charges for services identified in the appendix to this part shall be paid in full by the requester before the records are delivered. Payment shall be made in U.S. funds by personal check, money order, or bank draft made payable to the Library of Congress. The Chief, OSS, shall remit all fees collected to the Director, Financial Services, who shall cause the same to be credited to appropriate accounts or deposited with the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

      (e) The Chief, OSS, shall notify a requester and may require an advance deposit where the anticipated fees will exceed $50.

    Subpart B—Testimony by Employees and Production of Documents in Certain Legal Proceedings Where the Library Is Not a Party

      § 703.15   Purpose and scope of this subpart.

#### § § 703.15

      This subpart sets forth the policy and procedures of the Library of Congress regarding, first, the testimony, as witnesses in legal proceedings where the Library is not a party, of employees and former employees concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official relationship with the Library of Congress, and second, the production or disclosure of information contained in Library of Congress documents for use in legal proceedings where the Library is not a party, pursuant to a request, order, or subpoena (collectively referred to in this subpart as a “demand”).

      (a) This subpart applies to:

      (1) State court proceedings (including grand jury proceedings);

      (2) Federal court proceedings; and

      (3) State and local legislative and administrative proceedings.

      (b) This subpart does not apply to:

      (1) Matters that are not related to the Library of Congress but relate solely to an employee's personal dealings;

      (2) Congressional demands for testimony or documents;

      (3) Any demand relating to activity within the scope of Title 17 of the United States Code (the Copyright Act and related laws). These are governed by Copyright Office regulations, which provide for different procedures and for service on the General Counsel of the Copyright Office.  37 CFR 201.1, sec. 203, sec. 204, and sec. 205.

      (c) The purpose of this subpart is to ensure that employees' official time is used only for official purposes, to maintain the impartiality of the Library of Congress among private litigants, to ensure that public funds are not used for private purposes, to ensure the protection of Congress' interests, and to establish centralized procedures for deciding whether or not to approve testimony or the production of documents.

      § 703.16   Policy on presentation of testimony and production of documents.

#### § § 703.16

      No Library of Congress employee may provide testimony or produce documents in any proceeding to which this part applies concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official relationship with the Library of Congress, unless authorized by the General Counsel or his/her designee, or the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) with respect to records and testimony relating to CRS's work for Congress, or the Law Librarian for records and testimony relating to the Law Library's work for Congress or materials prepared for other federal agencies covered by evidentiary privileges. The aforementioned officials (hereinafter “deciding officials”) will consider and act upon demands under this part with due regard for the interests of Congress, where appropriate, statutory requirements, the Library's interests, and the public interest, taking into account factors such as applicable privileges and immunities, including the deliberative process privilege and the speech or debate clause, the need to conserve the time of employees for conducting official business, the need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes, the need to maintain impartiality among private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not involved, the established legal standards for determining whether or not justification exists for the disclosure of confidential information and records, and any other purpose that the deciding official deems to be in the interest of Congress or the Library of Congress.

      § 703.17   Procedures when testimony and/or documents are demanded.

#### § § 703.17

      A demand for testimony and/or documents by a Library employee must be in writing, must state the nature of the requested testimony and/or specify documents, and must meet the requirements of § 703.15. A demand must also show that the desired testimony or document is not reasonably available from any other source and must show that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony. When an employee of the Library receives such a request the employee will immediately forward it, with the recommendation of the employee's supervisors, to the appropriate deciding official under § 703.22 of this part. The deciding official, in consultation with the appropriate offices of the Library or congressional offices, will determine whether or not compliance with the request would be appropriate and will respond as soon as practicable.

      § 703.18   Procedures when an employee's appearance is demanded or documents are demanded.

#### § § 703.18

      (a) If the deciding official has not acted by the return date on a subpoena, the employee must appear at the stated time and place (unless advised by the deciding official that the subpoena was not validly issued or served or that the subpoena has been withdrawn) and inform the court (or other interested parties) that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of the appropriate Library or congressional officials and shall respectfully request the court (or other authority) to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.

      (b) If the deciding official has denied approval to comply with the subpoena, and the court or authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of such a denial, the employee upon whom such a demand has been made shall produce a copy of this Part and shall respectfully refuse to provide any testimony or produce any documents.  v.  340 U.S. 462 (1951).

      (c) The deciding official, as appropriate, will request the assistance of the Department of Justice or the U.S. Attorney's Office or congressional officials where necessary to represent the interests of the Library, the Congress, and the employee in any of the foregoing proceedings.

      § 703.19   Requests for authenticated copies of Library documents.

#### § § 703.19

      Requests for authenticated copies of Library documents for purposes of admissibility under 28 U.S.C. 1733 and Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be granted for documents that would otherwise be released pursuant to the Library's Regulations governing the release of information. The advice of the appropriate deciding official should be obtained concerning the proper form of authentication and information as to the proper person having custody of the record.

      § 703.20   File copies.

#### § § 703.20

      The Office of the General Counsel will maintain the official file of copies of all demands served on the Library and deciding officials' responses.

      § 703.21   Effect of this part.

#### § § 703.21

      This part is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operations of the Library of Congress and is not intended to, and does not, and may not, be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the Library of Congress or the United States.

**Source:** Source: 69 FR 39843, July 1, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

    § 705.1   Scope and purpose of this part.

#### § § 705.1

    The purpose of this part is to implement certain provisions of the American Television and Radio Archives Act, 2 U.S.C. 170. Specifically, this part prescribes rules pertaining to the reproduction, compilation, and distribution by the Library of Congress, under section 170(b) of title 2 of the United States Code, of television and radio transmission programs consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of news events.

    § 705.2   Authority.

#### § § 705.2

    Section 170(b) of Title 2 authorizes the Librarian, with respect to a transmission program which consists of a regularly scheduled newscast or on-the-spot coverage of news events, to prescribe by regulation standards and conditions to reproduce, compile, and distribute such a program as more particularly specified in the statute.

    § 705.3   Definitions.

#### § § 705.3

    For purposes of this part:

    (a) The terms copies, fixed, phonorecords and transmission program, and their variant forms, have the meanings given to them in section 101 of title 17 of the United States Code. For the purpose of this part, the term transmission includes transmission via the Internet, cable, broadcasting, and satellite systems, and via any other existing or future devices or processes for the communication of a performance or display whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent. 17 U.S.C. 101; H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64 (1976).

    (a) Library of Congress staff acting under the general authority of the Librarian of Congress may reproduce fixations of television and radio transmission programs consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of news events directly from transmissions to the public in the United States in accordance with section 170(b) of title 2 of the United States Code. Recording may be accomplished in the same or another tangible form as the original transmission. The choice of programs selected for recording will be made consistent with the purpose of, and based on the criteria set forth in, the American Television and Radio Archives Act at 2 U.S.C. 170(a), and on Library of Congress acquisition policies in effect at the time of recording.

    (b) Specific notice of an intent to copy a transmission program will ordinarily not be given. In general, the Library of Congress will seek to copy off-the-air selected portions of the programming transmitted by both noncommercial educational broadcast stations as defined in section 397 of title 47 of the United States Code, and by commercial broadcast stations. Upon written request addressed to the Chief, Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division by a broadcast station or other owner of the right of transmission, the Library of Congress will inform the requestor whether a particular transmission program has been copied by the Library.
