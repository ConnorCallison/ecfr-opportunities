OMB regulations and OMB's approval and assignment of control numbers are conditioned upon Treasury bureaus not requiring more than three copies (including the original) of any document of information. OMB has granted a waiver to permit the Department to require up to eight copies of proposal packages, including proprietary data, for solicitations, provided that contractors who submit only an original and two copies will not be placed at a disadvantage.

**Source:** Source: 82 FR 53429, Nov. 16, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

        1009.7000   Scope of subpart.

#### § 1009.7000

        This subpart prescribes the IRS policies and procedures for performing a tax check on the apparent successful offeror to determine eligibility to receive an award.

        1009.7001   Definition.

#### § 1009.7001

        As used in this subpart—

        means the person(s) identified to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the consent to disclosure by the offeror as authorized to represent the offeror in disclosure matters pertaining to the offer.

        means any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability.

        means an IRS process that accesses and uses taxpayer return information to support the Government's determination of an offeror's eligibility to receive an award, including but not limited to implementation of the statutory prohibition of making an award to corporations that have a delinquent Federal tax liability (see FAR 9.104-5(b)).

        1009.7003   Policy.

#### § 1009.7003

        (a) There are various Federal laws and regulations that in aggregate prohibit the Federal Government from entering into a contract with an entity where the awarding agency is aware of an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR subpart 9.1) unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment and has made a determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.

        (b) IRS contracting officers shall include a provision in all solicitations regardless of dollar value, which contains a consent to disclosure to be signed and dated by a person authorized to act on behalf of the offeror as defined in 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1(e)(4). The consent to disclosure will authorize officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury, including the IRS, to disclose the results of the tax check to the authorized representative(s) of the offeror. In the absence of a signed and dated consent to disclosure in an offer, taxpayer return information of the offeror may not be disclosed, which subsequently may remove the offeror from eligibility to receive an award.

        1009.7004   Procedure.

#### § 1009.7004

        IRS contracting officers shall not proceed with award, at any dollar value, until a tax check has been performed on the apparent successful offeror. See IRS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 9.1.

        (a) The contracting officer, regardless of an offeror's response in paragraph (a)(1) of the provision 52.209-5, Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters, paragraph (b)(1) of the provision at FAR 52.209-11, or paragraphs (h) and (q)(2)(i) of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 9.104-5(b)), shall request a tax check through the IRS designated point of contact. The request shall include only the information required for purposes of conducting the tax check.

        (b) If the result of the tax check demonstrates the offeror as having a delinquent Federal tax liability, the contracting officer shall—

        (1) Confirm the offer includes a signed and dated consent to disclosure (see 1052.209-70, Notice and Consent to Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information), the absence of which may remove the offeror from eligibility to receive an award under the solicitation because taxpayer return information of the offeror may not be disclosed.

        (2) If the consent to disclosure is completed in the offer, notify the authorized representative(s) of the offeror that a delinquent Federal tax liability exists and therefore the offeror is ineligible for award.

        (i) If upon notification the offeror provides the contracting officer with documentation, within the timeframe specified by the contracting officer, that demonstrates the offeror's tax status as being paid-in-full or that an approved payment agreement is in place, the contracting officer will coordinate with the appropriate office within IRS to validate the tax status. If the offeror is found to be tax compliant, the contracting officer will notify the offeror of such. Assuming the offeror meets all other standards of responsibility, the offeror is eligible for award.

        (3) Notify, in accordance with IRS PGI 9.1, the Department of the Treasury official responsible for suspension and debarment for purposes of requesting a determination in accordance with FAR 9.104-5(a)(2) and FAR 9.104-5(b)(3) respectively before an award to that contractor can be made.

        (c) If the result of the tax check demonstrates the offeror as tax compliant then the offeror is eligible for award, assuming all other standards of responsibility have been met.

        (d) The contracting officer shall include in the contract file documentation that verifies the tax check was conducted and if the results confirm a delinquent Federal tax liability existed at the time of award, confirmation that the offeror was notified of such.

        1009.7005   Solicitation provision.

#### § 1009.7005

        (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision 1052.209-70, Notice and Consent to Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information, in all IRS solicitations regardless of dollar value, including solicitations for acquisition of commercial items (including Commercially Available Off-The-Shelf items).

      Subpart 1019.2—Policies

        1019.202   Specific policies.

#### § 1019.202

        1019.202-70   The Treasury Mentor Protégé Program.

#### § 1019.202-70

        (a)-(b) [Reserved]

        (c)  For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm may not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely on the basis that the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance referred to in paragraph (m) of this section, from such mentor firm under the Mentor-Protégé Program.

        (d)  (1) Eligible contractors, not included on the “System for Award Management Exclusions” that are approved as mentors will enter into agreements with eligible protégés. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as contractors or subcontractors.

        (2) A firm's status as a protégé under a Treasury contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other contracts or subcontracts.

        (e)  (1) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), Treasury is authorized to provide appropriate incentives in negotiated contractual actions to encourage subcontracting opportunities consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. Proposed mentor-protégé efforts will be considered during the evaluation of such negotiated, competitive offers. Contracting Officers may provide, as an incentive, a bonus score, not to exceed 5% of the relative importance assigned to the non-price factors. If this incentive is used, the Contracting Officer shall include language in the solicitation indicating that this adjustment may occur.

        (2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance (if any) under such an existing arrangement, will be considered by the Contracting Officer in:

        (i) Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under FAR 19.705-4; and,

        (ii) Evaluating the contractor compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).

        (3) The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) Mentoring Award is a non-monetary award that will be presented (annually on a fiscal year basis or as often as is appropriate) to the mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Director, OSDBU.

        (f) [Reserved]

        (g)  A mentor firm may be either a large or small business, eligible for award of a Government contract that can provide developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as subcontractors. Mentors will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with protégés in addition to firms with whom they have established business relationships.

        (h)  (1) For selection as a protégé, a firm must be:

        (i) A small business, women-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, small business owned and controlled by veteran or service disabled veteran, or qualified HUBZone small business, or a qualified 8(a) concern;

        (ii) Qualified as a small business under the NAICS code for the services or supplies to be provided by the protégé under its subcontract to the mentor; and

        (iii) Eligible for award of Government contracts.

        (2) Except small disadvantaged businesses and qualified HUBZone small business firms, a protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. The h(1)(i), small disadvantaged business, or qualified HUBZone small business status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined according to FAR 19.304 and 19.1303, respectively.

        (3) Protégés may not have multiple mentors unless approved, in writing, by the Director, OSDBU. Protégés participating in other agency mentor protégé programs in addition to the Treasury Mentor-Protégé Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each agency's program.

        (i)  (1) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protégé firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and select the types of protégé firms listed in 1019.202-70(h). Mentor firms may have multiple protégés.

        (2) The selection of protégé firms by mentor firms may not be protested. Any question regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a mentor to be a protégé must be referred solely to Treasury's OSDBU for resolution. Treasury, at its discretion, may seek an advisory opinion from the Small Business Administration (SBA).

        (j)  (1) Firms interested in becoming a mentor firm may apply in writing to Treasury's OSDBU. The application will be evaluated based upon the description of the nature and extent of technical and managerial support proposed as well as the extent of other developmental assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture support and traditional subcontracting support.

        (k)  (1) OSDBU will review the information specified in 1019.202-70(l). The OSDBU review will be completed no later than 30 calendar days after receipt.

        (2) Upon completion of the review, the mentor may implement the developmental assistance program.

        (3) An approved agreement will be incorporated into the mentor firm's contract(s) with Treasury.

        (4) If OSDBU disapproves the agreement, the mentor may provide additional information for reconsideration. Upon finding deficiencies that OSDBU considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the mentor and provide a list of defects. Any additional information or corrections requested will be provided within 30 calendar days. The review of any supplemental material will be completed within 30 calendar days after receipt by OSDBU. When submission of additional data is required during a proposal evaluation for a new contract award, shorter timeframes for submission, review and re-evaluation for approval may be authorized by OSDBU.

        (5) The agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and protégé firms only. The agreement itself does not create any privity of contract between the mentor or protégé and Treasury.

        (l)  The contents of the agreement will contain:

        (1) Names and addresses of mentor and protégé firms and a point of contact within both firms who will oversee the agreement;

        (2) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the protégé firm, OSDBU and the Contracting Officer, in writing, at least 30 days in advance of the mentor firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw from the Mentor-Protégé Program;

        (3) Procedures for a protégé firm to notify the mentor firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of the protégé firm's intent to voluntarily terminate the mentor-protégé agreement. The mentor must notify OSDBU and the Contracting Officer immediately upon receipt of such notice from the protégé;

        (4) Each proposed mentor-protégé relationship must include information on the mentor's ability to provide developmental assistance to the protégé and how that assistance will potentially increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for the protégé firm;

        (5) A description of the type of developmental program that will be provided by the mentor firm to the protégé firm, to include a description of the potential subcontract work, and a schedule for providing assistance and criteria for evaluation of the protégés developmental success;

        (6) A listing of the types and dollar amounts of subcontracts that may be awarded to the protégé firm;

        (7) Program participation term;

        (8) Termination procedures;

        (9) Plan for accomplishing work should the agreement be terminated; and

        (10) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.

        (m)  The forms of developmental assistance a mentor can provide to a protégé include:

        (1) Management guidance relating to financial management, organizational management, overall business management/planning, business development, and technical assistance.

        (2) Loans;

        (3) Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;

        (4) Property;

        (5) Temporary assignment of personnel to protégé for purpose of training; and

        (6) Any other types of mutually beneficial assistance.

        (n)  (1) Mentor or protégé firms may voluntarily withdraw from the Mentor-Protégé Program. However, such withdrawal shall not excuse the contractor from compliance with contract requirements.

        (2) At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, the contractor and protégé must formally brief the Department of the Treasury team regarding program accomplishments as they pertain to the approved agreement. Individual briefings may be conducted, at the request of either party. Treasury will consider the following:

        (i) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to increase the participation of protégés as suppliers to the Federal government and to commercial entities;

        (ii) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of a protégé as defined in the agreement;

        (iii) To what extent the protégé has met the developmental objectives in the agreement; and

        (iv) To what extent the mentor firm's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program resulted in the protégé receiving contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the Department of the Treasury.

        (v) Mentor and protégé firms must submit an evaluation to OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the Mentor-Protégé Program, whichever comes first.

        (vi) Protégé firms shall submit a post completion report 24 months after exiting the Mentor-Protégé Program. The post completion report will assist the Department of the Treasury in assessing the progress of Protégé firms upon completion of the program.

        (o) [Reserved]

        (p)  (1) Insert the provision at 1052.219-73, Department of the Treasury Mentor-Protégé Program, in all unrestricted solicitations exceeding $650,000 ($1,500,000 for construction) that offer subcontracting possibilities.

        (2) Insert the clause at 1052.219-75, Mentor Requirements and Evaluation, in solicitations and contracts where the contractor is a participant in the Treasury Mentor-Protégé Program.

        1032.770   Incremental funding during a Continuing Resolution.

#### § 1032.770

        1032.770-1   Scope of section.

#### § 1032.770-1

        This section provides policy and procedure for using incremental funding for fixed-price, time-and-material and labor-hour contracts during a period in which funds are provided to Treasury Departmental Offices or Bureaus, under a continuing resolution (CR). HCAs may develop necessary supplemental internal procedures as well as guidance to advise potential offerors, offerors and contractors of these policies and procedures. Additionally, Bureaus who receive non-appropriated funds may utilize and tailor these policies and procedures to fit their needs.

        1032.770-2   Definition.

#### § 1032.770-2

        “Continuing Resolution” means an appropriation, in the form of a joint resolution, that provides budget authority for federal agencies, specific activities, or both to continue operation until the regular appropriations are enacted. Typically, a continuing resolution is used when legislative action on appropriations is not completed by the beginning of a fiscal year.

        1032.770-3   General.

#### § 1032.770-3

        The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 and FAR 32.702, states that no officer or employee of the Government may create or authorize an obligation in excess of the funds available, or in advance of appropriations unless otherwise authorized by law. A CR provides funding for continuing projects or activities that were conducted in the prior fiscal year for which appropriations, funds, or other authority was previously made available. Each CR is governed by the specific terms in that specific CR ( duration of the CR) and under certain CRs, the funding amounts available for award of contract actions are inadequate to fund the entire amounts needed for some contract actions.

        1032.770-4   Policy.

#### § 1032.770-4

        (a) A fixed-price, time-and-materials or labor-hour contract or order for commercial or non-commercial supplies or severable or non-severable services may be incrementally funded when—

        (1) Funds are provided to a Treasury Departmental Office or Bureau under a CR. This includes funds appropriated to a bureau, funds appropriated to another entity that will be directly obligated on a Treasury contract, and funds in a revolving fund or similar account that will be reimbursed by a customer agency funded by a CR;

        (2) Sufficient funds are not being allocated from the responsible fiscal authority to fully fund the contract action that is otherwise authorized to be issued;

        (3) There is no statutory restriction that would preclude the proposed use of funds;

        (4) Funds are available and unexpired, as of the date the funds are obligated;

        (5) Assurance is provided by the responsible financial authority that full funding is anticipated once an Appropriation Act is enacted; and

        (6) The clause prescribed by 1032.770-7 is incorporated into the contract or order.

        (b) Incremental funding may be limited to individual line item(s) or a particular order(s).

        1032.770-5   Limitations.

#### § 1032.770-5

        (a) This policy does not apply to contract actions that are not covered by the CR.

        (b) If this policy is applied to non-severable services or to supplies, the contracting officer shall take into consideration the business risk to the Government if funding does not become available to fully fund the contract. If the contracting officer determines the use of incremental funding for non-severable services or supplies is in the best interest of the Government the contracting officer shall ensure the contractor fully understands how the limitations of the Government's liabilities under the contract might impact its ability to perform within the prescribed contract schedule.

        1032.770-6   Procedures.

#### § 1032.770-6

        (a) An incrementally funded fixed-price, time-and-materials or labor-hour contract shall be fully funded once funds are available.

        (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that sufficient funds are allotted to the contract to cover the total amount payable to the contractor in the event of termination of convenience by the Government.

        (c) Upon receipt of the contractor's notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1052.232-90, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly provide written notice to the contractor that the Government is—

        (i) Obligating additional funds for continued performance and increasing the Government's limitation of obligation in a specified amount;

        (ii) Obligating the full amount of funds needed;

        (iii) Terminating for convenience, as applicable, the affected line items or contract; or

        (iv) Considering whether to allot additional funds; and

        (A) The contractor is entitled by the contract terms to stop work when the Government's limitation of obligation is reached; and

        (B) Any costs expended beyond the Government's limitation of obligation are at the contractor's risk.

        (d) Upon learning that the contract will receive no further funds by the date provided in the notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1052.232-70, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly give the contractor written notice of the Government's decision and terminate the affected line items or contract, as applicable, for the convenience of the Government.

        1032.770-7   Clause.

#### § 1032.770-7

        The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1052.232-70, Limitation of Government's Obligation, in

        (a) Solicitations and resultant contracts when incremental funding of fixed-price, time-and-material or labor-hour contract via a CR is anticipated; or

        (b) Contracts or orders when incremental funding of a fixed-price, time-and-material or labor-hour contract is authorized and the Treasury Departmental Office or Bureau is operating under a CR (see 1032.770-4); and

        (c) The CO shall insert the information required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of the clause.

        (2) The contractor has demonstrated that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome; or

        (3) The contractor is in the process of transitioning to electronic submission of payment requests, but needs additional time to complete such transition. Authorizations granted on this basis must specify a date by which the contractor will transition to electronic submission.
