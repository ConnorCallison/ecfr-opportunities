    § 2200.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 2200.10

    This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Corporation for National and Community Service policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the Corporation for National and Community Service to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

    § 2200.20   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 2200.20

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction.” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970.

    (b) Respondent in a Corporation for National and Community Service suspension or debarment action;

    (c) Corporation for National and Community Service debarment or suspension official; or

    (d) Corporation for National and Community Service grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

    § 2200.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 2200.30

    The Corporation for National and Community Service policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (, 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (, Sec. 2200.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Corporation for National and Community Service policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

    § 2200.137   Who in the Corporation for National and Community Service may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 2200.137

    The Chief Executive Officer (or another official designated by the Chief Executive Officer) has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.

    § 2200.220   What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

#### § § 2200.220

    Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), Corporation for National and Community Service does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

    § 2200.332   What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 2200.332

    You as a participant must include a term or condition in lower-tier transactions requiring lower-tier participants to comply with Subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180.

    § 2200.437   What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

#### § § 2200.437

    To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you as an agency official must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
