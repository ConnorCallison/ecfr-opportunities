      § 745.1   Advance notification and annual report of all exports of Schedule 1 chemicals to other States Parties.

#### § § 745.1

      Pursuant to the Convention, the United States is required to notify the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) not less than 30 days in advance of every export of a Schedule 1 chemical, in any quantity, to another State Party. In addition, the United States is required to provide a report of all exports of Schedule 1 chemicals to other States Parties during each calendar year. If you plan to export any quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical controlled under the EAR and licensed by the Department of Commerce or controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and licensed by the Department of State, you are required under this section to notify the Department of Commerce in advance of this export. You are also required to provide an annual report of exports that actually occurred during the previous calendar year. The United States will transmit the advance notifications and an aggregate annual report to the OPCW of exports of Schedule 1 chemicals from the United States. Note that the notification and annual report requirements of this section do not relieve the exporter of any requirement to obtain a license from the Department of Commerce for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the EAR or from the Department of State for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the ITAR.

      § 746.1   Introduction.

#### § § 746.1

      In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part implements broad based controls for items and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement U.S. government policies. Two categories of controls are included in this part.

      (a)  This part contains or refers to all the BIS licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptions for countries subject to general embargoes or comprehensive sanctions, currently Cuba, Iran, and Syria. This part is the focal point for all the EAR requirements for transactions involving these countries.

      (1)  All the items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) require a license to _Cuba._ In addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the CCL, designated by the Number “EAR99”, require a license to Cuba. Most items requiring a license to these destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.

      (2)  BIS maintains license requirements and other restrictions on exports and reexports to _Iran._ A comprehensive embargo on transactions involving this country is administered by the Department of The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

      (3)  Pursuant to Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(a)(2)(A) of the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-175, codified as a note to 22 U.S.C. 2151) (the SAA), since May 14, 2004 BIS has maintained a prohibition on the export to Syria of all items on the Commerce Control List (in 15 CFR part 774) (CCL) and a prohibition on the export to Syria of products of the United States, other than food and medicine. The President also exercised national security waiver authority pursuant to Section 5(b) of the SAA for certain transactions. Section 746.9 of this part sets forth the specific license requirements, licensing policy and license exceptions applicable to Syria as a sanctioned country under the EAR. These provisions were issued consistent with Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004 which implemented the SAA.

      (b)  (1) BIS controls the export and reexport of selected categories of items to countries under United Nations Security Council arms embargoes. See the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774. See also §§ 746.3 (Iraq) and 746.4 (North Korea).

      (2) The countries subject to United Nations Security Council arms embargoes are: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, and Sudan.

      (3) A license is required to export or reexport items identified in Part 774 as having a “UN” reason for control to countries identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. To the extent consistent with United States national security and foreign policy interests, BIS will not approve applications for such licenses if the authorization would be contrary to the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution.

      (4) You may not use any License Exception, other than License Exception GOV, for items for personal or official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or agencies of cooperating governments as set forth in § 740.11(b) of the EAR, to export or reexport items with a UN reason for control to countries listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to Iraq, which is governed by § 746.3(c) of this part; North Korea, which is governed by § 746.4(c) of this part; or Iran, which is governed by § 746.7(c) of this part.

      (c)  The Russian Industry Sector Sanctions are set forth under § 746.5 and referenced under the License Requirements section of certain Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in supplement No. 1 to part 774 (Commerce Control List), as well as in a footnote to the Commerce Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738.

      (d) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State. Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BIS under the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activities maintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation of licensing responsibilities between BIS and these other agencies. References to the requirements of other agencies are informational; for current, complete, and authoritative requirements, you should consult the appropriate agency's regulations.

      § 746.2   Cuba.

#### § § 746.2

      (a)  As authorized by section 6 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) and by the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended, you will need a license to export or reexport all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR for the scope of items subject to the EAR) to Cuba, including any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to a Cuban national, except as follows:

      (1)  You may export or reexport without a license if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of the following License Exceptions. To determine the scope and eligibility requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or specific paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions). Read each License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed countries are generally narrow.

      (i) Temporary exports and reexports (TMP) by the news media (see § 740.9(a)(9) of the EAR).

      (ii) Operation technology and software (TSU) for legally exported commodities or software (see § 740.13(a) of the EAR).

      (iii) Sales technology (TSU) (see § 740.13(b) of the EAR).

      (iv) Software updates (TSU) for legally exported software (see § 740.13(c) of the EAR).

      (vii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see § 740.11 of the EAR).

      (viii) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see § 740.12 of the EAR).

      (ix) Items in transit (TMP) from Canada through the U.S. (see § 740.9(b)(1)(iv) of the EAR).

      (x) Aircraft, vessels and spacecraft (AVS) for certain aircraft on temporary sojourn; equipment and spare parts for permanent use on a vessel or aircraft, and ship and plane stores; vessels on temporary sojourn; or cargo transiting Cuba on aircraft or vessels on temporary sojourn ( § 740.15(a), (b), (d), and (e) of the EAR).

      (xi) Permissive reexports of certain spare parts in foreign-made equipment (see § 740.16(h) of the EAR).

      (xii) Exports of agricultural commodities, classified as EAR99, under License Exception Agricultural Commodities (AGR) and certain reexports of U.S. origin agricultural commodities, classified as EAR99, under License Exception AGR (see § 740.18 of the EAR).

      (xiii) Commodities and software authorized under License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) (see § 740.19 of the EAR).

      (xiv) License Exception Support for the Cuban People (SCP) ( § 740.21 of the EAR).

      (2)  A license is not required to release technology or source code subject to the EAR but not on the Commerce Control List ( EAR99 technology or source code) to a Cuban national in the United States or a third country.

      (b)  Items requiring a license are subject to a general policy of denial, except as follows:

      (1)  Applications to export medicines and medical devices as defined in part 772 of the EAR will generally be approved, except:

      (i) To the extent restrictions would be permitted under section 5(m) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA), or section 203(b)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act;

      (ii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be exported will be used for purposes of torture or other human rights abuses;

      (iii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be exported will be reexported;

      (iv) If the item to be exported could be used in the production of any biotechnological product; or

      (v) If it is determined that the United States government is unable to verify, by on-site inspection or other means, that the item to be exported will be used for the purpose for which it was intended and only for the use and benefit of the Cuban people, but this exception shall not apply to donations of medicines for humanitarian purposes to a nongovernmental organization in Cuba.

      (2)  Applications for licenses to export or reexport the following generally will be approved:

      (i) Telecommunications items that would improve communications to, from, and among the Cuban people;

      (ii) Commodities and software to human rights organizations or to individuals and non-governmental organizations that promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba;

This policy of case-by-case review includes applications for licenses to export or reexport items for:

      (A) Agricultural production, artistic endeavors (including the creation of public content, historic and cultural works and preservation), education, food processing, disaster preparedness, relief and response, public health and sanitation, residential construction and renovation and public transportation;

      (B) Wholesale and retail distribution for domestic consumption by the Cuban people;

      (C) Construction of facilities for treating public water supplies, facilities for supplying electricity or other energy to the Cuban people, sports and recreation facilities, and other infrastructure that directly benefits the Cuban people; and

      (D) Items that will enable or facilitate export from Cuba of items produced by the private sector.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (4)  Applications for exports or reexports of aircraft or vessels on temporary sojourn to Cuba, other than aircraft operated by certificated air carriers or cargo vessels for hire, are subject to a general policy of denial unless consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States. Applications for exports or reexports of aircraft operated by certificated air carriers or cargo vessels for hire on temporary sojourn to Cuba may be authorized on a case-by-case basis.

      (c)  For purposes of this section, “U.S. person” means any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, as described in § 515.329 of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 CFR 515.329).

      (d)  OFAC maintains controls on the activities of persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, wherever located, involving transactions with Cuba or any Cuban national, as provided in 31 CFR part 515. Exporters and reexporters should consult with OFAC for further guidance on its related controls.

      § 746.3   Iraq.

#### § § 746.3

      Pursuant to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions 1483 and 1546 and other relevant resolutions, the United Nations maintains an embargo on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel and their means of production, except items required by the Government of Iraq to serve the purposes of Resolution 1546. UNSC Resolutions 707 and 687 require that Iraq eliminate its nuclear weapons program and restrict its nuclear activities to the use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. Such resolutions further mandate that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its ballistic missile program. In support of the applicable UNSC resolutions, certain Iraq specific license requirements and licensing policies are detailed in this section. In addition, this section details restrictions on transfers of items subject to the EAR within Iraq. Exporters should be aware that other provisions of the EAR, including parts 742 and 744, will continue to apply with respect to exports and reexports to Iraq and transfers within Iraq.

      (a)  (1) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for NS, MT, NP, CW, CB, RS, CC, EI, SI, or SL reasons. See part 742 of the EAR.

      (2) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for UN reasons.

      (3) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items on the Commerce Control List controlled for RS reasons under the following ECCNs: 0B999, 0D999, 1B999, 1C992, 1C995, 1C997, 1C999 and 6A992.

      (4) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item subject to the EAR if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer, you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be, or is intended to be, used for a “military end-use” or by a “military end-user”, as defined in this section. This license requirement does not apply to exports, reexports or transfers of items for the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or exports, reexports or transfers to the Government of Iraq. See § 740.11(b)(3) of the EAR for the definition of “agency of the U.S. Government.” BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter, or other person, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer of items subject to the EAR to specified end-users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the uses or users described in this paragraph. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or other person from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph.

      (i)  In this section, the phrase “military end-use” means incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement website at ); or use, development, or deployment of military items described on the USML or the WAML.

      (ii)  In this section, the term “military end-user” means any “person” whose actions or functions are intended to support “military end-uses” as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and who is not recognized as a legitimate military organization by the U.S. Government.

      (5)  For purposes of exports or reexports to Iraq or transfers within Iraq, “ballistic missile” is defined as any missile capable of a range greater than 150 kilometers.

      (b)  (1) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section for Iraqi civil nuclear or military nuclear activity, except for use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes, will be subject to a policy of denial.

      (2) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of machine tools controlled for national security (NS) or nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, as well as for any items controlled for crime control (CC) or United Nations (UN) reasons (including items classified under ECCN 0A505.c) or ECCNs that end in the number “018” or items classified under “600 series” ECCNs, that would make a material contribution to the production, research, design, development, support, maintenance or manufacture of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles or arms and related materiel will be subject to a general policy of denial. Exports of “600 series” items to the Government of Iraq will be reviewed under the policies set forth for such items in §§ 742.4(b) and 742.6(b) of the EAR.

      (3) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if they would contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure. Applications determined not to contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure will be subject to a general policy of denial.

      (4) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will be subject to a policy of denial.

      (c)  You may export or reexport without a license if your transaction meets all the requirements of any of the following License Exceptions: CIV, APP, TMP, RPL, GOV, GFT, TSU, BAG, AVS, or ENC. For specific requirements of each of these License Exceptions, refer to part 740 of the EAR.

This requirement applies only to items subject to a license requirement under the EAR for export to Iraq as of July 30, 2004. These records must be maintained in accordance with recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR and must include the following information:

      (i) Date of export or reexport and related details (including means of transport);

      (ii) Description of items (including ECCN) and value of items in U.S. Dollars;

      (iii) Description of proposed end-use and locations in Iraq where items are intended to be used;

      (iv) Parties other than specific OFAC licensee who may be given temporary access to the items; and

      (v) Date of consumption or destruction, if the items are consumed or destroyed in the normal course of their use in Iraq, or the date of reexport to a third country not requiring further authorization from BIS, or return to the United States.

      (f) —(1)  A license is required for the transfer within Iraq of any item subject to the EAR exported or reexported pursuant to a specific license issued by the Department of the Treasury or a Department of Commerce specific license or License Exception.

      (2)  (i) A license is required for the transfer within Iraq of any item subject to the EAR, if, at the time of the transfer, you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be used in the design, development, production or use of weapons of mass destruction or the means of their delivery, as set forth in part 744 of the EAR.

      (ii) A license is required for the transfer within Iraq to designated terrorists or terrorist organizations, as set forth in § 744.12, § 744.13, or § 744.14 of the EAR.

#### § § 746.5

      § 746.6   Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine and covered regions of Ukraine.

#### § § 746.6

      (a) —(1)  (i) A license is required to export or reexport to or transfer within the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine any item subject to the EAR other than food and medicine designated as EAR99, or 'software necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet'; and

      (ii) Except as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a license is required to reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to any destination any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under the Russia/Belarus/Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine FDP rule described in § 734.9(f) of the EAR.

      (2)  A license is required to export or reexport to, or transfer within, the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine any item subject to the EAR other than: Food and medicine designated as EAR99, or 'software necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the internet'.

      (3)  For purposes of applying the EAR deemed export and deemed reexport requirements pursuant to the general prohibitions described in this paragraph (a)(3), the nationality of the foreign national (as determined by accepted methods, such as looking to the passport or other nationality document(s) recognized by the United States Government) is what is used for purposes of determining whether a license is required for a deemed export or deemed reexport.

      (4)  The countries listed in supplement No. 3 to this part have committed to implementing substantially similar export controls on Russia and Belarus under their domestic laws. Therefore, exports or reexports from the countries listed in supplement No. 3 to this part or transfers (in-country) within the countries listed in this supplement are not subject to the license requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) of this section, unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the Scope column in supplement no. 3 to this part.

      (5)  The license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to exports, reexports, and transfers (in country) used in or for deployments by the Government of Ukraine to or within the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine or covered regions of Ukraine.

      (b)  With limited exceptions, applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item that requires a license pursuant to the requirements of this section will be reviewed with a policy of denial.

In reviewing such applications, whether the transaction in question would benefit the Russian or Belarusian government or defense sector or would otherwise be detrimental to the country or people of Ukraine are factors that will be taken into consideration.

      (c)  You may export, reexport or transfer (in-country) without a license if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of the license exception paragraphs specified in this paragraph (c). To determine scope and eligibility requirements, you will need to refer to the sections or specific paragraphs of part 740 (License Exceptions) of the EAR, as well as § 740.2 license exception restrictions. Read each license exception carefully, as the provisions available for countries subject to sanctions are generally narrow.

      (1) TMP for items for use by the news media as set forth in § 740.9(a)(9) of the EAR.

      (2) GOV for items for personal or official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), or the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) as set forth in § 740.11(a) and (b)(2) of the EAR.

      (6) AVS for civil aircraft and vessels as set forth in § 740.15(a)(4) and (d) of the EAR.

      (7) License Exception MED (§ 740.23 of the EAR).

      (d)  For purpose of this section, use the following definitions of terms:

      (1) 'Crimea region of Ukraine' includes the land territory in that region as well as any maritime area over which sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction is claimed based on occupation of that land territory.

      (2) 'Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) region' or 'Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) region' include the land territory in those regions as well as any maritime area over which sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction is claimed based on purported sovereignty over that land territory or area.

      § 746.7   Iran.

#### § § 746.7

      The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers a comprehensive trade and investment embargo against Iran. This embargo includes prohibitions on exports and certain reexport transactions involving Iran, including transactions dealing with items subject to the EAR. These prohibitions are set forth in OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations (31 CFR part 560). In addition, BIS maintains licensing requirements on exports and reexports to or from Iran under the EAR as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or elsewhere in the EAR ( § 742.8).

      (a) —(1) —(i)  A license is required under the EAR to export or reexport to Iran any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1, CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 2, CC Column 3, AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart Column of the _License Requirements_ section of an ECCN or classified under ECCNs 0A503, 0A980, 0A982, 0A983, 0E982, 1C355, 1C395, 1C980, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) or 5E980.

      (ii)  A license is required under the EAR to export or reexport to Iran any item identified in supplement no. 7 to part 746 of the EAR when such item is subject to the EAR for any reason other than § 734.9(j) of the EAR.

      (iii)  Except as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, a license is required to reexport or export from abroad to, or transfer (in-country) within Iran any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under the Iran FDP rule that is located in or destined to Iran. A Department of Commerce license is not required for transactions described in this paragraph (a)(1)(iii) that would have otherwise met all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license or other authorization if the transactions had been subject to OFAC jurisdiction.

      (iv)  (A) Exports from abroad or reexports from the countries described in supplement no. 3 to this part are not subject to the license requirements described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the “Scope” column in supplement no. 3 to this part.

      (B) An item is excluded from license requirements under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section if the item is any of the following:

      () Food, “medicine,” or “medical devices” designated as EAR99;

      () Necessary and ordinarily incident to communications, designated as EAR99 or specified in ECCN 5A99_2_.c or 5D992.c, and classified in accordance with § 740.17 of the EAR; and would otherwise meet all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license or other authorization if the transaction were subject to OFAC jurisdiction.

      (v)  For purposes of determining U.S.-origin controlled content under supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR when making a  calculation for reexports and exports from a country described in supplement no. 3 to this part to Iran, the license requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section are not used to determine controlled U.S.-origin content in a foreign-made item, provided the U.S.-origin content is identified in supplement no. 7 to this part and is designated EAR99 and is not otherwise excluded from the applicable “Scope” column in supplement no. 3 to this part.

      (2)  To avoid duplication, exporters or reexporters are not required to seek separate authorization from BIS for an export or reexport subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or reexport, such authorization is considered authorization for purposes of the EAR as well. Transactions that are not subject to OFAC regulatory authority may require _BIS authorization._

      (b)  Applications for licenses for transactions for humanitarian reasons or for the safety of civil aviation and safe operation of U.S-origin aircraft will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Licenses for other purposes generally will be denied.

      (c)  No license exceptions may be used for exports or reexports to Iran.

      (d)  The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Anti-terrorism license requirements and licensing policy regarding Iran are set forth in § 742.8 of the EAR.

      (e)  No person may export or reexport any item that is subject to the EAR if such transaction is prohibited by the Iranian Transactions Regulations (31 CFR part 560) and not authorized by OFAC. The prohibition of this paragraph (e) applies whether or not the EAR requires a license for the export or reexport.

      § 746.8   Sanctions against Russia and Belarus.

#### § § 746.8

      (a)  Except as described in the exclusions in paragraph (a)(12), and in addition to license requirements specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and in other provisions of the EAR, including part 744 and other sections of part 746, a license is required as specified under paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. These license requirements follow an order of review, which provides guidance on the relationship between the different license requirements and which ones take precedence for certain items. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(5) through (7) of this section, a license is not required for any item that is listed in supplement nos. 4, 5 or 6 to this part that is also classified under an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR.  paragraph (a)(1) of this section and part 742 for license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers to or within Russia or Belarus for items classified in ECCNs, as well as part 744 for end-use and end-user controls that may apply to your transaction. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, are also used for determining license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers to or within Russia or Belarus of any item that is listed in supplement nos. 4, 5, or 6 to this part and is classified in an ECCN on the CCL in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. License requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that apply to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) involved in certain end uses should be reviewed only after license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) and (5) through (8) of this section are reviewed.

      (1)  A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Russia or Belarus any item subject to the EAR and specified in any Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the CCL.

      (2)  A license is required to reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to any destination any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under the Russia/Belarus/Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine under the FDP rule described in § 734.9(f) of the EAR.

      (3)  A license is required to reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to or within any destination or to any end user or party any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under § 734.9(g) of the EAR.

      (4) —(i)  A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part and items specified in ECCNs 0A998, 1C992, 3A229, 3A231, 3A232, 6A991, 8A992, and 8D999 when you “know” that the item will be used directly or indirectly in exploration for, or production of, oil or gas in Russian deepwater (greater than 500 feet) or Arctic offshore locations or shale formations in Russia or Belarus, or are unable to determine whether the item will be used in such projects. Such items include, but are not limited to, drilling rigs, parts for horizontal drilling, drilling and completion equipment, subsea processing equipment, Arctic-capable marine equipment, wireline and down hole motors and equipment, drill pipe and casing, software for hydraulic fracturing, high pressure pumps, seismic acquisition equipment, remotely operated vehicles, compressors, expanders, valves, and risers.

      (ii)  BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a specific export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) or for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain end-user or end-use, because there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the activities specified in this section in Russia or Belarus. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by either the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance with the license requirements of this section.

      (5)  A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 4 to this part to or within Russia or Belarus.

      (6)  A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 6 to this part to or within Russia or Belarus.

      (7)  A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 5 to this part to or within Russia or Belarus.

      (8)  (i) A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Russia or Belarus any “software” subject to the EAR and described in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section.

      (ii) The following types of software subject to the EAR are in the scope of paragraph (a)(8): Enterprise resource planning (ERP); customer relationship management (CRM); business intelligence (BI); supply chain management (SCM); enterprise data warehouse (EDW); computerized maintenance management system (CMMS); project management software, product lifecycle management (PLM); building information modelling (BIM); computer aided design (CAD); computer-aided manufacturing (CAM); engineering to order (ETO); and software for the operation of computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. The scope of paragraph (a)(8) also includes software updates for software identified in this paragraph that are subject to the EAR and designated as EAR99.

      (9)-(11) [Reserved]

      (12)  Paragraphs (a)(12)(i), (ii), and (iii)(A) of this section exclude certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) from the scope of the license requirements of this section. Paragraph (a)(12)(iii)(B) excludes certain items from the scope of U.S.-origin content for purposes of  calculations from certain destinations.

      (i)  The license requirements in paragraph (a) do not apply to deemed exports or reexports. However, the exclusion for deemed exports and deemed reexports is limited to the license requirements specified only in this section of the EAR. Any deemed export or deemed reexport to a Russian or Belarusian national must be made in accordance with all other applicable EAR license requirements, such as CCL-based license requirements. For example, the release of NS1 controlled technology to a Russian or Belarusian national in the United States or in a third country would require a CCL-based deemed export or deemed reexport license (as applicable). Consequently, authorization (in the form of a deemed export or deemed reexport license, or license exception eligibility) would be required under the EAR notwithstanding the exclusion in this paragraph (b).

      (ii)  Commodities specified under ECCN 5A991, and commodities and software classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5D992.c that have been 'classified in accordance with § 740.17,' as well as software designated EAR99 and identified in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section do not require a license to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Russia or Belarus for the following civil end-users:

      (A) Wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices;

      (B) Joint ventures between two or more U.S. companies, including the wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of such joint ventures;

      (C) Joint ventures between U.S. companies and companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, including the wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of such joint ventures;

      (D) Wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740;

      (E) Joint ventures between two _or_ more companies headquartered in Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740, including the wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of such joint ventures;

      (F) For official business of diplomatic or consular missions of the governments of Country Group A:5 and A:6 destinations.

      (iii)  The countries listed in supplement no. 3 to this part have committed to implementing substantially similar export controls on Russia, Belarus, and the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine under their domestic laws. Therefore, exports or reexports from the countries listed in supplement no. 3 to this part or transfers (in-country) within the countries listed in this supplement are not subject to the following license requirements in paragraph (a) of this section unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the Scope column in supplement no. 3 to this part:

      (A)  The license requirement described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section;

      (B)  For purposes of determining U.S.-origin controlled content under supplement no. _2_ to part 734 of the EAR, when making a  calculation for reexports and exports from abroad to Russia or Belarus, the license requirements in paragraphs (a)(_1_) and (a)(4) through (7) of this section are not used to determine controlled U.S.-origin content in a foreign-made item, provided the criteria of paragraphs (a)(12)(B)() and () of this section are met:

      () The U.S.-origin content is described in an Anti-Terrorism (AT)-only ECCN or is designated EAR99. For purposes of this paragraph, AT-only items mean any ECCN that only specifies either only AT in the reason for control paragraph of the ECCN or is classified under ECCN 9A99_1_;

      () The foreign made item will be reexported or exported from abroad from a destination described in supplement no. 3 to this part.

      (iv)  Software that is subject to the EAR and designated EAR99 is excluded from the license requirement in paragraph (a)(8) when destined to entities engaged exclusively in the agriculture or medical industries.

      (b)  (1) License applications required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be reviewed under a policy of denial in all cases.

      (2) Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section that require a license for Russia or Belarus will be reviewed under a policy of denial when for use directly or indirectly for exploration or production from deepwater (greater than 500 feet), Arctic offshore, or shale projects in Russia or Belarus that have the potential to produce oil or gas.

      (3) Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (a)(5) through (8) of this section will be reviewed under a policy of denial. However, the following types of license applications submitted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (4) through (8) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the transaction in question would benefit the Russian or Belarusian government or defense sector:

      (i) Applications for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of items that may be necessary for health and safety reasons, including the safety of flight, maritime safety, and civil nuclear safety;

      (ii) Applications for the disposition of items by companies not headquartered in Country Group D:1, D:5, E:1, or E:2 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 that are winding down or closing all operations in Russia or Belarus;

      (iii) Applications for items that meet humanitarian needs, including applications for items that are predominantly agricultural or medical in nature;

      (iv) Applications for government-to-government activities or to support government space cooperation;

      (v) Replacement licenses for exports and reexports to and transfers within Russia and Belarus of items described in HTS-6 Codes or items described in supplement no. 6 to part 746 that were added to the EAR and made subject to license requirements after the validation date of the BIS license.

      (vi) Applications for items destined to:

      (A) Wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices;

      (B) Foreign subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of U.S. companies that are joint ventures with other U.S. companies;

      (C) Joint ventures of U.S. companies with companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR;

      (D) The wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740;

      (E) Joint ventures of companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6 with other companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6;

      (F) For official business of governments of Country Group A:5 and A:6 destinations.

      (vii) Applications for companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6 to support civil telecommunications infrastructure.

      (c)  Consistent with § 740.2(b), BIS may revise, suspend, or revoke License Exception availability under this section consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, including on a case-by-case basis, to prevent Russian or Belarusian persons from circumventing the restrictions in this section.

      (1) No license exceptions may overcome the license requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except as specified in the entry for a Footnote 3 entity on the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 of the EAR.

      (2) No license exceptions may overcome the license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (4) through (8) of this section except the following:

      (ii) License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) of the EAR) may overcome the license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (4) through (7) of this section. License Exception GOV under (§ 740.11(e) of the EAR) may overcome the license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for ECCN 9A004.

      (iii) License Exception TSU for software updates for civil end-users that are wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices; foreign subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of U.S. companies that are joint ventures with other U.S. companies; joint ventures of U.S. companies with companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR countries; the wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches, or sales offices of companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740; or joint ventures of companies headquartered in Country Group A:5 and A:6 with other companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6 (§ 740.13(c) of the EAR).

      (iv) License Exception BAG, excluding firearms and ammunition (§ 740.14, excluding paragraph (e), of the EAR).

      (v) License Exception AVS, excluding any aircraft registered in, owned or controlled by, or under charter or lease by Russia or Belarus or a national of Russia or Belarus (§ 740.15(a) and (b) of the EAR).

      § 746.9   Syria.

#### § § 746.9

      Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(a)(2)(A) of the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-175, codified as a note to 22 U.S.C. 2151) (the SAA) require a prohibition on the export to Syria of all items on the Commerce Control List (in 15 CFR part 774) (CCL) and a prohibition on the export to Syria of products of the United States, other than food and medicine. The President also exercised national security waiver authority pursuant to Section 5(b) of the SAA for certain transactions. The provisions in this section were issued consistent with Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004 which implemented the SAA.

      (a)  A license is required for the export or reexport to Syria of all items subject to the EAR, except food and medicine classified as EAR99 (food and medicine are defined in part 772 of the EAR). A license is required for the deemed export and deemed reexport, as described in §§ 734.13(b) and 734.14(b) of the EAR, respectively, of any technology or source code on the Commerce Control List (CCL) to a Syrian foreign national. Deemed exports and deemed reexports to Syrian foreign nationals involving technology or source code subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL do not require a license.

      (b)  No License Exceptions to the license requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are available for exports or reexports to Syria, except the following:

      (1) TMP for items for use by the news media as set forth in § 740.9(a)(9) of the EAR,

      (2) GOV for items for personal or official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government as set forth in § 740.11(b)(2) of the EAR,

      (3) TSU for operation technology and software, sales technology, and software updates pursuant to the terms of § 740.13(a), (b), or (c) of the EAR,

      (4) BAG for exports of personally-owned items by individuals leaving the United States as personal baggage pursuant to the terms of § 740.14(a) through (d), only, of the EAR, and

      (5) AVS for the temporary sojourn of civil aircraft reexported to Syria pursuant to the terms of § 740.15(a)(4) of the EAR.

      (c)  (1) Except as described in this paragraph (c), all license applications for export or reexport to Syria are subject to a general policy of denial. License applications for “deemed exports” and “deemed reexports” of technology and source code will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. BIS may consider, on a case-by-case basis, license applications for exports and reexports of items necessary to carry out the President's constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign affairs and as Commander-in-Chief, including exports and reexports of items necessary for the performance of official functions by the United States Government personnel abroad.

      (2) BIS may also consider the following license applications on a case-by-case basis: items in support of activities, diplomatic or otherwise, of the United States Government (to the extent that regulation of such exportation or reexportation would not fall within the President's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs); medicine (on the CCL) and medical devices (both as defined in part 772 of the EAR); parts and components intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft; aircraft chartered by the Syrian Government for the transport of Syrian Government officials on official Syrian Government business; telecommunications equipment and associated computers, software and technology; items in support of United Nations operations in Syria; and items necessary for the support of the Syrian people, including, but not limited to, items related to water supply and sanitation, agricultural production and food processing, power generation, oil and gas production, construction and engineering, transportation, and educational infrastructure. The total dollar value of each approved license for aircraft parts for flight safety normally will be limited to no more than $2 million over the 24-month standard license term, except in the case of complete overhauls.

      (3) In addition, consistent with part 734 of the EAR, the following are not subject to the EAR and therefore not subject to this General Order: informational materials in the form of books and other media; publicly available software and technology; and technology exported in the form of a patent application or an amendment, modification, or supplement thereto or a division thereof (see 15 CFR 734.3(b)(1)(v), (b)(2) and (b)(3)).

      § 748.1   General provisions.

#### § § 748.1

      (a)  In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations or EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The provisions of this part involve requests for classifications and advisory opinions, export license applications, reexport license applications, and certain license exception notices subject to the EAR. All terms, conditions, provisions, and instructions, including the applicant and consignee certifications, contained in electronic or paper form(s) are incorporated as part of the EAR. For the purposes of this part, the term “application” refers to both electronic applications and the Form BIS-748P: Multipurpose Application.

      (b)  BIS will give a formal classification, advisory opinion or licensing decision only through the review of a properly completed application supported by all relevant facts and required documentation submitted in writing or electronically to BIS.

      (c)  Consistent with section 12(c) of the Export Administration Act, as amended, information obtained for the purpose of considering license applications, and other information obtained by the U.S. Department of Commerce concerning license applications, will not be made available to the public without the approval of the Secretary of Commerce or of the Under Secretary for Industry and Security.

      (d)  All export and reexport license applications, License Exception AGR notifications, requests to authorize use of License Exception STA for “600 series” end items (which are currently submitted as export license applications) and classification requests and their accompanying documents must be filed via BIS's Simplified Network Application Processing system (SNAP-R), unless BIS authorizes submission via the paper forms BIS 748-P (Multipurpose Application Form), BIS-748P-A (Item Appendix) and BIS-748P-B, (End-User Appendix). Only original paper forms may be used. Facsimiles or reproductions are not acceptable.

      (1)  BIS will process paper applications notices or requests if the submitting party meets one or more of the following criteria:

      (i) BIS has received no more than one submission ( the total number of export license applications, reexport license applications, license exception AGR notifications,  classification requests) from that party in the twelve months immediately preceding its receipt of the current submission;

      (ii) The party does not have access to the Internet;

      (iii) BIS has rejected the party's electronic filing registration or revoked its eligibility to file electronically;

      (iv) BIS has requested that the party submit a paper copy for a particular transaction; or

      (v) BIS has determined that urgency, a need to implement U.S. government policy or a circumstance outside the submitting party's control justify allowing paper submissions in a particular instance.

      (2)  The applicant must state in Block 24 or as an attachment to the paper application (Form BIS 748-P) which of the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section it meets and the facts that support such statement. Submit the completed application, notification or request to Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania, NW., Room 2099B, Washington DC 20230.

      (3)  If BIS authorizes or requires paper filing pursuant to this section, it will process the application, notification or request in accordance with part 750 of the EAR. If BIS rejects a request to file using paper, it will return the Form BIS-748P and all attachments to the submitting party without action and will state the reason for its decision.

      § 748.3   Classification requests and advisory opinions.

#### § § 748.3

      (a)  You may ask BIS to provide you with the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) down to the paragraph (or subparagraph) level, if appropriate. BIS will issue you a determination that each item identified in your classification request is either described by an ECCN in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR or not described by an ECCN and, therefore, an “EAR99” item. These classification determinations issued by BIS are not U.S. Government determinations that the items described therein are “subject to the EAR,” as this term is defined in § 734.3 of the EAR. Those who request commodity classifications and advisory opinions should have determined that the items at issue are not subject to the exclusive export control jurisdiction of one of the other U.S. Government agencies listed in § 734.3(b) of the EAR. If requested, for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BIS will advise you whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for a particular transaction. Note that these responses do not bind BIS to issuing a license in the future. This type of request, along with requests for guidance regarding other interpretations of the EAR, is commonly referred to as an “Advisory Opinion.” The encryption provisions in the EAR require the submission of a classification request in accordance with § 740.17(d) of the EAR in order for certain items to be eligible for export and reexport under License Exception ENC (see § 740.17 of the EAR) or to be released from “EI” controls (see §§ 740.17(b)(2) and 740.17(b)(3) of the EAR).

      (b)  Submit classification requests in accordance with the procedures in § 748.1.

      (1) Each Classification Request must be limited to six items. Exceptions may be granted by BIS on a case-by-case basis for several related items if the relationship between the items is satisfactorily substantiated in the request. Classification requests must be supported by any descriptive literature, brochures, precise technical specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to enable classification by BIS submitted as PDF files attached to the SNAP-R submission unless a paper submission is authorized pursuant to § 748.1 of the EAR.

      (2) When submitting a classification request, you must complete Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22(a), (b), (c), (d), and (i), 24, and 25 on the application. You must provide a recommended classification in Block 22(a) and explain the basis for your recommendation based on the technical parameters specified in the appropriate ECCN in Block 24. If you are unable to determine a recommended classification for your item, include an explanation in Block 24, identifying the ambiguities or deficiencies that precluded you from making a recommended classification.

      (3) BIS assigns each of its commodity classifications a Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System (CCATS) number. Neither the BIS classification nor the CCATS number may be relied upon or cited as evidence that the U.S. Government has determined that the items described in the commodity classification determination are subject to the EAR (See 15 CFR 734.3).

      (c)  Advisory opinion requests must be made in writing, and may be delivered to BIS by mail, by email, or through the BIS website. If delivering a request by mail, submit to the address listed in § 748.1(d)(2). Both your letter and envelope must be marked “Advisory Opinion.” If submitting by email, submit to  with the subject title “Advisory Opinion.” If submitting through the BIS website, see

      (1) Your submission must contain the following information if you are requesting guidance regarding interpretations of the EAR:

      (i) The name, title, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the person to contact,

      (ii) Your complete address comprised of street address, city, state, country, and postal code; and

      (2) If you are requesting BIS to determine whether a license is required, or the licensing policy related to a particular end-use, end-user, and/or destination, in addition to the information required in § 748.3(c)(1) you must also include:

      (i) All available information on the parties to the transaction and the proposed end-use or end-user,

      (ii) The model number for each item, where appropriate,

      (iii) The Export Control Classification Number, if known, for each item; and

      (iv) Any descriptive literature, brochures, technical specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to enable BIS to verify the correct classification.

      (3) Requests for Validated End-User authorization should be submitted in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 748.15 and supplement nos. 8 and 9 to this part.

      (4) To request an addition or modification to or removal from the approved integrated circuit designers list in supplement no. 6 to part 740 of the EAR or the approved “OSAT” companies list in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, see § 748.16 of this part.

      (5) Advisory opinions are limited in scope to BIS's interpretation of EAR provisions. Advisory opinions differ from commodity classifications in that advisory opinions are not limited to the interpretation of provisions contained in the Commerce Control List. Advisory opinions may not be relied upon or cited as evidence that the U.S. Government has determined that the items described in the advisory opinion are not subject to the export control jurisdiction of another agency of the U.S. Government (See 15 CFR 734.3).

      (d)  A classification request associated with encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List consistent with Executive Order 13026 of November 15, 1996 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 228) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date may be required to determine eligibility under License Exception ENC or for release from “EI” controls. Refer to supplement no. 6 to part 742 of the EAR for a complete list of technical information that is required for encryption classification requests. Refer to § 740.17(e)(3) and supplement no. 8 to part 742 of the EAR for information that is required to be submitted in a self-classification report. Refer to § 740.17(b) of the EAR for instructions regarding mass market encryption commodities and software, including self-classifications and classification requests. Refer to § 740.17 of the EAR for the provisions of License Exception ENC, including encryption self-classifications, classification requests and sales reporting. All classification requests, notifications and reports submitted to BIS pursuant to §§ 740.17 and 742.15(b) of the EAR will be reviewed by the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator, Ft. Meade, MD.

      (e) —(1)  If you have a “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” that is “specially designed” on the basis of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of the “specially designed” definition in § 772.1 of the EAR, you may submit a request in accordance with the procedures in § 748.1 to confirm that the item is not “specially designed” provided you meet the following criteria:

      (i) The “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” does not meet the criteria of exclusion paragraph (b)(3) of the “specially designed” definition, but would meet the criteria if the minor changes in form or fit were determined to be insignificant by the U.S. Government.

      (ii) The performance capabilities of the “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” are the same as those of a “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” that would meet the criteria of exclusion paragraph (b)(3) of the definition of “specially designed” in § 772.1 of the EAR.

      (2)  Applicants wishing to submit a CCATS requesting confirmation that a “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is not “specially designed” must submit classification requests in accordance with the procedures in § 748.1 and general provisions regarding submitting classification requests in § 748.3(b). In addition, applicants must submit additional information identified in this paragraph (e)(2).

      (i) The classification request must indicate in Block 24 or in a separate PDF attachment included with the CCATS submission that the “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment” or “software” would meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;

      (ii) A detailed explanation must be provided regarding all changes in form _and_ fit;

      (iii) A rationale must be provided that explains why such changes in form and fit should be treated as minor or insignificant in terms of their role in the performance capabilities of the enumerated item.

      (3)  Commodity classification requests submitted pursuant to § 748.3(e) are reviewed by the Departments of Commerce, State and Defense. A consensus determination is required to confirm that a “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is not “specially designed” on the basis of this paragraph. The interagency review process will ensure U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are evaluated prior to any confirmation pursuant to § 748.3(e). The interagency review will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a particular “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is “specially designed” taking into account all the following:

      (i) The insignificance of the changes in form and fit;

      (ii) The overall role of the “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” in the performance capabilities of the enumerated or otherwise described item that it is used in or with;

      (iii) How substantively common it is to the other “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” that would meet the paragraph (b)(3) criteria;

      (iv) Whether such a confirmation would be consistent with U.S. Government multilateral export control regime commitments;

      (v) Any other criteria that may be relevant in determining whether the “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is “specially designed,” including an evaluation of how such a confirmation may affect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

      (4)  The BIS response to the CCATS request will reflect the interagency consensus determination and the response will be made in accordance with the procedures in §§ 748.1 and 748.3(b). In addition, the BIS response will indicate one of the following:

      (i) The “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is not “specially designed” on the basis of being within the scope of paragraph (b)(3) because the changes in form and fit have been determined by the U.S. Government to be minor or insignificant. In such cases, the new classification, which may be EAR99 or in another ECCN entry that does not use “specially designed,” will be provided as part of the BIS response;”

      (ii) The request under § 748.3(e) has been denied and the “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” continues to be classified under a “specially designed” ‘catch-all’ (see the definition of “specially designed” in § 772.1 of the EAR). The response will also include a determination regarding where the “specially designed” “part,” “component,” “accessory,” “attachment,” or “software” is classified on the CCL; or

      (iii) Returned without action (RWA) because insufficient information was provided or information was not provided in a timely fashion. These requests will be reviewed closely, and they will likely require additional follow up questions of applicants, so responding to such requests in a timely fashion will be an important part of the process to ensure such requests are considered by the U.S. Government.

      (f)  Classification requests may be submitted to confirm that technology is not controlled under ECCN 4E091 because the artificial intelligence model has been trained utilizing fewer computational 'operations' than the number needed to train a model as capable, according to an average of widely used benchmarks, as the most advanced artificial intelligence model that has been “published” as defined in § 734.7(a) of the EAR. Refer to the technical notes to ECCN 4E091 for instructions regarding self-classifications of artificial intelligence models.

      § 748.4   Basic guidance related to applying for a license.

#### § § 748.4

      (a) —(1)  Only a person in the United States may apply for a license to export items from the United States. The applicant must be the exporter, who is the U.S. principal party in interest with the authority to determine and control the sending of items out of the United States, except for Encryption License Arrangements (ELA) (see § 750.7(d) of the EAR). See definition of “exporter” in part 772 of the EAR.

      (2)  The U.S. principal party in interest or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest may apply for a license to export items from the United States. Prior to submitting an application, the agent that applies for a license on behalf of the foreign principal party in interest must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal party in interest. See § 758.3(b) and (d) of the EAR.

      (3)  The U.S. or foreign principal party in interest, or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest, may apply for a license to reexport controlled items from one country to another. Prior to submitting an application, an agent that applies for a license on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest must obtain a power-of-attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal party in interest, unless there is a preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of responsibility or affiliation. See power-of-attorney requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (b) —(1)  License applicants must disclose the names and addresses of all parties to a transaction. When the applicant is the U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest, the applicant must disclose the fact of the agency relationship, and the name and address of the agent's principal. If there is any doubt about which persons should be named as parties to the transaction, the applicant should disclose the names of all such persons and the functions to be performed by each in Block 24 of the application. Note that when the foreign principal party in interest is the ultimate consignee or end-user, the name and address need not be repeated in Block 24. See “Parties to the transaction” in § 748.5.

      (2) —(i)  An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization from the principal party in interest, unless there is a preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of responsibility or affiliation, prior to preparing or submitting an application for a license, when acting as either:

      (A) An agent, applicant, licensee and exporter for a foreign principal party in interest in a routed transaction; or

      (B) An agent who prepares an application for export on behalf of a U.S. principal party in interest who is the actual applicant, licensee and exporter in an export transaction.

      (ii)  Block 7 of the application (documents on file with applicant) must be marked “other” and Block 24 (Additional information) must be marked “748.4(b)(2)” to indicate that the power of attorney or other written authorization is on file with the agent. See § 758.3(d) for power of attorney requirement, and see also part 762 of the EAR for recordkeeping requirements.

      (c)  No person subject to a denial order based on a conviction for a violation of any statute specified at 50 U.S.C. 4819(e)(1)(B) may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. The duration of the prohibition shall be included as a term of the denial order. See § 766.25 of the EAR.

      (d)  If you have obtained a license without disclosure of the facts described in this section, the license will be deemed to have been obtained without disclosure of all facts material to the granting of the license and the license so obtained will be deemed void. See part 764 of the EAR for other sanctions that may result in the event a violation occurs.

      (1)  If you submit a license application for items that you know have been detained or seized by the Office of Export Enforcement or by the U.S. Customs Service, you must disclose this fact to BIS when you submit your license application.

      (2)  You may not submit a license application to BIS covering a shipment that is already laden aboard the exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export or reexport should not have been made without first securing a license authorizing the shipment, you must send a letter of explanation to the Office of Export Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., H4520, Washington, D.C., 20230. The letter must state why a license was not obtained and disclose all facts concerning the shipment that would normally have been disclosed on the license application. You will be informed of any action and furnished any instructions by the Office of Export Enforcement.

      (e)  Your license application need not be limited to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimate of items to be shipped throughout the validity of the license. Do not wait until the license you are using expires before submitting a new application. You may submit a new application prior to the expiration of your current license in order to ensure uninterrupted shipping.

      (f)  You may not submit a second license application covering the same proposed transaction while the first is pending action by BIS.

      (g)  If a license application is returned without action to you by BIS or your application represents a transaction previously denied by BIS, and you want to resubmit the license application, a new license application must be completed in accordance with the instructions contained in supplement no. 1 to part 748. Cite the Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24 on the new license application.

      (h)  Applicants may request emergency processing of license applications by contacting the Outreach and Educational Services Division of the Office of Exporter Services by telephone on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-2927. Refer to the Application Control Number when making emergency processing requests. BIS will expedite its evaluation, and attempt to expedite the evaluations of other government agencies, of a license application when, in its sole judgement, the circumstances justify emergency processing. See § 750.7(g) of the EAR for the limit on the validity period of emergency licenses.

      § 748.5   Parties to the transaction.

#### § § 748.5

      The following parties may be entered on the application. The definitions, which also appear in part 772 of the EAR, are set out here for your convenience to assist you in filling out your application correctly.

      (a)  The person who applies for an export or reexport license, and who has the authority of a principal party in interest to determine and control the export or reexport of items. See § 748.4(a) and definition of “exporter” in part 772 of the EAR.

      (b)  The person authorized by the applicant to receive the license. If a person and address is listed in Block 15 of the application, the Bureau of Industry and Security will send the license to that person instead of the applicant. Designation of another party to receive the license does not alter the responsibilities of the applicant, licensee or exporter.

      (c)  The person abroad who has entered into the transaction to purchase an item for delivery to the ultimate consignee. In most cases, the purchaser is not a bank, forwarding agent, or intermediary. The purchaser and ultimate consignee may be the same entity.

      (d)  The person that acts as an agent for a principal party in interest and takes possession of the items for the purpose of effecting delivery of the items to the ultimate consignee. The intermediate consignee may be a bank, forwarding agent, or other person who acts as an agent for a principal party in interest.

      (e)  The principal party in interest located abroad who receives the exported or reexported items. The ultimate consignee is not a forwarding agent or other intermediary, but may be the end-user.

      (f)  The person abroad that receives and ultimately uses the exported or reexported items. The end-user is not a forwarding agent or intermediary, but may be the purchaser or ultimate consignee.

      § 748.6   General instructions for license applications.

#### § § 748.6

      (a)  (1) General instructions for filling out license applications are in supplement no. 1 to this part.

      (2) License applications may require additional information due to the type of items requested in the application or the characteristics of the transaction. Special instructions for applications requiring such additional information are listed in § 748.8 and described fully in supplement no. 2 to this part.

      (3) License applications may also require additional information for evaluation of the parties in the transaction. Special instructions for applications requiring such additional information are listed in §§ 748.9 through 748.13.

      (b)  Each application has an application control number.The Application Control Number, consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for use by BIS when processing applications, and by applicants when communicating with BIS concerning pending applications. This number is used for tracking purposes within the U.S. Government. The Application Control Number is not a license number.

      (c)  License applications may be approved in whole or in part, denied in whole or in part, or returned without action. However, you may specifically request that your license application be considered as a whole and either approved or denied in its entirety.

      (d)  Any items may be combined on a single application, however, if the items differ dramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BIS offices to which a license application may be referred for review may increase significantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items on each license application to those that are similar and/or related.

      (e)  Documents required to be submitted with applications filed via SNAP-R must be submitted as PDF files using the procedures described in SNAP-R. Documents required to be submitted with paper applications must bear the application control number to which they relate and, if applicable, be stapled to the paper form. Where necessary, BIS may require you to submit additional information beyond that stated in the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in your license application.

      (f)  Answers to all items on the license application will be deemed to be continuing representations of the existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change in the terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction, must be promptly reported to BIS, whether a license has been granted or the license application is still under consideration. If a license has been granted and such changes are not excepted in § 750.7(c) of the EAR, they must be reported immediately to BIS, even though shipments against the license may be partially or wholly completed, during the validity period of the license.

      (g)  An extended validity period will generally be granted if your transaction is related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not permit export or reexport during the normal validity period or for other similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. To request an extended validity period, include justification for your request in Block 24 on the application.

      § 748.7   Registering for electronic submission of license applications and related documents.

#### § § 748.7

      (a)  This section describes the procedures for registering to submit electronic documents to BIS. The procedures in this section apply to submission of export and reexport license applications, classification requests, and License Exception AGR notifications.

      (b)  Parties wishing to submit electronically must log on to  to register. Upon initial registration, the party (the filing entity) will have to supply the name of the entity that will be submitting documents electronically and its address and the name, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address of the person who will act as account administrator. The person will be required to certify that the information so supplied is correct and complete, that the person has authority to register the entity that will be making electronic submissions and that the person has authority to act as an account administrator for that entity.

      (c)  The account administrator is able to add and remove individual users to and from the account of the filing entity for which it is the account administrator. The account administrator can also make individual users account administrators and can terminate an individual user's administrator status. The account administrator can deactivate the account of an individual user and reactivate the account of a previously deactivated individual user. The account administrator can update the filing entity's identifying information such as name and address and any individual user's identifying information such as name, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address. The account administrator can reset individual users' passwords.

      (d)  An individual user may submit to BIS export and reexport license applications, classification requests, and License Exception AGR notifications.

      (e)  BIS may refuse to accept an electronic submission if it has reason to believe that the individual user making the submission lacks authority to do so. However, BIS is not obligated to conduct any checks to determine whether an individual user has the necessary authority and will generally treat users as acting within their authority. Acting through their account administrators, parties have the ability to remove an individual user when that individual user is no longer authorized to make submissions on behalf of that party to BIS and should do so promptly.

      (f) —(1)  Filing entities must, through their account administrators, update their identifying information such as name, address and telephone number in their SNAP-R account as necessary to keep that information accurate and current.

      (2)  Individual users must, through their account administrators, update their identifying information such as name, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address in their SNAP-R accounts as necessary to keep that information accurate and current.

      § 748.9   Support documents for evaluation of foreign parties in license applications and/or for promoting compliance with license requirements.

#### § § 748.9

      (a)  License applicants may be required to obtain support documents concerning the foreign parties and the disposition of the items intended for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country). Some support documents are issued by foreign governments, while other support documents are signed and issued by the purchaser and/or ultimate consignee. For support documents issued by foreign governments, any foreign legal restrictions or obligations exercised by the government issuing the support document are in addition to the conditions and restrictions placed on the transaction by BIS. However, the laws and regulations of the United States are in no way modified, changed, or superseded by the issuance of a support document by a foreign government.

      (b)  Unless an exception in paragraph (c) of this section applies, a support document is required for certain license applications for:

      (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) other than the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (see §§ 748.10 and 748.11(a)(2));

      (2) “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” (see § 748.11);

      (3) Firearms and related commodities to member countries of the Organization of American States (see § 748.12); and

      (4) The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China ( § 748.13).

      (c)  (1) Even if a support document requirement is imposed by paragraph (b) of this section, no support document is required for any of the following situations:

      (i) The ultimate consignee or purchaser is an “Agency of the United States Government” (see § 740.11(b)(1) for definition). If either the ultimate consignee or purchaser is not an agency of the United States government, however, a support document may still be required from the non-U.S. governmental party;

      (ii) The ultimate consignee or purchaser is a foreign government(s) or foreign government agency(ies), other than the government of the People's Republic of China. To determine whether the parties in a transaction meet the definition of “foreign government agency,” refer to the definition contained in part 772 of the EAR. If either the ultimate consignee or purchaser is not a foreign government or foreign government agency, however, a support document may still be required from the nongovernmental party;

      (iii) The license application is filed by, or on behalf of, a relief agency registered with the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, U.S. Agency for International Development, for export to a member agency in the foreign country;

      (iv) The license application is submitted for commodities for temporary exhibit, demonstration, or testing purposes;

      (v) The license application is submitted for commodities controlled for short supply reasons (see part 754 of the EAR);

      (vi) [Reserved]

      (vii) The license application is submitted for software or technology; or

      (viii) The license application is submitted for encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002, 5A004 or 5B002.

      (2) BIS will consider granting an exception to the requirement for obtaining a support document where the requirements cannot be met due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control. An exception will not be granted contrary to the objectives of the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Refer to § 748.13 of this part for specific instructions on procedures for requesting an exception.

      (d)  In addition to specific requirements described for each support document in §§ 748.10, 748.11, and 748.12, the use and submission of support documents must comply with the following requirements.

      (1)  All abbreviations, coded terms, or other expressions on support documents having special significance in the trade or to the parties to the transaction must be explained on an attachment to the document. Documents in a language other than English must be accompanied by an attachment giving an accurate English translation, either made by a translating service or certified by the applicant to be correct. Explanations or translations should be provided on a separate piece of paper, and not entered on the support documents themselves.

      (2)  (i) The license application covering the transaction discloses all facts pertaining to the transaction. Information contained in a support document obtained after submission of a license application and not submitted to BIS as part of the application cannot be construed as extending or expanding or otherwise modifying the specific information supplied in a license application or license issued by BIS. The authorizations contained in the resulting license are not extended by information contained in the support document regarding reexport from the country of destination, transfer (in-country), or any other facts relative to the transaction that are not reported on the license application.

      (ii) Misrepresentations, either through failure to disclose facts, concealing a material fact, or furnishing false information, may subject responsible parties to administrative or criminal action by BIS.

      (iii) In obtaining the required support document, the applicant is not relieved of the responsibility for full disclosure of any other information concerning the ultimate destination, end use, or end user of which the applicant knows, even if inconsistent with the representations made in the applicable support document. The applicant is responsible for promptly notifying BIS of any change in the facts contained in the support document that comes to the applicant's attention.

      (e) —(1)  When a support document is required for a license application in §§ 748.10, 748.11, and 748.12, license applicants may submit the application prior to receipt of a copy of the support document, unless BIS informs the applicant that the support document must be submitted with the application. However, if the license is granted, items authorized on the license may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) until the license holder obtains a copy of the support document. The documents issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region that are required pursuant to § 748.13 are not used to evaluate license applications. They must be obtained before shipment and need not be obtained before submitting a license application.

      (2)  When a support document is required for a license application, applicants should mark the appropriate box in Block 7, regardless of whether a copy of the support document is on file with the applicant at the time of submission.

      (f)  License applicants must retain on file the original or a copy of any support document issued in support of a license application submitted to BIS. All recordkeeping provisions in part 762 of the EAR apply to this requirement.

      (g)  BIS reserves the right in all respects to determine to what extent any license will be issued covering items for which a support document has been issued. If a support document was issued by a foreign government, BIS will not seek or undertake to give consideration to recommendations from the foreign government as to the action to be taken on a license application. A support document will be only one of the factors upon which BIS will base its licensing action, since end uses and other considerations are important factors in the decision making process.

      (h)  (1) Whenever the requirement for a PRC End-User Statement, Statement by Ultimate Consignee or Purchaser, or Firearms Convention Import Certificate is imposed or extended by a change in the regulations, the license application need not conform to the new support documentation requirements for a period of 45 days after the effective date of the regulatory change published in the .

      (2) License applications filed during the 45-day grace period may require the submission of evidence available to the applicant that will support representations concerning the ultimate consignee, ultimate destination, and end use, such as copies of the order, letters of credit, correspondence between the applicant and ultimate consignee, or other documents received from the ultimate consignee. If such evidence is required, applicants must also identify the regulatory change (including its effective date) that justifies exercise of the 45-day grace period.

      (v) Signature of the importer and date.

      (d) —(1)  A PRC End-User Statement may cover more than one purchase order and more than one item. Where the Statement includes items for which more than one license application will be submitted, the applicant should ensure that the total quantities on the license application(s) do not exceed the total quantities shown on the PRC End-User Statement.

      (2)  After a PRC End-User Statement is issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made on the certificate by any person. Any necessary corrections, additions, or alterations should be noted by the applicant in a separate statement on file with the applicant.

      (3)  A PRC End-User Statement is valid until the quantities of items identified on the Statement have been shipped.

      § 748.11   Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.

#### § § 748.11

      (a) —(1)  Unless an exception in § 748.9(c) or paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies, a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is required if the license application includes “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” (600 series MDE) requiring a license for any reason on the Commerce Control List and such items are destined for a country other than the PRC.

      (2)  The requirement to obtain a support document for license applications involving the PRC is generally determined by § 748.10(a) of the EAR. However, a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser may be substituted in place of a PRC End-User Statement when the commodities to be exported ( replacement parts and components) are valued at $75,000 or less and are for servicing previously exported commodities.

      (3)  The general requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if the applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee, provided the required statements are contained in Block 24 on the license application. This exemption does not apply, however, where the applicant and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or affiliated or associated firms.

      (b)  (1) The ultimate consignee and purchaser must complete either a statement on company letterhead, or Form BIS-711, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, any reference in this section to “Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser” applies to both the statement on company letterhead and to Form BIS-711.

      (2) If the consignee and purchaser elect to complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary.

      (3) If the ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate statements must be prepared and signed.

      (4) If the ultimate consignee and purchaser elect to complete Form BIS-711, only one Form BIS-711 (containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser) need be completed.

      (5) Whether the ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a written statement or complete Form BIS-711, the following constraints apply:

      (i) Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee or purchaser must sign the statement. “Responsible official” is defined as someone with personal knowledge of the information included in the statement, and authority to bind the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom they sign, and who has the power and authority to control the use and disposition of the licensed items.

      (ii) The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located in the United States or in a foreign country. The official title of the person signing the statement must also be included.

      (iii) The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send a new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.

      (c)  See supplement no. 3 to this part for the information necessary to complete a statement on company letterhead or on Form BIS-711.

      (d) —(1)  (i) If a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is obtained prior to submission of the license application and the Statement is required to support one or more license applications, an applicant must submit the first license application within one year from the date the statement was signed.

      (ii) All subsequent license applications supported by the same Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser must be submitted within four years of signature by the consignee or purchaser, whichever was last.

      (2) [Reserved]

      § 748.12   Firearms import certificate or import permit.

#### § § 748.12

      License applications for certain firearms and related commodities require support documents in accordance with this section.

      (a)  Unless an exception in § 748.9(c) applies, an import certificate or permit is required for license applications for firearms and related commodities, regardless of value, if required by the importing country. For OAS member states, this requirement is consistent with the OAS Model Regulations described in § 742.17 of the EAR. The exporter or reexporter must obtain and submit with the license application the original or a copy of the import certificate or permit before applying for an export or reexport license in situations in which an import certificate or permit is required by the importing country.

      (1)  Firearms and related commodities are those commodities controlled under 0x5zz ECCNs.

      (2)  (i) OAS member countries include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela, and any member country that has acceded in accordance with Chapter III of the Charter of the Organization of American States.

      (ii) All other countries that require an import certificate or permit.

      (3)  For those countries that have not yet established or implemented an import certificate procedure, BIS will accept an equivalent official document ( import license or letter of authorization) issued by the government of the importing country as supporting documentation for the export of commodities detailed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (b)  (1) Applicants must request that the importer ( ultimate consignee or purchaser) obtain the import certificate, permit, or an equivalent official document from the government of the importing country, and that it be issued covering the quantities and types of firearms and related items that the applicant intends to export. Upon receipt of this document or a certified copy, the importer must provide the original or a certified copy to the license applicant.

      (2) If the government of the importing country will not issue such document, the applicant must supply the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6) through (c)(8) of this section on company letterhead.

      (c)  The document must contain the following information:

      (1) Applicant's name and address. The applicant may be either the exporter, supplier, or order party.

      (2) Import Certificate Identifier/Number.

      (3) Name of the country issuing the certificate or unique country code.

      (4) Date the document was issued, in international date format ( 24/12/12 for 24 December 2012, or 3/1/99 for 3 January 1999).

      (5) Name of the agency issuing the certificate, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, signing officer name, and signature.

      (6) Name of the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial or government body, citizenship, and signature.

      (7) Name of the end user(s), if known and different from the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial (authorized distributor or reseller) or government body, citizenship, and signature. Note that BIS does not require the identification of each end user when the firearms and related commodities will be resold by a distributor or reseller if unknown at the time of export.

      (8) Description of the commodities approved for import including a technical description and total quantity of firearms, parts and components, ammunition and parts.

      (9) Expiration date of the document in international date format ( 24/12/12) or the date the items must be imported, whichever is earlier.

      (10) Name of the country of export ( United States).

      (11) Additional information. Certain countries may require the tariff classification number, by class, under the Brussels Convention (Harmonized Tariff Code) or the specific technical description of a commodity. For example, shotguns may need to be described in barrel length, overall length, number of shots, manufacturer's name and country of manufacture. The technical description is not the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN).

      (d) —(1)  The license application must include the same commodities as those listed on the document.

      (2)  After the document is used to support the issuance of a license, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made on the same document by any person. Any necessary corrections, additions, or alterations should be noted by the applicant in a separate statement on file with the applicant.

      (3)  Documents issued by the importing country will be valid until the expiration date on the documents themselves.

      (e)  If the country to which firearms, parts, components, accessories, and attachments controlled under ECCN 0A501, or ammunition controlled under ECCN 0A505, are being exported or reexported requires that a government-issued certificate or permit be obtained prior to importing the commodity, the exporter or reexporter must obtain and retain on file the original or a copy of that certificate or permit before applying for an export or reexport license unless:

      (1) A license is not required for the export or reexport; or

      (2) The exporter is required to obtain an import or end-user certificate or other equivalent official document pursuant to paragraphs (a) thorough (d) of this section and has, in fact, complied with that requirement.

      (3)(i) The number or other identifying information of the import certificate or permit must be stated on the license application.

      (ii) If the country to which the commodities are being exported does not require an import certificate or permit for firearms imports, that fact must be noted on any license application for ECCN 0A501 or 0A505 commodities.

      § 748.13   Hong Kong import and export licenses.

#### § § 748.13

      (a) —(1)  An exporter or reexporter must obtain the documents described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section before using a license issued by BIS to export or reexport to Hong Kong any item subject to the EAR and controlled on the CCL for NS, MT, NP column 1, or CB reasons. Collectively, the documents issued by Hong Kong must cover all of the items to be exported or reexported pursuant to a license.

      (i) A copy of an import license issued to the Hong Kong importer by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pursuant to the Hong Kong Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, that covers the items to be exported or reexported pursuant to that BIS license for which a Hong Kong import license is required and that is valid on the date of the export or reexport that is subject to the EAR; or

      (ii) A copy of a written statement issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that no import license is required to import into Hong Kong the item(s) to be exported or reexported to Hong Kong. The statement may have been issued directly to the Hong Kong importer or it may be a written statement available to the general public. The statement may be used for more than one export or reexport to Hong Kong so long as it remains an accurate statement of Hong Kong law.

      (2)  No license issued by BIS may be used to reexport from Hong Kong any item subject to the EAR controlled on the CCL for NS, MT, NP column 1, and/or CB reasons unless the reexporter has received either:

      (i) An export license issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pursuant to the Hong Kong Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, that covers all items to be rexported pursuant to that BIS license for which a Hong Kong export license is required and that is valid on the date of the reexport that is subject to the EAR; or

      (ii) A copy of a written statement issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that no export license is required from Hong Kong for the item(s) to be reexported. The statement may have been issued directly to the Hong Kong reexporter or it may be a written statement available to the general public. The statement may be used for more than one reexport from Hong Kong so long as it remains an accurate statement of Hong Kong law.

      (b)  The documents required to be obtained by paragraph (a) of this section must be retained and made available to the U.S. Government upon request in accordance with part 762 of the EAR.

      § 748.14   Granting of exceptions to the support documentation requirements.

#### § § 748.14

      (a)  A request for an exception to obtaining the required support documentation will be considered by BIS; however, an exception will not be granted contrary to the objectives of the U.S. export control program. A request for exception may involve either a single transaction or, where the reason necessitating the request is continuing in nature, multiple transactions. If satisfied by the evidence presented, BIS may waive the support document requirement and accept the license application for processing.

      (b)  The request for an exception must be submitted with the license application to which the request relates, and the reason(s) for requesting the exception must be described in Block 24 or referred to in Block 24. Where the request relates to more than one license application, it should be submitted with the first license application and referred to in Block 24 on any subsequent license application.

      (c) —(1)  Where a single transaction is involved, BIS will act on the request for exception at the same time as the license application with which the request is submitted. In those instances where the related license application is approved, the issuance of the license will serve as an automatic notice to the applicant that the exception was approved. If any restrictions are placed on granting of the exception, these will appear on the approval. If the request for exception is not approved, BIS will advise the applicant.

      (2)  Where multiple transactions are involved, BIS will advise the applicant of the action taken on the exception request. The response from BIS will contain any conditions or restrictions that BIS finds necessary to impose (including an exception termination date if appropriate). In addition, a written acceptance of these conditions or restrictions may be required from the parties to the transaction.

      § 748.15   Authorization Validated End-User (VEU).

#### § § 748.15

      Validated end-users (VEU) are those who have been previously approved by BIS pursuant to the requirements of this section. To be eligible for authorization VEU, exporters, reexporters, and validated end-user applicants must adhere to the conditions and restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. If a request for VEU Authorization for a particular end-user is not granted, no new license requirement is triggered. In addition, such a result does not render the end user ineligible for license approvals from BIS. There are two types of VEU authorization: General VEU Authorization and Data Center VEU Authorization. General VEU Authorizations permit the export, reexport, and transfer to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be used in a specific eligible destination. Data Center VEU Authorizations permit the export and reexport to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be used in specific data centers. A data center is a facility or “facilities” that house a multi-racked, networked computer system that include servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. Data Center VEU Authorizations may be either universal or national authorizations.

      (a)(1)  The only end users to whom eligible items may be exported, reexported, or transferred under a General VEU Authorization or a Data Center VEU Authorization are those validated end-users identified in Supplement No. 7 to this part. Those entities were added as VEUs according to the provisions in this Section and Supplement Nos. 8 and 9 to this part.

      (2) —(i)  To apply for a General VEU Authorization or Data Center VEU Authorization, requests for authorization must be submitted in the form of an advisory opinion request, as described in § 748.3(c), and must include a list of items (except as excluded by paragraph (c) of this section), identified by ECCN, intended for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to an eligible end-user, once approved.

      (ii) —(A)  A UVEU authorization should be submitted by the owner of the advanced computing ICs. To qualify for UVEU authorization, the owner of the advanced computing ICs must certify that it will follow the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part. The owner of the advanced compute must certify that it will follow the guidelines in paragraphs 14, 15, and 18 of supplement no. 10 to this part on or before January 15, 2026. If the owner of the advanced computing ICs cannot certify to all of the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part, it must notify BIS in its application of the other entities involved in its operations. The applicant must also provide signed certifications from such entities as set forth in supplement no. 10 to this part. For UVEUs, if the operator of the advanced compute is different from the owner of the advanced compute, the operator must itself have an Authorization UVEU. As appropriate, BIS will adjudicate complete UVEU applications within 30 days of receipt. A UVEU will need to file a notification with BIS when building a datacenter in a new location 180 days before any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to the new datacenter. The notification should include the physical address of the new data center location. BIS will use this information to update the eligible destination column in the validated end user list in supplement no. 7 to this part. The UVEU may choose whether to list a corporate address or a physical address of the new data center location. The UVEU may furnish its BIS authorization letter as proof of its authorization to receive exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) prior to the publication of an amendment to Supplement No. 7 to this part that includes a physical address, or where supplement no. 7 includes a corporate address but not a physical address. No other requirements may be placed on the UVEU beyond those described in supplement no. 10 to this part as a condition for granting the original UVEU application.

      (B)  UVEUs will be subject to the geographic allocations identified in paragraph 6 or supplement no. 10 to this part.

      (iii) —(A)  The NVEU Authorization will allow an entity to receive exports and reexports in a specific country as specified in their NVEU authorization. For every additional country in which the NVEU wants to operate, the owner of the advanced compute must obtain a separate NVEU authorization. To qualify for NVEU authorization, the owner of the advanced computing ICs must adhere to guidelines provided in supplement no. 10 to this part but, depending on its location and the national security and foreign policy risks associated with that location, may be subject to other requirements. The owner of the advanced compute must certify that it will follow the guidelines in paragraphs 14, 15, and 18 of supplement no. 10 to this part on or before January 15, 2026. If the owner of the advanced computing ICs cannot certify to all of the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part, it must notify BIS in its application of the other entities involved in its operations. Applicants must provide written assurances from those other entities consistent with supplement no. 10 to this part during the application review process. Government-to-Government assurances between the United States and the government of the country in which the NVEU wishes to operate may be sought before a NVEU is granted. Where multiple entities will own and operate the NVEU they should submit a joint application. For NVEUs, if the operator of the advanced compute is different from the owner of the advanced compute, the operator must itself have its own Authorization NVEU. After receiving NVEU Authorization, the NVEU will be listed as such in supplement no. 7 to this part. The NVEU may inform BIS if it prefers that supplement no. 7 list a corporate address or a physical address of the new data center location. Once approved for Authorization NVEU by BIS, the NVEU may furnish its BIS authorization letter that includes physical addresses as proof of its authorization to receive exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) prior to the publication of an amendment to supplement no. 7 that includes a physical address, or where supplement no. 7 includes a corporate address but not a physical address.

      (B)  NVEUs will be subject to a per-NVEU per-country installed base allocation of total processing performance (TPP), as measured by the collective computing power of items subject to ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z paragraphs, as provided below:

      These TPP allocations represent permitted cumulative installed base during a given quarter, not newly available TPP in addition to previous-quarter installed bases, and do not count towards or impact country allocations. Advanced computing ICs that suffer attrition due to factors such as loss, damage, failure, relocation, and resale do not count toward allocations.

      (iv)  To ensure a thorough review, applications for Authorization VEU must include the information described in supplement no. 8 to this part. Applications for UVEU and NVEU should also include information demonstrating that the applicant can adhere to the guidelines described in supplement no. 10 to this part. Requests for authorization will be accepted from exporters, reexporters, or end users. Submit the request to: The Office of Exporter Services, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230. Mark the package “Request for [insert “General,” “Data Center—Universal,” or “Data Center—National” as appropriate] Authorization Validated End-user.”

      (3)  In evaluating an end user for eligibility under authorization VEU, the ERC will consider a range of information, including but not limited to such factors as: the end user's record of exclusive engagement in appropriate end-use activities; the end user's compliance with U.S. export controls; the need for an on-site review prior to approval; the end user's capability of complying with the requirements of authorization VEU, the ability of the end user to guard against both the misuse and diversion of computing resources; the end user's technology roadmap; the end user's technology control plan; the end user's agreement to on-site reviews by representatives of the U.S. Government to ensure adherence to the conditions of the VEU authorization; and the end user's relationships with U.S. and foreign companies. In addition, when evaluating the eligibility of an end user, the ERC will consider the status of the eligible destination country's export controls and the support and adherence to multilateral export control regimes of the government of the eligible destination.

      (4)  The VEU authorization is subject to revision, suspension, or revocation entirely or in part.

      (5)  Information submitted in a VEU request is deemed to constitute continuing representations of existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change relating to the authorization must be promptly reported to BIS, whether VEU authorization has been granted or is still under consideration.

      (b) —(1)  General VEU Authorizations may be used for the following destinations:

      (i) The People's Republic of China.

      (ii) India.

      (2)  (i) UVEU must be headquartered in, or have their ultimate parent company headquartered in, destinations listed in paragraph (a) of Supplement No. 5 to Part 740, and UVEU data centers may be located anywhere, except in Macau or destinations specified in Country Group D:5.

      (ii) NVEU may be headquartered, have an ultimate parent headquartered, or located in a destination specified in Country Groups A, B, or D:1-D:4, except Macau or destinations specified in Country Group D:5. NVEU data centers can be built around the world, except in Macau or destinations specified in Country Group D:5.

      (c)  (1) Items controlled under the EAR for missile technology (MT) and crime control (CC) reasons may not be exported or reexported under General or Data Center VEU Authorizations.

      (2) Eligible items for Data Center VEU Authorizations are all those items on the Commerce Control List, that require a license to the destination excluding “600 series” items, and are necessary for a data center.

      (d) —(1)  Items obtained under General VEU Authorizations in China may be used only for civil end uses and may not be used for any activities described in part 744 of the EAR. The restrictions of §§ 744.6(c)(2)(i) through (iii) and 744.23(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the EAR do not apply to VEUs identified in supplement no. 7 to part 748 as excluded from §§ 744.6(c)(2)(i) through (iii) and 744.23(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the EAR. Items obtained under General VEU Authorizations in India may be used for either civil or military end uses and may not be used for any activities described in part 744 of the EAR. Exports, reexports, or transfers made under authorization VEU may be made to an end user listed in supplement No. 7 to this part only if the items will be consigned to and for use by the validated end user. Eligible end-users who obtain items under VEU may only:

      (i) Use such items at the end-user's own facility located in an eligible destination or at a facility located in an eligible destination over which the end-user demonstrates effective control;

      (ii) Consume such items during use; or

      (iii) Transfer or reexport such items only as authorized by BIS.

      (2)  Items obtained under Data Center VEU Authorizations may not be used for any activities described in part 744 of the EAR. Eligible validated end users who obtain items under VEU may only:

      (i) Use such items at the end user's own facility located in an authorized destination;

      (ii) Consume such items during use; or

      (iii) In-country transfers and reexports are not permitted under Data Center VEU Authorization unless the transfer (in-country) or reexport is to a VEU authorized location by the same VEU or a separate authorization is obtained.

      (e)  Prior to an initial export or reexport to a validated end-user under General or Data Center VEU Authorization, exporters or reexporters must obtain certifications from the validated end-user regarding end-use and compliance with VEU requirements. Such certifications must include the contents set forth in supplement no. 8 to this part. Certifications and all records relating to VEU must be retained by exporters or reexporters in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR.

      (f) —(1) —(i)  Reexporters who make use of General VEU Authorizations are required to submit annual reports to BIS. Reexporters who make use of Data Center VEU Authorizations are required to submit semi-annual reports to BIS. For either authorization, reexporters must include, for each validated end user to whom the exporter or reexporter exported or reexported eligible items:

Notification of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) to the VEU must be made within a timeframe agreed to in writing by the VEU and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in-country). The VEU and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in-country) must agree to the notification timeframe prior to the initial shipment or transfer under the VEU Authorizations. Depending on the agreement between the VEU and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in-country), a notification may be for individual shipments or for multiple shipments. Exporters, reexporters and VEUs are required to maintain the notifications they send or receive in accordance with their recordkeeping requirements.

      (h)  VEUs that are subject to item-specific conditions and have received items subject to such conditions under General or Data Center VEU Authorizations are no longer bound by the conditions associated with the items if the items no longer require a license for export or reexport to the PRC, India, or data center location, as applicable, or become eligible for shipment under a license exception to the destination. Items that become eligible for a license exception are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable license exception and the restrictions in § 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become eligible for export without a license and that remain subject to the EAR may only be exported, reexported, transferred (in-country) or disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of VEU conditions does not relieve a validated end-user of its responsibility for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a license exception or prior to the removal of license requirements.

      (i)  Records of items that were shipped under General or Data Center VEU Authorizations prior to the removal of a license requirement or the availability of a license exception remain subject to the review requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section on and after the date that the license requirement was removed or the license exception became applicable.

#### § § 748.16

      You must submit an advisory opinion, in accordance with § 748.3 of this part and the provisions in this section, to request an addition or modification to or removal from the approved integrated circuit designers list in supplement no. 6 to part 740 of the EAR, or the approved “OSAT” companies list in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR. The advisory opinion request must adhere to the provisions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Denied requests do not result in new license requirements or render the applicant ineligible for license approvals from BIS, nor does a denied request preclude a company from submitting a subsequent request.

      (a)(1)  Only entities not headquartered or having an ultimate parent headquartered in Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 will be considered for addition to either list. Only entities that have designed, assembled, tested, or packaged integrated circuits, or have credible plans to do so, will be considered for addition to either list. To ensure a thorough review, requests to be added to either list must include the information in supplement no. 4 to this part.

      (2)  Any listed party may request to be removed from a list or have their listing modified. If a listed entity's legal status changes ( is dissolved), then they must request to be removed from the appropriate list. If control of the listed entity changes or the name changes, then the company must submit a modification request. If the company can no longer abide by the provisions of the EAR that pertain to approved entities, then they must request removal from the relevant list.

      (3)  All requests should be emailed to  with a subject line stating, “Approved supply chain entities request.”

      (4)  The End-user Review Committee (ERC) will review all requests (additions, modifications, and removals) to both lists.

      (i) The ERC will consider a range of information for requests to be added to a list, potentially including but not limited to such factors as:

      (A) the applicant's record of exclusive engagement in appropriate end-use activities;

      (B) the applicant's compliance with U.S. export controls;

      (C) the need for an on-site review prior to approval;

      (D) the applicant's capability of complying with the requirements of being added to the approved integrated circuit designers list or approved “OSAT” companies list;

      (E) the ability of the applicant to guard against both the misuse and diversion of computing resources; and

      (F) the applicant's relationships with U.S. and foreign companies. In addition, when evaluating the application, the ERC will consider the status of the export controls of the country or countries where the applicant is headquartered, and these countries' support of and adherence to multilateral export control regimes.

      (ii) Requests to modify a listing due to a change in ownership or other substantive change to the listed entity will be considered in light of all of the criteria listed above. Requests to modify a listing to correct clerical errors or non-substantive changes to the listed entity's information will typically be approved.

      (iii) In reviewing requests to be removed from a list, BIS will consider facts regarding the entity's compliance with the requirements of its status and the entity's rationale for removing its status. In general, requests to be removed from a list will be approved.

      (5)  Approved integrated circuit designer and approved “OSAT” company status ( listing) is subject to revision, suspension, or revocation entirely or in part.

      (6)  Information submitted in an addition or modification request is deemed to constitute continuing representations of existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change relating to the request must be promptly reported to the ERC, whether approved or still under consideration.

      (b)  Records relating to all requests must be retained by the requester in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR.

      (c)  Authorized integrated circuit designers, to be eligible for that status consistent with Note 1 to ECCN 3A090.a, are required to submit certain information to the “front-end fabricator,” which the “front-end fabricator” must then report to BIS. See § 743.9 of the EAR.

      (d)  Approved integrated circuit designers and approved “OSAT” companies may request to be removed from a relevant list, however, the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (b) of this section and the reporting requirements in paragraph (c) of this section must be adhered to until the listing is removed from the relevant list.

      § 750.3   Review of license applications by BIS and other government agencies and departments.

#### § § 750.3

      (a)  In reviewing specific license applications, BIS will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition to reviewing the item and end-use, BIS will consider the reliability of each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence information. To the maximum extent possible, BIS will make licensing decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies, however, BIS may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies regarding any license application.

      (b)  (1) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted under the EAR. In addition, BIS may, where appropriate, refer license applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These agencies and departments will be referred to as “agencies” for the purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to review any license application, they may determine that they do not need to review certain types of license applications. In these instances, the agency will provide BIS with a Delegation of Authority to process those license applications without review by that particular agency.

      (2) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and ACDA are generally concerned with license applications involving items controlled for national security, missile technology, nuclear nonproliferation, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons or destined for countries and/or end uses of concern. In particular, these agencies are concerned with reviewing license applications as follows:

      (i) The Department of Defense is concerned primarily with items controlled for national security and regional stability reasons and with controls related to encryption items;

      (ii) The Department of Energy is concerned primarily with items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons;

      (iii) The Department of State is concerned primarily with items controlled for national security, nuclear nonproliferation, missile technology, regional stability, anti-terrorism, crime control reasons, and sanctions; and

      (iv) The Department of Justice is concerned with controls relating to encryption items and items primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.

      § 750.4   Procedures for processing license applications.

#### § § 750.4

      (a)  (1) All license applications will be resolved or referred to the President no later than 90 calendar days from the date of BIS's registration of the license application. Processing times for the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures and time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to license applications registered prior to February 4, 1996.

      (2) Properly completed license applications will be registered promptly upon receipt by BIS. Registration is defined as the point at which the application is entered into BIS's electronic license processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that prevent BIS from registering your application, BIS will attempt to contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BIS is unable to contact you, the license application will be returned without being registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application. If a license application is registered, but BIS is unable to correct deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and the action necessary to correct the deficiencies. If you decide to resubmit the license application, it will be treated as a new license application when calculating license processing time frames.

      (b)  The following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of license applications:

      (1)  BIS may request applicants to provide additional information in support of their license application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BIS has provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in § 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement to such modifications from the foreign parties to the license application.

      (2)  BIS conducts pre-license checks in order to establish the identity and reliability of the recipient of the items subject to the EAR that require a license, as well as to substantiate representations made on the license application. The results of the pre-license check, including the U.S. government's inability to conduct the pre-license check due to the end user's or host government's actions, will be considered in determining the outcome of a license application. The time required to conduct a pre-license check is not included in license application processing time calculations according to this paragraph, if the pre-license check is:

      (i) Conducted through government channels, and

      (ii) The request for a pre-license check is made by the Secretary or by another agency within the following time frames:

      (A) The pre-license check is requested within 5 days of the determination that it is necessary; and

      (B) The analysis resulting from the pre-license check is completed and reported to licensing officials within 5 days.

      (3)  Requests for government-to-government assurances of suitable end-use of items approved for export or reexport when failure to obtain such assurances would result in rejection of the license application, provided that:

      (i) The request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of State within five days of the determination that the assurances are required;

      (ii) The Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant government within 10 days of receipt of the request for such assurances; and

      (iii) The license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's receipt of the requested assurances.

      (4)  Consultation with other governments, if such consultation is provided for by a relevant bilateral arrangement or multilateral regime as a precondition for approving a license.

      (5)  Multilateral review of a license application if such review is required by the relevant multilateral regime.

      (6)  Under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA), the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days prior to issuing a license to any country designated by the Secretary of State as being terrorist-supporting for any items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such countries, or could enhance the ability of such countries to support acts of international terrorism. Accordingly, the issuance of any license subject to this requirement will be delayed for 30 days.

      (i)  The following countries have been designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries: Iran, North Korea, and Syria.

      (ii)  License applications involving the export or reexport of the following items to the military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users are subject to this notification requirement:

      (A) All items controlled for national security reasons;

      (B) All items controlled for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons;

      (C) All items controlled for missile technology reasons;

      (D) All items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; and

      (E) All items controlled by the CCL where the entry heading identifies the items controlled as those contained in the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List.

      (iii)  The Secretaries of Commerce and State must also notify the appropriate Congressional committees 30 days before a license is issued for the export or reexport of any item controlled on the CCL to a designated country if the Secretary of State determines that the export or reexport “could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international terrorism.”

      (7)  Congressional notification, including any consultations prior to notification, prior to the issuance of an authorization to export when notification is required by § 743.5 of the EAR.

      (8)  Applicant must obtain approval by the Department of Defense of a technology transfer control plan and the National Security Agency of an encryption technology transfer control plan and must make arrangements with the Department of Defense for monitoring of all launch activities.

      (c)  Within 9 days of license application registration, BIS will, as appropriate:

      (1) Contact the applicant if additional information is required, if the license application is improperly completed, or required support documents are missing, to request additional or corrected information;

      (2) Assure the stated classification on the license application is correct;

      (3) Return the license application if a license is not required with a statement notifying the applicant that a license is not required;

      (4) Approve the license application or notify the applicant of the intent to deny the license application; or

      (5) Refer the license application electronically along with all necessary recommendations and analysis concurrently to all agencies unless the application is subject to a Delegation of Authority. Any relevant information not contained in the electronic file will be simultaneously forwarded in paper copy.

      (d)  (1) Within 10 days of receipt of a referral the reviewing agency must advise BIS of any information not contained in the referral as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. BIS will promptly request such information from the applicant. The time that elapses between the date the information is requested by the reviewing agency and the date the information is received by the reviewing agency will not be counted in processing time frames.

      (2) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial referral, the reviewing agency will provide BIS with a recommendation either to approve (with or without conditions or riders) or deny the license application. As appropriate, such a recommendation may be made with the benefit of consultation and/or discussions in interagency groups established to provide expertise and coordinate interagency consultation. These interagency groups consist of:

      (i)  The MTEC, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items controlled for missile technology reasons. The MTEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of MT concern.

      (ii)  The SNEC, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons. The SNEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of NP concern.

      (iii)  The Shield, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items controlled for chemical and biological weapons reasons. The Shield also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CBW) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of CBW concern.

      (iv)  The RSIWG, chaired by the State Department, reviews license applications involving remote sensing spacecraft described in ECCN 9A515.a.1, .a.2, .a.3, or .a.4, sensitive remote sensing components described in 9A515.g, or “technology” described in ECCN 9E515.f.

      (v)  The Safeguard, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving firearm and shotgun related items controlled under 0x5zz ECCNs.

      (e)  Reviewing agencies recommending denial of a license application must provide a statement of reasons, consistent with the provisions of the EAA or EAR, and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the recommendation to deny. A reviewing agency that fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days with a statement of reasons supported by the statutory and regulatory basis shall be deemed to have no objection to the final decision of BIS.

      (f) —(1)  (i) In any instance where the reviewing agencies are not in agreement on final disposition of a license application, it will be escalated to the OC for resolution. The Chair of the OC will consider the recommendations of the reviewing agencies and any information provided by the applicant in person during an open OC session. Each agency will be informed of the Chair's decision on the license application within 14 days after the deadline for receiving agency recommendations.

      (ii) If any agency disagrees with the OC Chair's decision, the agency may escalate the decision by appealing to the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy for resolution. If such a request for escalation is not made within 5 days of the decision of the OC Chair, the Chair's decision will be final.

      (2)  Requests for escalation to the ACEP must be in writing from an official appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or a person properly acting in such capacity, and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. The ACEP will review all relevant information and recommendations. The Chair of the ACEP will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP within 11 days from the date of receipt of the escalation request. Within 5 days of the decision, any dissenting agency may appeal in writing the ACEP's decision to the Secretary of Commerce in the Secretary's capacity as the Chair of the Export Administration Review Board. The written request must be made by the head of the agency requesting escalation and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. Within the same period of time, the Secretary may initiate a meeting on his or her own initiative to consider a license application. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the ACEP will be final.

      (3)  The EARB will review all relevant information and recommendations, and such other export control matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary of Commerce will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the EARB within 11 days from the date of receipt of the appeal. Within 5 days of the decision, any agency dissenting from the decision of the EARB may appeal the decision to the President. The appeal must be in writing from the head of the dissenting agency. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the EARB will be final.

      (D) The export, reexport, or in-country transfer of these additional HTS-6 Codes under supplements nos. 2, 4, or 5 to part 746 or items identified under supplement no. 6 to part 746 will not exceed the shipping tolerance of the original license or the number of units authorized under the original license.

      (2) In some circumstances, BIS may authorize changing the name of a person listed on a license (, name of exporter, reexporter, purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee or end user), provided the pertinent person has not undergone a change in ownership, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued. In order to rely on this paragraph (c)(2), BIS must have approved the name change in response to an advisory opinion request submitted by the licensee pursuant to § 748.3(c) of the EAR and the instructions below.

      (i) The advisory opinion request must be submitted on the licensee's company letterhead and include the following information:

      (A) The title of the advisory opinion, in this format: “License name change notification and review request;”

      (B) All license numbers subject to the notification and review request (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);

      (C) The name(s) changing on the license(s) (include the original and new names), and when the name(s) are changing (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);

      (D) Any background information available on the reasons for the name change(s) (e.g., press releases from the person changing its name(s)); and

      (E) A statement regarding whether there has been a change in ownership, including a merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status regarding the person(s) changing its name(s).

      (F) Confirmation that, if the request is approved, the licensee will share the advisory opinion response from BIS with all other persons listed on the license, and inform those persons that the advisory opinion response must be retained pursuant to the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.

      (ii) If BIS determines the name change is not a material change to the license and approves the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification. If BIS does not approve the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification.

      (iii) For guidance on using an export license with approved name changes, see § 758.4(d) (Exports against license with approved name change).

      (iv) If a license name change notification and review request is denied by BIS or the licensee determines that there has been a material change to the license, such as a change in ownership of a person on the license, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued, a new license application should be submitted.

      (d)  The person to whom a license is issued is the licensee. In export transactions, the exporter must be the licensee, and the exporter-licensee is responsible for the proper use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. In reexport or routed export transactions, a U.S. agent acting on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest may be the licensee; in these cases, both the agent and the foreign principal party in interest, on whose behalf the agent has acted, are responsible for the use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. It is the licensee's responsibility to communicate in writing the specific license conditions to the parties to whom those conditions apply. In addition, when required by the license, the licensee is responsible for obtaining written acknowledgment(s) of receipt of the conditions from the party(ies) to whom those conditions apply.

      (e)  No person convicted of a violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See § 766.25 of the EAR.

      (f)  Unlike software and technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity and dollar value limit. Any license resulting from a license application to export or reexport commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified unit of quantity commonly used in trade. A total dollar value for the commodity will be authorized based on the per unit price of the commodity. Subject to the shipping tolerances authorized in § 750.11 of this part, the authorization is limited by both the quantity and value listed on the license.

      (g)  Licenses involving the export or reexport of items will generally have a four-year validity period, unless a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved by BIS or is otherwise specified on the license at the time that it is issued. Exceptions from the four-year validity period include: license applications for items controlled for short supply reasons, which will be limited to a one-year validity period during which the items must be exported, re-exported, or transferred (in country) and license applications reviewed and approved as an “emergency” (see § 748.4(h) of the EAR); and items controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A504, 0A505, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, 0A509, or listed in § 742.6(a)(6)(iii)(A) of the EAR, which will generally be limited to a one-year validity period during which the items must be exported, re-exported, or transferred (in country). Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is issued. The expiration date will be clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is automatically extended to midnight of the first business day following the expiration date.

      (1)  BIS will consider granting a validity period exceeding four years (or exceeding one year for applications subject to that shorter validity period) on a case-by-case basis when extenuating circumstances warrant such an extension. Requests for such extensions may be made at the time of application or after the license has been issued and it is still valid. BIS will not approve changes regarding other aspects of the license, such as the parties to the transaction and the countries of ultimate destination. An extended validity period will generally be granted where, for example, the transaction is related to a multi-year project; when the period corresponds to the duration of a manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, warehouse and distribution agreement, or license issued under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations; when production lead time will not permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the license; when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 4-year validity of the license; or for other similar circumstances.

      (2)  (i) The applicant must submit a letter in writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled: “Request for Validity Period Extension” and contain the following information:

      (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor;

      (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number, validation date, and current expiration date legible; and

      (C) Justification for the extension;

      (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BIS will provide the applicant with a written response.

      (h) —(1)  If you have been granted a license for the temporary export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to the United States, you must submit a license application requesting authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the United States after such use), you must ensure that your license application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly to the new destination.

      (2)  If you have been issued a license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP) through the United States, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a Transportation and Exportation customs entry or an Immediate Exportation customs entry is outstanding.

      (3)  If you have been issued a license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the General Prohibition Eight contained in § 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time of the original license application, you must notify BIS in writing once you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. Your notification must contain the original license number, and the complete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. The written request must be submitted to BIS at the address listed in § 748.1(d)(2) of the EAR.

      (4)  If you have been issued a “replacement license” (for changes to your original license not covered in paragraph (c) of this section), you must retain both the original and the replacement license.

      (i)  Exporters or reexporters who have shipped under licenses with conditions that would not apply to an export under a License Exception or if no license was required, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by these conditions when the licensed items become eligible for a License Exception or can be exported or reexported without a license. Items that become eligible for a License Exception are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable License Exception and to the restrictions in § 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become eligible for export without a license remain subject to the EAR and any export, reexport, or disposition of such items may only be made in accordance with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of license conditions does not relieve an exporter or reexporter of its responsibility for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a License Exception or prior to the removal of license requirements.

      (j)  If you have been issued a license you must retain the license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.

      § 750.8   Revocation or suspension of licenses.

#### § § 750.8

      (a)  All licenses for exports or reexports are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, without notice. BIS's Office of Exporter Services may revoke any license in which a person who has been convicted of one of the statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the license at the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BIS to stop a shipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in the process (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport). If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BIS to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of call in accordance with the provisions of the EAA.

      (b)  If BIS revokes or suspends a license, the licensee must retain all applicable supporting documents and records of shipments in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.

> [61 FR 12829, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 49331, Aug. 21, 2008; 76 FR 12280, Mar. 7, 2011; 86 FR 54813, Oct. 5, 2021]

      § 750.9   Duplicate licenses.

#### § § 750.9

      (a)  For licensees whom BIS authorized the submission of paper applications, if a license is lost, stolen or destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license by submitting a letter to the BIS at the address listed in § 748.1(d)(2) of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request.” You must certify in your letter:

      (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed; and

      (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed.

      (b)  BIS will automatically issue a duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as the intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the country from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license will be labeled “Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department”. This duplicate must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for submission to the _Hong Kong Trade Department._ The original license must be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.

      § 750.10   Transfers of licenses for exports.

#### § § 750.10

      (a)  As the licensee, you may not transfer a license issued for the export of items from the United States to any other party, except with the prior written approval of BIS. BIS may authorize a transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party in interest, and will assume all powers and responsibilities under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of the United States. BIS will approve only one transfer of the same license and only transfers of licenses to export items.

      (b) —(1)  You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing to request a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must contain the following information:

      (i) The reasons for the requested transfer;

      (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or a statement that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee are to be transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses;

      (iii) A list of all license applications for export to be transferred that are pending with BIS, identifying the Application Control Number for each, or other information that will assist in identifying the pending license applications;

      (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer the licenses and license applications to;

      (v) The facts necessitating transfer;

      (vi) A statement as to whether or not any consideration has been, or will be, paid for the transfer; and

      (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate, agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name is legally established, the new corporation or firm created, or the assets transferred and showing the effective date of such document and the state where filed or recorded.

      (2)  The person to whom you wish to transfer your license(s) must provide you a signed letter, that must be submitted with your request, containing the following:

      (i) That the transferee is a principal party in interest in the transaction covered by the license, or is acting as agent for a principal party in interest;

      (ii) That the transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States;

      (iii) That the transferee assumes all powers and responsibilities under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of the United States;

      (iv) Whether any consideration has been, has not been, or will be paid for the transfer;

      (v) The name and address of the foreign principal in instances where the transferee will make the export as an agent on behalf of a foreign principal; and

      (vi) If the license is to be transferred to a subsidiary or firm, or if you transfer to the transferee all, or a substantial portion, of your assets or business, the transferee must certify that the legal authority changing the exporter imposes on the transferee the responsibility to accept and fulfill the obligations of the transferor under the transactions covered by the license; and

      (vii) The following certification:

      (c)  Unless instructed otherwise by BIS, you must retain the license(s) pending notification by BIS of the action taken. If the request is approved, you must forward the license(s) to the transferee and the validated letter received from BIS authorizing the transfer. If the transfer request is not approved, the license(s) must either be returned to BIS or used by you if you so choose and have retained the legal and operational capacity fully to meet the responsibilities imposed by the license(s). If your initial request is returned by BIS for additional information, after obtaining the necessary information you may resubmit your request.

      § 750.11   Shipping tolerances.

#### § § 750.11

      Under some circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items from the United States to export more than the value shown on that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance. This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of a shipping tolerance and the amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted to use.

      (a) If you have already shipped the full quantity of items approved on your license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further shipment may be made under the license.

      (b) If you have not shipped the full quantity of items approved on the license, the value of all of your shipments under one license, up to the full quantity approved on the license, may exceed the total dollar value stated on that license by up to 10%, unless;

      (1) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or

      (2) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a different tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR).

      (iii) Unprocessed western red cedar described by ECCN 1C988 (Western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane). For specific licensing requirements for these items, see § 754.4 of this part.

      (iv) Horses exported by sea for slaughter covered by ECCN 0A980 (Horses for export by sea). For specific licensing requirements, see § 754.5 of this part.

      (2) It incorporates statutory provisions for the registration of U.S. agricultural commodities for exemption from short supply limitations on export (see § 754.6 of this part); and

      (3) It incorporates statutory provisions for the filing and review of petitions seeking the imposition of monitoring or controls on recyclable metallic materials and procedures for related public hearings (see § 754.7 of this part).

      (c)  Reexports of items controlled by this part require a license only if such a requirement is specifically set forth in this part or is set forth on the license authorizing the export from the United States.

      (d)  For exports involving embargoed destinations, you must satisfy the requirements of this part and also of part 746 of the EAR (Embargoes and Other Special Controls).

      § 754.4   Unprocessed western red cedar.

#### § § 754.4

      (a)  As indicated by the letters “SS” in the “Reason for Control” paragraph in the “License Requirements” section of ECCN 1C988 on the CCL (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), a license is required to all destinations, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, for the export of unprocessed western red cedar covered by ECCN 1C988 (Western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane). For a non-exhaustive list of 10-digit Harmonized System-based Schedule B commodity numbers that may apply to unprocessed western red cedar products subject to the license requirements of this section, see supplement no. 2 to part 754 of the EAR. See paragraph (c) of this section for license exceptions for timber harvested from public lands in the State of Alaska, private lands, or Indian lands, and see paragraph (d) of this section for relevant definitions.

      (b)  (1) BIS will generally deny applications for licenses to export unprocessed western red cedar harvested from Federal or State lands under harvest contracts entered into after September 30, 1979.

      (2) BIS will consider, on a case-by-case basis, applications for licenses to export unprocessed western red cedar harvested from Federal or State lands under harvest contracts entered into prior to October 1, 1979.

      (3) BIS will approve license applications for unprocessed western red cedar timber harvested from public lands in Alaska, private lands, and Indian lands. Applications must be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section for the availability of a License Exception.

      (c)  (1) Subject to the requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section, License Exception WRC may be used to export without a license unprocessed western red cedar timber harvested from Federal, State and other public lands in Alaska, all private lands, and, lands held in trust for recognized Indian tribes by Federal or State agencies.

      (2) Exporters who use License Exception WRC must obtain and retain on file the following documents:

      (i) A statement by the exporter (or other appropriate documentation) indicating that the unprocessed western red cedar timber exported under this License Exception was not harvested from State or Federal lands outside the State of Alaska, and did not become available for export through substitution of commodities so harvested or produced. If the exporter did not harvest or produce the timber, the records or statement must identify the harvester or producer and must be accompanied by an identical statement from the harvester or producer. If any intermediate party or parties held title to the timber between harvesting and purchase, the exporter must also obtain such a statement, or equivalent documentation, from the intermediate party or parties and retain it on file.

      (ii) A certificate of inspection issued by a third party log scaling and grading organization, approved by the United States Forest Service, that:

      (A) Specifies the quantity in cubic meters or board feet, scribner rule, of unprocessed western red cedar timber to be exported; and

      (B) Lists each type of brand, tag, and/or paint marking that appears on any log or unprocessed lumber in the export shipment or, alternatively, on the logs from which the unprocessed timber was produced.

      (3) The requirements and restrictions described in §§ 740.1 and 740.2 of the EAR that apply to all License Exceptions also apply to the use of License Exception WRC.

      (4) A person exporting any item pursuant to this license exception must enter on any required Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES) the correct license code that corresponds to “SS-WRC.”

      (d)  (1) Applicants requesting to export unprocessed western red cedar must apply for a license in accordance with § 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR, submit any other documents as may be required by BIS, and submit a statement from an authorized representative of the exporter, reading as follows:

      (2) In Blocks 16 and 18 of the application, “Various” may be entered when there is more than one purchaser or ultimate consignee.

      (3) For each application submitted, and for each export shipment made under a license, the exporter must assemble and retain for the period described in part 762 of the EAR, and produce or make available for inspection, the following:

      (i) A signed statement(s) by the harvester or producer, and each subsequent party having held title to the commodities, that the commodities in question were harvested under a contract to harvest unprocessed western red cedar from State or Federal lands, entered into before October 1, 1979; and

      (ii) The Automated Export System record.

      (4) A shipping tolerance of 5 percent in cubic feet or board feet scribner is allowed on the un-shipped balance of a commodity listed on a license. This tolerance applies only to the final quantity remaining un-shipped on a license against which more than one shipment is made and not to the original quantity authorized by such license. See § 750.11 of the EAR for an explanation of shipping tolerances.

      (e)  When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:

      (1)  means western red cedar (thuja plicata) timber, logs, cants, flitches, and processed lumber containing wane on one or more sides, as defined in ECCN 1C988, that has not been processed into:

      (i) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of Number 3 common or better grades, with a maximum cross section of 2,000 square centimeters (310 square inches) for any individual piece of processed western red cedar (WRC) being exported, regardless of grade;

      (ii) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;

      (iii) Veneer and plywood;

      (iv) Poles, posts, or pilings cut or treated with preservative for use as such and not intended to be further processed; and

      (v) Shakes and shingles.

      (2)  means _Federal and State lands_, excluding lands in the State of Alaska and lands held in trust by any Federal or State official or agency for a recognized Indian tribe or for any member of such tribe.

      (3)  means any person who, on October 1, 1979, had an outstanding contractual commitment to harvest western red cedar timber from State and Federal lands and who can show by previous business practice or other means that the contractual commitment was made with the intent of exporting or selling for export in unprocessed form all or part of the commodities to be harvested.

      (4)  means any person engaged in a process that transforms an unprocessed western red cedar commodity (e.g., western red cedar timber) into another unprocessed western red cedar commodity (e.g., cants) primarily through a saw mill.

      (iv)  A transcript of an informal hearing shall not be made, unless the Under Secretary determines that the national interest or other good cause warrants it, or the appellant requests a transcript. If the appellant requests a transcript, the appellant will be responsible for paying all expenses related to production of the transcript.

      (v)  Any person designated by the Under Secretary to conduct an informal hearing shall submit a written report containing a summary of the hearing and recommend action to the Under Secretary.

      (d) —(1)  In addition to the documents specifically submitted in connection with the appeal, the Under Secretary shall consider any recommendations, reports, or relevant documents available to BIS in determining the appeal, but shall not be bound by any such recommendation, nor prevented from considering any other information, or consulting with any other person or groups, in making a determination. The Under Secretary may adopt any other procedures deemed necessary and reasonable for considering an appeal. The Under Secretary shall decide an appeal within a reasonable time after receipt of the appeal. The decision shall be issued to the appellant in writing and contain a statement of the reasons for the action.

      (2)  The decision of the Under Secretary shall be final.

      (e)  Acceptance and consideration of an appeal shall not affect any administrative action, pending or in effect, unless the Under Secretary, upon request by the appellant and with opportunity for response, grants a stay.

      § 758.1   The Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES).

#### § § 758.1

      (a) The  The EEI is used by the Bureau of Census to collect trade statistics and by the Bureau of Industry and Security for export control purposes. The EEI collects basic information such as the names and addresses of the parties to a transaction; the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), the Schedule B number or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) number, the description, quantity and value of the items exported; and the license authority for the export. The EEI is a statement to the United States Government that the transaction occurred as described.

      (b)  Except when the export of items subject to the EAR is to take place electronically or in an otherwise intangible form, you must file EEI in the AES with the United States Government for items subject to the EAR, including exports by U.S. mail, in the following situations:

      (1) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that are destined to a country in Country Group E:1 or E:2 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR regardless of value;

      (2) For all exports subject to the EAR that require submission of a license application, regardless of value or destination;

      (3) For all exports of 9x515 or “600 series” items enumerated or otherwise described in paragraphs .a through .x of a 9x515 or “600 series” ECCN regardless of value or destination, including exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom;

      (4) For all exports under license exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA);

      (5) For all exports of commodities and mass market software subject to the EAR when the value of the commodities or mass market software classified under a single Schedule B Number (or HTS) is over $2,500, except as exempted by the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) in 15 CFR Part 30 and referenced in paragraph (c) of this section;

      (6) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that will be transshipped through Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom to a third destination, where the export would require EEI or license if shipped directly to the final destination from the United States (see 15 CFR 30.36(b)(2) of the FTR);

      (7) For all items exported under authorization Validated End-User (VEU);

      (8) For all exports of tangible items subject to the EAR where parties to the transaction, as described in § 748.5(d) through (f) of the EAR, are listed on the Unverified List (supplement no. 6 to part 744 of the EAR), regardless of value or destination; or

      (9) For all exports, except for exports authorized under License Exception BAG, as set forth in § 740.14 of the EAR, of commodities controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507, shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508, or ammunition controlled under ECCN 0A505 except for .c, regardless of value or destination, including exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

      (10) For all exports of items on the Commerce Control List to the People's Republic of China, Russia, or Venezuela, regardless of value, unless the export may be made under the exemption listed under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (11) For all exports of items in ECCN 3A069 when destined to a destination in Country Group D.

      (c)  A complete list of exemptions from the EEI filing requirement is set forth in the 15 CFR 30.35 through 30.40 of the FTR. Some of these FTR exemptions have elements in common with certain EAR license exceptions. An FTR exemption may be narrower than an EAR license exception. The following references are provided in order to direct you to the FTR exemptions that relate to EAR license exceptions:

      (1) License Exception Baggage (BAG), as set forth in § 740.14 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(x) of the FTR;

      (2) License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT), as set forth in § 740.12 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(h) of the FTR;

      (3) License Exception Aircraft and Vessels (AVS), as set forth in § 740.15 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(o) (5) of the FTR;

      (4) License Exception Governments and International Organizations (GOV), as set forth in § 740.11 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.39 and 30.40 of the FTR;

      (5) License Exception Technology and Software Under Restriction (TSR), as set forth in § 740.6 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(f) of the FTR; or

      (6) License Exception Temporary Imports, Exports, and Reexports (TMP) “tools of trade”, as set forth in § 740.9(a)(1) of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(b) of the FTR.

      (d)  When an exemption from filing the EEI applies, the export authority (license exception or NLR) of all the items must be entered on the loading document (e.g., Cargo Declaration, manifest, bill of lading, (master) air waybill) by the person responsible for preparing the document, see 15 CFR 30.35 of the FTR. This requirement is intended to parallel the Bureau of Census requirement, so that notations as to the basis for the EEI exemption and the license authority are entered in the same place and manner (see 15 CFR 30.45(e) and (f) of the FTR for detailed requirements). The loading document must be available for inspection by government officials, along with the items, prior to lading on the carrier.

      (e) )  The person who files the EEI to the AES must be in the United States at the time of filing. The person who transmits the EEI to the AES must be a certified AES participant in accordance with 15 CFR 30.5 of the FTR. The person who transmits EEI to the AES, whether exporter (U.S. principal party in interest) or agent, is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the EEI, except insofar as that person can demonstrate that he or she reasonably relied on information furnished by others.

      (f)  The EEI is a statement to the United States Government. The EEI is an export control document as defined in Part 772 of the EAR. False statements made thereon may be a violation of § 764.2(g) of the EAR. When EEI is filed to the AES, the filer of the EEI represents the following:

      (1) Export of the items described on the EEI filing is authorized under the terms and conditions of a license issued by BIS; is in accordance with the terms and conditions of a license exception; is authorized under “NLR” as no license is required for the shipment; or is not subject to the EAR;

      (2) Statements on the EEI filing are in conformity with the contents of any license issued by BIS, with the possible exception of the USPPI and USPPI identification blocks in routed transactions or any name change approved by BIS in writing in accordance with § 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR; and

      (3) All information shown on the EEI filing is true, accurate, and complete.

      (g)  For each item on the EEI filing, you must report the license authority (license number, License Exception symbol, or No License Required (NLR) designator), the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), and the item description in the designated blocks. The item description must be stated in Commerce Control List (CCL) terms. If those terms are inadequate to meet the Bureau of Census requirements, the FTR requires that you give enough additional detail to permit verification of the Schedule B Number (or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) number). See 15 CFR part 30, appendix B, part III of the FTR for license codes.

      (1)  When exporting under the authority of a license, you must report on the EEI filing to the AES the license code that corresponds to the license, license number, the ECCN, and an item description identical to the item description on the license.

      (2)  You must report on any required EEI filing to the AES the ECCN and the correct License Exception symbol (e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) for the License Exception(s) and the license code/license exception code that corresponds to the license exception under which you are exporting. Items temporarily in the United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under § 740.9(b)(3), are exempted from entering the ECCN. See also § 740.1(d) of the EAR.

      (3)  You must report on any required EEI filing to the AES the correct license code/license exception code when using the “NLR” designation for the items that are subject to the EAR but not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) ( items are designated as EAR99) (FTR license code “C33”), and when the items to be exported are listed on the CCL but are not subject to a license requirement. In addition, you must enter the correct ECCN on any required EEI filing for all items being exported under the NLR provisions that have a reason for control other than or in addition to anti-terrorism (AT), unless the items are destined to China, Russia, or Venezuela. For items destined to China, Russia, or Venezuela, you must enter the correct ECCN on any required EEI filing regardless of reason for control.

      (4)  This paragraph (g)(4) includes two separate requirements under paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section that are used to better identify exports of certain firearms under the EAR. Paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is limited to certain EAR authorizations. Paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section applies to all EAR authorizations that require EEI filing in AES.

      (i)  For any export authorized under License Exception TMP or a BIS license authorizing a temporary export of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507 or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508, in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, you must report the manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial number of the exported items. The requirements of this paragraph (g)(4)(i) also apply to any other export authorized under a BIS license that includes a condition or proviso on the license requiring the submission of this information specified in paragraph (g) of this section when the EEI is filed in AES.

      (ii)  For any export of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, 0A507, shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508.a.1, or .a.2, or “parts,” “components,” devices, “accessories,” or “attachments” controlled under 0A509.a, .b, .c, or .d, in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, the exporter must include the items paragraph classification or other control descriptor as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) for ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, or 0A509, as applicable, as the first text to appear in the Commodity description block in the EEI filing in AES. ( § 743.4 of the EAR for the use of this information for ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506.a or .b, and 0A507.a, or .b for conventional arms reporting).

      (A) If exporting firearms controlled under 0A501, enter .a or .b, as applicable;

      (B) If exporting shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under 0A502, enter .SB;

      (C) If exporting semi-automatic rifles controlled under 0A506, enter .a or .b, as applicable;

      (D) If exporting semi-automatic pistols controlled under 0A507, enter .a or .b, as applicable;

      (E) If exp_or_ting semi-automatic shotguns controlled under 0A508, enter .a or .b, as applicable;

      (F) If exporting “parts,” “components,” devices, “accessories,” or “attachments” controlled under ECCN 0A509, enter .a, .b, .c, .d, or .e, as applicable.

      (5)  This paragraph (g)(5) imposes a requirement for identifying .z items by “items” level classification in the EEI filing in AES. For any export of .z items controlled under ECCNs 3A001, 4A003, 4A004, 4A005, 5A002, 5A004, 5A992, 5D002, or 5D992 in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, you must include the items paragraph classification ( .z), when applicable, as the first text to appear in the Commodity description block in the EEI filing in AES.

      (h)  In a “power of attorney” or other written authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal.

      (1) An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization in the following circumstances:

      (i) An agent that represents a foreign principal party in interest in a routed transaction must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth his authority; and

      (ii) An agent that applies for a license on behalf of a principal party in interest must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth the agent's authority to apply for the license on behalf of the principal.

      (2) This requirement for a power of attorney or other written authorization is a legal requirement aimed at ensuring that the parties to a transaction negotiate and understand their responsibilities. The absence of a power of attorney or other written authorization does not prevent BIS from using other evidence to establish the existence of an agency relationship for purposes of imposing liability.

      (i)  The EEI must be filed with the United States Government in the manner prescribed by the Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR part 30).

      § 758.2   Automated Export System (AES).

#### § § 758.2

      The Bureau of the Census' Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) (15 CFR Part 30) contain provisions for filing Electronic Export Information (EEI) using the Automated Export System (AES). In order to use AES, you must apply directly to the Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) for certification and approval (see 15 CFR 30.5(a) of the FTR). Two electronic filing options (predeparture and postdeparture) are available for transmitting EEI. Predeparture filing requires that all information be reported in AES prior to export (15 CFR 30.4(a) and (b) of the FTR). Postdeparture filing is available only for approved companies (approved by the Census Bureau, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and BIS) and requires no information to be transmitted prior to export with complete information reported postdeparture no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of exportation (15 CFR 30.4(c) of the FTR).

      (a)  Exporters, or agents applying on behalf of an exporter, may apply for postdeparture privileges by submitting a Letter of Intent to the Bureau of Census (Census Bureau) Census Bureau in accordance with 15 CFR 30.5(a) of the FTR. The Census Bureau will distribute the Letter of Intent to BIS and other agencies participating in the postdeparture approval process. Any agency may notify the Census Bureau that an applicant has failed to meet its acceptance standards, and the Census Bureau will provide a denial letter to the applicant naming the denying agency. If the Census Bureau receives neither notification of denial, nor a request for an extension from the agency within 30 days of the date of referral of the letter of intent to the agency, the applicant is deemed to be approved by that agency. (15 CFR 30.5(c) of the FTR).

      (b)  BIS will consider the grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status set forth in 15 CFR 30.5(c)(1) of the FTR, as well as the additional grounds for denial set forth in this paragraph.

      (1) Applicants have not been approved for postdeparture filing privileges by the Census Bureau or other agency;

      (2) Any party to the export transaction is contained on BIS's Denied Party, Entity Lists, [SDN], or Unverified List;

      (3) Exports are destined to a country in Country Group E:1 or E:2 (supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR);

      (4) Exports are made under License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA); are made under Authorization Validated End User (VEU); or are of 9x515 or “600 series” items.

      (5) Exports containing items that require a BIS license or have an ECCN controlled for reasons other than Anti-Terrorism only or Encryption Items.

      § 758.3   Responsibilities of parties to the transaction.

#### § § 758.3

      All parties that participate in transactions subject to the EAR must comply with the EAR. Parties are free to structure transactions as they wish, and to delegate functions and tasks as they deem necessary, as long as the transaction complies with the EAR. However, acting through a forwarding or other agent, or delegating or redelegating authority, does not in and of itself relieve anyone of responsibility for compliance with the EAR.

      (a)  The U.S. principal party in interest is the exporter, except in certain routed transactions. The exporter must determine licensing authority (License, License Exception, or NLR), and obtain the appropriate license or other authorization. The exporter may hire forwarding or other agents to perform various tasks, but doing so does not necessarily relieve the exporter of compliance responsibilities.

      (b)  All provisions of the EAR, including the end-use and end-user controls found in part 744 of the EAR, and the General Prohibitions found in part 736 of the EAR, apply to routed export transactions. The U.S. principal party in interest is the exporter and must determine licensing authority (License, License Exception, or NLR), and obtain the appropriate license or other authorization,  the U.S. principal party in interest obtains from the foreign principal party in interest a writing wherein the foreign principal party in interest expressly assumes responsibility for determining licensing requirements and obtaining license authority, making the U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest the exporter for EAR purposes. One writing may cover multiple transactions between the same principals. See § 748.4(a)(3) of the EAR.

      (c)  In routed export transactions where the foreign principal party in interest assumes responsibility for determining and obtaining licensing authority, the U.S. principal party in interest must, upon request, provide the foreign principal party in interest and its forwarding or other agent with the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), or with sufficient technical information to determine classification. In addition, the U.S. principal party in interest must provide the foreign principal party in interest or the foreign principal's agent any information that it knows will affect the determination of license authority, see § 758.1(g) of the EAR.

      (d)  In routed export transactions, a forwarding or other agent that represents the foreign principal party in interest, or who applies for a license on behalf of the foreign principal party in interest, must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal party in interest to act on its behalf. See § 748.4(b)(2) and § 758.1(h) of the EAR.

      § 758.4   Use of export license.

#### § § 758.4

      (a)  An export license issued by BIS authorizes exports from any port of export in the United States unless the license states otherwise. Items that leave the United States at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter the United States at another port before being exported to a foreign country, are treated as exports from the last U.S. port of export.

      (b)  Any item requiring a license that has not departed from the final U.S. port of export by midnight of the expiration date on an export license may not be exported under that license unless the shipment meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

      (1) BIS grants an extension; or

      (2) Prior to midnight on the date of expiration on the license, the items:

      (i) Were laden aboard the vessel;

      (ii) Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage, and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or

      (iii) The vessel was expected to be at the pier for loading before the license expired, but exceptional and unforseen circumstances delayed it, and BIS or the U.S. Customs Service makes a judgment that undue hardship would result if a license extension were required.

      (c)  If the consignee does not receive an export made under a license because the carrier failed to deliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical item, subject to the same limitations as to quantity and value as described on the license, to the same consignee and destination under the same license. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than the original consignee, the shipment is considered a new export and requires a new license. Before reshipping, satisfactory evidence of the original export and of the delivery failure, together with a satisfactory explanation of the delivery failure, must be submitted by the exporter to the following address: Operations Division, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 2099B, 14th Street & Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

      (d)  If you are exporting against a license with approved name changes under § 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR, prior to using that export license you are required to include in the respective name field in AES (e.g., in the USPPI name field in AES), the new name followed by the original name in this format “[new name] f.k.a. [original name].” This reporting requirement would be completed by the authorized filer of the electronic export information (EEI) in AES. Although not required, the exporter may include a copy of the BIS written response approving the non-material name changes in accordance with § 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR. If the items have already been exported against the license by the time the name changes are approved, you are not required to report this additional information in AES, but you still must follow the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.

      § 758.5   Conformity of documents and unloading of items.

#### § § 758.5

      (a)  The purpose of this section is to prevent items licensed for export from being diverted while in transit or thereafter. It also sets forth the duties of the parties when the items are unloaded in a country other than that of the ultimate consignee or end user as stated on the export license.

      (b)  When a license is issued by BIS, the information entered on related export control documents (e.g., Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing, bill of lading or air waybill) must be consistent with the license.

      (c) —(1)  No person may issue a bill of lading or air waybill that provides for delivery of licensed items to any foreign port located outside the country of an intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, or end user named on the BIS license and in the EEI filing.

      (2) —(i)  No person may issue a bill of lading or air waybill that provides for delivery of licensed items to optional ports of unloading unless all the optional ports are within the country of ultimate destination or are included on the BIS license and in the EEI filing.

      (ii)  For shipments of items that do not require a license, the exporter may designate optional ports of unloading in EEI filing and on other export control documents, so long as the optional ports are in countries to which the items could also have been exported without a license.

      (d)  No person may deliver items to any country other than the country of an intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, or end user named on the BIS license and EEI filing without prior written authorization from BIS, except for reasons beyond the control of the carrier (such as acts of God, perils of the sea, damage to the carrier, strikes, war, political disturbances or insurrection).

      (e) —(1)  When items are unloaded in a country to which the items could be exported without a license issued by BIS, no notification to BIS is required. However, any persons disposing of the items must continue to comply with the terms and conditions of any License Exception, and with any other relevant provisions of the EAR.

      (2)  (i) When items are unloaded in a country to which the items would require a BIS license, no person may effect delivery or entry of the items into the commerce of the country where unloaded without prior written approval from BIS. The carrier, in ensuring that the items do not enter the commerce of the country, may have to place the items in custody, or under bond or other guaranty. In addition, the carrier must inform the exporter and BIS of the unscheduled unloading in a time frame that will enable the exporter to submit its report within 10 days from the date of unscheduled unloading. The exporter must within 10 days of the unscheduled unloading report the facts to and request authorization for disposition from BIS using either: mail, fax, or E-mail. The report to BIS must include:

      (A) A copy of the manifest of the diverted cargo;

      (B) Identification of the place of unloading;

      (C) Statement that explains why the unloading was necessary; and

      (D) A proposal for disposition of the items and a request for authorization for such disposition from BIS.

      (ii)  U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Exporter Services, Room 2099B, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; phone number 202-482-0436; facsimile number 202-482-3322; and E-Mail address:

      § 758.6   Destination control statement and other information furnished to consignees.

#### § § 758.6

      (a) The exporter must incorporate the following information as an integral part of the commercial invoice whenever items on the Commerce Control List are shipped ( exported in tangible form), unless the shipment ( the tangible export) may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see part 740 of the EAR) or the item is designated as EAR99:

      (1) The following statement: “These items are controlled by the U.S. Government and authorized for export only to the country of ultimate destination for use by the ultimate consignee or end-user(s) herein identified. They may not be resold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, to any other country or to any person other than the authorized ultimate consignee or end-user(s), either in their original form or after being incorporated into other items, without first obtaining approval from the U.S. government or as otherwise authorized by U.S. law and regulations” and

      (2) The ECCN(s) for any 3A001.z, 3A090, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 9x515 or “600 series” “items” being shipped ( exported in tangible form). For the seven ECCNs with a .z paragraph, the requirement to include the classification only applies to commodities specified under the .z paragraphs. If the commodity is specified under any other paragraph in one of those seven ECCNs, then the requirement under this paragraph is not applicable. For ECCN 3A090, identify the commodity as either 3A090.a, .b, or .c.

      § 758.7   Authorities of the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement (OEE).

#### § § 758.7

      (a)  OEE officials and any other officials of the United States designated by OEE are authorized and directed to take appropriate action to enforce the authorities granted to the Secretary under the laws and regulations of the United States, including ECRA, 13 U.S.C. 305, 22 U.S.C. 401, 50 U.S.C. 1701  the EAR, and the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) (15 CFR part 30). This includes, but is not limited to, assuring that:

      (1) Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) without a license issued by BIS are either outside the scope of the license requirements of the EAR or authorized by a license exception and comply with the terms of the license exception;

      (2) Exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) purporting to be authorized by licenses issued by BIS are, in fact, so authorized and the transaction complies with the terms of the license;

      (3) Accurate EEI filings have been made for exports as required by this part, the FTR, and other federal regulations; and

      (4) The activities of U.S. persons, wherever located, which are subject to a license requirement pursuant to § 744.6 of the EAR, are authorized by and comply with the terms of a BIS license.

      (b)  In carrying out the authorities granted to, and exercised by, the Secretary pursuant to ECRA, 13 U.S.C. 305, 22 U.S.C. 401, 50 U.S.C. 1701  the EAR, the FTR, and other applicable laws and regulations of the United States, including the authority to control the export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of items, in any form, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, whether by U.S. or foreign persons; control the activities of U.S. persons, wherever located, as described in § 744.6 of the EAR; ensure compliance with export controls; monitor shipments and other means of transfer; conduct investigations; and issue orders, OEE officials and any other officials of the United States designated by OEE are authorized to take the types of enforcement actions described below.

      (1) —(i)  All items subject to export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary that have been, are being, or are about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) are subject to inspection, search, and detention. The scope of inspection may include, but is not limited to, item identification; technical appraisal (analysis) or both; verifying the accuracy of the EEI filing, or if there is no EEI filing, the air waybill, bill of lading or other loading document covering the item about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country); and verifying the value and quantity of such item.

      (ii)  Inspection, search, and detention may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.

      (iii)  Where, in the judgment of the official making the inspection, the item cannot be properly identified, a sample may be taken for more detailed examination or for laboratory analysis.

      (A)  The sample will be obtained by the official making the inspection in accordance with the provisions for sampling imported merchandise. The size of the sample will be the minimum representative amount necessary for identification or analysis. This will depend on such factors as the physical condition of the material (whether solid, liquid, or gas) and the size and shape of the container.

      (B)  When a sample is taken, the exporter, reexporter, or transferor, or their agent(s), and the ultimate consignee will be notified by letter from an OEE official, documenting the port of export, reexport, or other place of inspection, date of sampling, BIS license number (if any) or other authorization, invoice number, quantity of sample taken, description of item, marks and packing case numbers, and manufacturer's number for the item. A copy of the letter will be placed in the container that had been opened by the inspecting official, and a copy will be retained by the inspecting official's office.

      (C)  Samples will be disposed of in accordance with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection procedure for imported commodities.

      (2)  OEE officials are authorized to require any person subject to export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary, including, but not limited to, exporters, reexporters, transferors, or their agent(s), and owners and operators of carriers or their agents, as well as intermediate consignees, ultimate consignees, and end users, and their agent(s) to produce for inspection and copying any books, records and other information, including, but not limited to, invoices, orders, letters of credit, inspection reports, technical documentation, packing lists, shipping documents and instructions, and correspondence.

      (3)  OEE officials are authorized to question any person, including, but not limited to, the owner or operator of a carrier and the carrier's agent(s), as well as the exporter, reexporter, transferor (in-country), or their agent(s).

      (4)  OEE officials may prevent the lading of items on a conveyance.

      (5)  OEE officials are authorized to inspect, search, and detain any conveyance at any time to determine whether items have been, are being, or are about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country). Inspection, search, and detention of a conveyance may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.

      (6)  OEE officials are authorized to seize any property, tangible or intangible, when there is probable cause to believe that such property is subject to administrative forfeiture (nonjudicial civil forfeiture or summary forfeiture), civil judicial forfeiture, or criminal forfeiture. Seizures of property subject to forfeiture may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.

      (7)  OEE is authorized to initiate administrative forfeiture (nonjudicial civil forfeiture or summary forfeiture) proceedings and forfeit property in accordance with the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. 981(d) and the Customs laws (19 U.S.C. 1602 ).

      (8)  (i) All BIS actions taken to implement, administer, and enforce the authorities granted to the Secretary shall be conducted pursuant to the U.S. Constitution and all applicable laws and regulations, including judicially recognized exceptions to the requirement for a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment, for example, consent of the person to be searched, exigent circumstances, searches incident to a lawful arrest, and border searches.

      (ii) BIS may enter into any such agreements ( memoranda of understanding) with other Federal agencies as deemed necessary by BIS to execute the authorities set forth in this part in a lawful and orderly manner.

      (iii) BIS shall issue additional guidance as necessary to ensure the lawful and orderly execution of the Secretary's authorities.

      (iv) Nothing in this section is intended to limit or abridge BIS law enforcement officers from exercising their lawful authority in carrying out their official duties.

For the purpose of this section, furnishing a copy of the order to any person included within the definition of carrier will be sufficient notice of the order to the carrier. The carrier must, as ordered:

      (1) Unload the shipment and make it available to OEE officials for search and inspection; or

      (2) Return the shipment to the United States or cause it to be returned; or

      (3) Unload the shipment at a port of call and take steps to assure that it is placed in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter the commerce of any foreign country without the prior approval of BIS.

      (c)  The provisions of § 758.5(d) and (e) of this part, relating to reporting, notification to BIS, and the prohibition against unauthorized delivery or entry of the item into a foreign country shall apply also when items are unloaded at a port of call, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (d)  Upon discovery by any person included within the term “carrier,” as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, that a violation of the export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur with respect to a shipment on board, or otherwise in the possession or control of the carrier, such person must immediately notify both:

      (b)  (1) This part applies to _United States person_s. For purposes of this part, the term  means any person who is a United States resident or national, including individuals, domestic concerns, and “controlled in fact” foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreign establishments of domestic concerns. This definition of United States person includes both the singular and plural and, in addition, includes:

      (i) The government of the United States or any department, agency, or commission thereof;

      (ii) The government of any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any subdivision, department, agency, or commission of any such government;

      (iii) Any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity organized under the laws of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section;

      (iv) Any foreign concern's subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent establishment in any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States; and

      (v) Any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. (See paragraph (c) of this section on “Definition of ‘Controlled in Fact’.”)

      (2) The term  means any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws of, any jurisdiction named in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern.

      (3) The term  means any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws of, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

      (4) The term  does not include an individual United States national who is resident outside the United States and who is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-_United States person_ or assigned to work as an employee for, and under the direction and control of, a non-United States person.

      (c)  (1) This part applies to any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is  by such domestic concern.  consists of the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish the general policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment.

      (2) A foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will be presumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject to rebuttal by competent evidence, when:

      (i) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate;

      (ii) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether directly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the voting securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns or controls (whether directly or indirectly) an equal or larger percentage;

      (iii) The foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by the domestic concern pursuant to the provisions of an exclusive management contract;

      (iv) A majority of the members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate are also members of the comparable governing body of the domestic concern;

      (v) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the majority of the members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate; or

      (vi) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the chief operating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate.

      (3) A brokerage firm or other person which holds simple record ownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not be deemed to control the securities.

      (4) A domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly, securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holder or owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control those voting securities.

      (5) A domestic concern's foreign branch office or other unincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to be controlled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances.

      (d)

      (e)  (1) This part prohibits a United States person from taking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      (2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at least one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take a particular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of the reasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless of whether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons. Stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimate business reasons does not remove that action from the scope of this part if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also a reason for the action.

      (3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of any of the prohibitions under § 760.2. It is not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibited by this part. It is essential that one take such action with intent to comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takes a prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part.

      (4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one's behavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or supported. But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited action was taken must be established.

      (5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. For example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to comply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagree with or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to be furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the other hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior product, the requisite intent does not exist.

      (6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with an unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew that such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On the other hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a blacklisted person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate the existence of the requisite intent.

      (7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists, all available evidence will be examined.

      § 760.2   Prohibitions.

#### § § 760.2

      (a)

      (1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse, require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.

      (2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is boycott-based.

      (3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur when a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity and declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.

      (4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called “blacklist”) or a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called “whitelist”) constitutes a refusal to do business.

      (5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a clause. (But see § 760.4 of this part on “Evasion.”)

      (6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager chooses one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager's actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. However, it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a United States person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the firm is a part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of the countries in which they are performed, and the United States person, in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that are boycott-based. For example, a United States person under contract to provide general management services in connection with a construction project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted.

      (7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice, executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection and shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action to effect the client's choice. (But see § 760.3(d) on “Compliance with Unilateral Selection” as it may apply to post-award services.)

      (8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on behalf of, a boycotting country.

      (9) Agreements under this section may be either express or implied by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting country.

      (10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national(s) or resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not indicate the existence of the required intent.

      (b)

      (1) No United States person may:

      (i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any individual who is a United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin;

      (ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organization which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such corporation or organization;

      (iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or

      (iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country. This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      (3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the civil rights laws of the United States.

      (c)

      (1) No United States person may:

      (i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person;

      (ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United States person;

      (iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or

      (iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United States person.

      (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information is specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United States person. It shall also apply whether the information requested or volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative.

      (3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality of the parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, as does information in the form of code words or symbols which could identify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.

      (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      (d)

      (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information concerning his or any other person's past, present or proposed business relationships:

      (i) With or in a boycotted country;

      (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country;

      (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or

      (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.

      (2) This prohibition shall apply:

      (i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationship involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercial representation; shipping or other transportation transaction; insurance; investment; or any other type of business transaction or relationship; and

      (ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the United States person.

      (3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context. Normal business information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and trade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear in specifications or statements of experience and qualifications.

      (4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience), the information may be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be used, for boycott purposes. However, no information about business relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted countries, their residents or nationals, may be furnished in response to a boycott request, even if the information is publicly available. Requests for such information from a boycott office will be presumed to be boycott-based.

      (5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      (e)

      (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a boycotted country.

      (2) This prohibition shall apply whether:

      (i) The information concerns association with or involvement in any charitable or fraternal organization which (a) has, as one of its stated purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial contributions or other means, or (b) undertakes, as a major organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a boycotted country;

      (ii) The information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the United States person; or

      (iii) The information requested or volunteered concerns membership in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with or involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal organization.

      (3) This prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      (f)

      (1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any United States person, as a result of the application of this section, be obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit.

      (2) For purposes of this section, “implementing” a letter of credit includes:

      (i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a customer;

      (ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit, any letter of credit;

      (iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for payment by the beneficiary;

      (iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible for payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer;

      (v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a draft from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to the issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and

      (vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit.

      (3) In the standard international letter of credit transaction facilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, a bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United States exporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of credit provides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment to the beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentation specified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includes commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.

      Banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.

      (4) A United States person is not prohibited under this section from advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in his favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of a letter of credit which it is prohibited from implementing.

      (5) Compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit. This section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any obligations or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or regulations, except as may be explicitly provided in this section.

      (6) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities taken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. In addition, it applies only when the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is in United States commerce and the beneficiary is a United States person.

      (7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United States person located in the United States, including a permanent United States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in United States commerce.

      (8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United States person located in the United States does not specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreign address.

      (9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a United States person located outside the United States will be presumed to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States address for the beneficiary and calls for documents indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in United States commerce.

      (10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a United States person located outside the United States does not specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition, where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods are of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies will be presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption that the beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside United States commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in United States commerce.

      § 760.3   Exceptions to prohibitions.

#### § § 760.3

      (a)

      (1) A United States person, in supplying goods or services to a boycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of such boycotting country which prohibit the import of:

      (i) Goods or services from the boycotted country;

      (ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or

      (iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents of the boycotted country.

      (2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with such import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request to comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactions involving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country.

      (3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a United States person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he can supply. (See § 760.2(d) of this part on “Furnishing Information About Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons” and paragraph (c) of this section on “Import and Shipping Document Requirements.”)

      (b)

      (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that country which prohibit the shipment of goods:

      (i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or

      (ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment.

      (2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agree to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a boycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows, or has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods to the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the boycotting country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the purchaser of the shipment:

      (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a port of the boycotted country; or

      (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include a port in the boycotted country.

      (3) For purposes of this exception, the term  means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country or by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.

      (c)

      (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping document requirements of that country, with respect to:

      (i) The country or origin of the goods;

      (ii) The name and nationality of the carrier;

      (iii) The route of the shipment;

      (iv) The name, residence, or address of the supplier of the shipment;

      (v) The name, residence, or address of the provider of other services.

      (2) Such information must be stated in positive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except for information with respect to the names or nationalities of carriers or routes of shipment, which may continue to be stated in negative terms in conjunction with shipments to a boycotting country, in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks or confiscation.

      (d)

      (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident of a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and customary that a not insignificant part of the services be performed within the boycotting country. With respect to goods, the items, in the normal course of business, must be identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by (a) uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.

      (2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a United States person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. It does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is permitted; that question is covered, with respect to United States persons, in paragraph (g) of this section on “Compliance with Local Law.” Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is the recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing in this part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling an order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis (e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himself take any action prohibited by this part.

      (3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with which a United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral and specific.

      (4) A “specific” selection is one which is stated in the affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or services.

      (5) A “unilateral” selection is one in which the discretion in making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. If the United States person who receives a unilateral selection has provided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance (including information for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on a boycott basis), then the buyer's selection is not unilateral, and compliance with that selection by a United States person does not come within this exception.

      (6) The provision of so-called “pre-selection” or “pre-award” services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers, subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not boycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services must be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm (or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services are not customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons from participating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for such participation, then the services may not be provided without destroying the unilateral character of any subsequent selection.

      (7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a national or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be a United States person. For purposes of this exception, a United States person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency is temporary.

      (8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include:

      (i) Physical presence in the country;

      (ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;

      (iii) Continuity of the residency;

      (iv) Intent to maintain the residency;

      (v) Prior residence in the country;

      (vi) Size and nature of presence in the country;

      (vii) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country;

      (viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and

      (ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities.

      (9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually making the selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent, subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the meaning of this exception.

      (10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely transmitted by another person to a United States person for execution is a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this exception.

      (11) If a United States person receives, from another person located in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by a boycotting country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the selection is made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the transmitting person to determine who actually made the selection. If he knows or has reason to know that the selection was made by other than a boycotting country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country, he may not comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United States person recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott restrictions will create a duty to inquire.

      (12) If the United States person does not know or have reason to know that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliance with such a selection does not offend any prohibition and this exception is not needed.

      (13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and suppliers of services to be performed “within the boycotting country.” Services to be performed wholly within the United States or wholly within any country other than the boycotting country are not covered.

      (14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed “within the boycotting country” only if they are of a type which would customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within the country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not insignificant part of the total services performed.

      (15) What is “customary and necessary” for these purposes depends on the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industry of which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are instituted to accommodate this part.

      (16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of goods—goods that, in the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country. The definition of “specifically identifiable goods” is the same under this section as it is in paragraph (g) of this section on “Compliance with Local Law.”

      (17) Goods “specifically identifiable” in the normal course of business are those items which at the time of their entry into a boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by uniqueness of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging. Goods are “specifically identifiable” in the normal course of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether inspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be “specifically identifiable” in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this part.

      (18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in paragraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving the unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, no United States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.

      (e)

      (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or transshipments of exports to:

      (i) A boycotted country;

      (ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;

      (iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country; or

      (iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.

      (2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country; on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, including those located in third countries.

      (3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the vendor of the shipment:

      (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or

      (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include the boycotted country.

      (4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country.

      (f)

      (1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply with the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements for employment within the boycotting country, provided that he furnishes information only about himself or a member of his family, and not about any other United States individual, including his employees, employers, or co-workers.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a  means a person who is a resident or national of the United States.  means immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse, children, and other dependents living in the individual's home.

      (3) A United States person may not furnish information about its employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his own to any request for information relating to immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements. A United States person may also perform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by individuals. These include informing employees of boycotting country visa requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation, messenger and similar services; and assisting in or arranging for the expeditious processing of applications. All such actions must be undertaken on a non-discriminatory basis.

      (4) A United States person may proceed with a project in a boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other prospective participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott reasons. But no employees or other participants may be selected in advance in a manner designed to comply with a boycott.

      (g)  (1) This exception contains two parts. The first covers compliance with local law with respect to a United States person's activities exclusively within a foreign country; the second covers compliance with local import laws by United States persons resident in a foreign country. Under both parts of this exception, local laws are laws of the host country, whether derived from statutes, regulations, decrees, or other official sources having the effect of law in the host country. This exception is not available for compliance with presumed policies or understandings of policies unless those policies are reflected in official sources having the effect of law.

      (2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United States persons resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception, a United States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign country only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide resident of a foreign country even if such person's residency is temporary.

      (3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country include:

      (A) Physical presence in the country;

      (B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;

      (C) Continuity of the residency;

      (D) Intent to maintain the residency;

      (E) Prior residence in the country;

      (F) Size and nature of presence in the country;

      (G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country;

      (H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and

      (I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities.

      (ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is dispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined to ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona fide residency.

      (h)  (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively within that country. These activities include:

      (i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws;

      (ii) Employing residents of the host country;

      (iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the host country;

      (iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents of the host country; and

      (v) Furnishing information within the host country.

      (2) Activities exclusively within the country do not include importing goods or services from outside the host country, and, therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with import laws in connection with importing goods or services.

      (i)  (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may, in importing goods, materials or components into that country, comply or agree to comply with the import laws of that country, provided that:

      (i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performing contractual services within that country; and

      (ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the foreign country by:

      (a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or

      (b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.

      (2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are those set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residence of a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on such United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a United States company's employee in a foreign country does not confer such residence on the entire company.

      (3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may take action under this exception through an agent outside the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident and not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United States person resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a boycotting country's import law with respect to the importation of qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on the action to be taken, but the United States agent himself may not exercise any discretion.

      (4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical to the test applied in paragraph (d) of this section on “Compliance With Unilateral and Specific Selection” to determine whether they are identifiable as to their source or origin in the normal course of business.

      (5) The availability of this exception for the import of goods depends on whether the goods are intended for the United States person's own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend upon who has title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign country.

      (6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including the performance of contractual services within the foreign country) if:

      (i) They are to be consumed by the United States person;

      (ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possession and to be used by that person;

      (iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performing contractual services for another;

      (iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into, refined into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured for another; or

      (v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a functional part of, a project to be constructed for another.

      (7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are not for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for another are not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurement services is the business in which the United States person is customarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired for one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in the retail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey project are not for one's own use if they are not customarily incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as a functional part of the project.

      (8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to the import of services, even when the United States person importing such services is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is importing them for his own use. In addition, this exception is available for a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country only when the individual or entity actually present within that country takes action through the exercise of his own discretion.

      (9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continually reviewed to determine whether its continued availability is consistent with the national interest. Its availability may be limited or withdrawn as appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability of this exception, the effect that the inability to comply with local import laws would have on the economic and other relations of the United States with boycotting countries will be considered.

      (10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may comply or agree to comply with the host country's import laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws are boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply or agree to comply with any host country law which would require him to discriminate against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, or to supply information about any United States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.

      § 760.4   Evasion.

#### § § 760.4

      (a) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part. Nor may any United States person assist another United States person to violate or evade the provisions of this part.

      (b) The exceptions set forth in § 760.3(a) through (i) do not permit activities or agreements (express or implied by a course of conduct, including a pattern of responses) which are otherwise prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent of such exceptions. However, activities within the coverage and intent of the exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasion regardless of how often such exceptions are utilized.

      (c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to place a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special burdens because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott reasons from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting country will be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part.

      (d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute evasion. If they are introduced after January 18, 1978, their use will be presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such a provision is in customary usage without distinction between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that there is a legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the other hand, use of such a provision by a United States person subsequent to January 18, 1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision had been customarily used by that person prior to January 18, 1978.

      (e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited activity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasion under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a United States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying with prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person's structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the prohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of an arrangement or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether appearances conform to reality.

      § 760.5   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 760.5

      (a)  (1) A United States person who receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States or against any United States person must report such request to the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a United States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or restrictive trade practice.

      (i) A request received by a United States person located in the United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under § 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and (18) of this part.

      (ii) A request received by a United States person located outside the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under § 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under § 760.1(d)(6) through (17) and (19) of this part.

      (iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a particular transaction or activity, received by any United States person is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under § 760.1(d) of this part.

      (3) These reporting requirements apply to all United States persons. They apply whether the United States person receiving the request is an exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States person subject to this part.

      (4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this section. In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.

      (5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and precise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not reportable:

      (i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.

      (ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to certify to either effect.

      (iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the country of origin of goods.

      (iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped or the name of the provider of services.

      (v) A request to comply with the laws of another country except where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's boycott laws.

      (vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himself or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment purposes.

      (vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a particular destination.

      (viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.

      (ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address of such agent.

      (x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any reason (“risk of loss clause”) if such clause was in use by the purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.

      (6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part.

      (7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are outside United States commerce. The information requested will include the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including the names of those surveyed, will be made public.

      (b)  (1) Each reportable request must be reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is received.

      (2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportable request must report that request. However, such person may designate someone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, may report on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may report on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person designated to report a request received by another receives an identical request directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the other person.

      (3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone reporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an identical request in connection with the same transaction.

      (4) Reports may be submitted by mail or electronically. Mailed paper reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6098, Washington, DC 20230. Electronic reports must be submitted in duplicate, by following the prompts on the screen, through the Office of Antiboycott Compliance Web page of the BIS Web site,  Each submission, whether paper or electronic, must be made in accordance with the following requirements:

      (i) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located in the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received ( April 30 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).

      (ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located outside the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received ( May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).

      (5) Mailed paper reports may, at the reporting person's option, be submitted on either a single transaction form (Form BIS-621P, Report of Request for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott, Single Transaction, (revised 10-89)) or on a multiple transaction form (Form BIS-6051P, Report of Request for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott, Multiple Transactions, (revised 10-89)). Electronic reports may be submitted only on the single transaction form, which will electronically reproduce the reporting person's identifying information to facilitate reporting of multiple transactions.

      (6) Reports, whether submitted on the paper single transaction form or on the paper multiple transaction form, or submitted electronically, must contain entries for every applicable item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take or has taken the action requested. If the reporting person has not decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing a report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person.

      (7) Each report of a boycott request, whether submitted by mail or electronically, must be accompanied by two copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request appears ( paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For mail submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in paper format to the report form; for electronic submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in PDF format to the electronic submission. Reports, whether paper or electronic, may also be accompanied by any additional information relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide concerning his response to the request. For electronic submissions, such additional information should be provided as a PDF attachment.

      (8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional recordkeeping requirements.)

      (c)  (1) Reports of requests received on or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles, materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying document(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed except upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy of the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the disclosure would not place the United States person involved at a competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national interest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of Commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be honored.

      (2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity to delete the same information which it certified in the report would place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy information that is considered confidential and that is not required to be contained in the report (e.g., information related to foreign consignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend “Public Inspection Copy.” With respect to documents accompanying reports received by the Department on or after July 1, 1979, the public inspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not it has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided by this paragraph.

      (3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the public for inspection and copying are located in the BIS Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that facility.

      (4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.

      § 762.1   Scope.

#### § § 762.1

      In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.

      (a)  The recordkeeping provisions of this part apply to the following transactions:

      (1) Transactions involving restrictive trade practices or boycotts described in part 760 of the EAR;

      (2) Exports of commodities, software, or technology from the United States and any known reexports, transfers (in-country), transshipment, or diversions of items exported from the United States;

      (3) Exports to Canada, if, at any stage in the transaction, it appears that a person in a country other than the United States or Canada has an interest therein, or that the item involved is to be reexported, transshipped, or diverted from Canada to another foreign country; or

      (4) Any other transactions subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to, the prohibitions against servicing, forwarding and other actions for or on behalf of end-users of proliferation concern contained in §§ 736.2(b)(7) and 744.6 of the EAR. This part also applies to all negotiations connected with those transactions, except that for export control matters a mere preliminary inquiry or offer to do business and negative response thereto shall not constitute negotiations, unless the inquiry or offer to do business proposes a transaction that a reasonably prudent exporter would believe likely to lead to a violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.

      (b)  Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who, as principal or agent (including a forwarding agent), participates in any transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section, and any person in the United States or abroad who is required to make and maintain records under any provision of the EAR, shall keep and maintain all records described in § 762.2 of this part that are made or obtained by that person and shall produce them in a manner provided by § 762.7 of this part.

      § 762.4   Original records required.

#### § § 762.4

      The regulated person must maintain the original records in the form in which that person receives or creates them unless that person meets all of the conditions of § 762.5 of this part relating to reproduction of records. If the original record does not meet the standards of legibility and readability described in § 762.5 of this part and the regulated person intends to rely on that record to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the EAR, that person must retain the original record. With respect to documents that BIS issues to a party in SNAP-R, either an electronically stored copy in a format that makes the document readable with software possessed by that party or a paper print out of the complete document is deemed to be an original record for purposes of this section.

> [61 FR 12900, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 75 FR 17055, Apr. 5, 2010]

      § 762.5   Reproduction of original records.

      (2) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, information, and other characteristics of the original record, including both obverse and reverse sides of paper documents in legible form.

      (3) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, the records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. (For purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of a letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable and readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognized as complete words or numbers.)

      (4) The system must preserve the initial image (including both obverse and reverse sides of paper documents) and record all changes, who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially recorded.

      (5) The regulated person must establish written procedures to identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and maintenance of the system.

      (6) The regulated person must establish written procedures for inspection and quality assurance of records in the system and document the implementation of those procedures.

      (8) The regulated person must keep a record of where, when, by whom, and on what equipment the records and other information were entered into the system.

      (9) Upon request by the Office of Export Enforcement, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, or any other agency of competent jurisdiction, the regulated person must furnish, at the examination site, the records, the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating, reading, and reproducing any record in the system.

      (c)  For systems based on the storage of digital images, the system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system. With respect to records of transactions, including those involving restrictive trade practices or boycott requirements or requests. The system must be able to locate and reproduce all records relating to a particular transaction based on any one of the following criteria:

      (1) The name(s) of the parties to the transaction;

      (2) Any country(ies) connected with the transaction; or

      (3) A document reference number that was on any original document.

      (d)  For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature photographic processes, the regulated person must maintain a detailed index of all records in the system that is arranged in such a manner as to allow immediate location of any particular record in the system.

      § 762.6   Period of retention.

      § 762.7   Producing and inspecting records.

#### § § 762.7

      (a)  Persons located in the United States may be asked to produce books, records, and other information that are required to be kept by any provision of the EAR, or any license, order, or authorization issued thereunder and to make them available for inspection and copying by any authorized official of the BIS, or any other official of the United States designated by BIS, without any charge or expense to such official.

      (f) [Reserved]

      (g)  (1) No person may make any false or misleading representation, statement, or certification, or falsify or conceal any material fact, either directly to BIS or an official of any other United States agency, or indirectly through any other person:

      § 764.3   Sanctions.

#### § § 764.3

      (a)  Violations of ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder are subject to the administrative sanctions described in this section and to any other liability, sanction, or penalty available under law. The protective administrative measures that are described in § 764.6 of this part are distinct from administrative sanctions.

      (1)  (i) A civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in ECRA may be imposed for each violation, and in the event that any provision of the EAR is continued or revised by IEEPA or any other authority, the maximum monetary civil penalty for each violation shall be that provided by such other authority.

      (ii) The payment of any civil penalty may be made a condition, for a period not exceeding two years after the imposition of such penalty, to the granting, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license, license exception, permission, or privilege granted or to be granted to the person upon whom such penalty is imposed.

      (iii) The payment of any civil penalty may be deferred or suspended in whole or in part during any probation period that may be imposed. Such deferral or suspension shall not bar the collection of the penalty if the conditions of the deferral, suspension, or probation are not fulfilled.

      (2)  An order may be issued that restricts the ability of the named persons to engage in exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) involving items subject to the EAR, or that restricts access by named persons to items subject to the EAR. An order denying export privileges may be imposed either as a sanction for a violation of ECRA, the EAR, or any other statute set forth at 50 U.S.C. 4819(e)(1)(B); or as a protective administrative measure described in § 764.6(c) or (d) of this part. An order denying export privileges may suspend or revoke any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to a person named in the denial order or in which such person has an interest; may deny or restrict exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) by or to such person of any item subject to the EAR; and may restrict dealings in which that person may benefit from any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of such items. The standard terms of a denial order are set forth in supplement no. 1 to this part. A non-standard denial order, narrower in scope, may be issued. Authorization to engage in actions otherwise prohibited by a denial order may be given by the Office of Exporter Services, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, upon a written request by a person named in the denial order or by a person seeking permission to deal with a named person. Submit such requests to: Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Exporter Services, Room 2099b, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20230.

      (3)  Any person acting as an attorney, accountant, consultant, freight forwarder, or in any other representative capacity for any license application or other matter before BIS may be excluded by order from any or all such activities before BIS.

      (b)  Whoever willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or willfully conspires to commit, or aids and abets in the commission of, an unlawful act described in 50 U.S.C. 4819(a) shall be fined not more than $1,000,000; and in the case of the individual, shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.

      (c)  Conduct that violates ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license, or authorization issued thereunder, and other conduct specified in sections 11A, B, and C of the EAA may be subject to sanctions or other measures in addition to criminal and administrative sanctions under ECRA or the EAR. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (1)  Statutorily-mandated sanctions may be imposed on account of specified conduct related to weapons proliferation. Such statutory sanctions are not civil or criminal penalties, but restrict imports and procurement (See section 11A of the EAA, Multilateral Export Control Violations, and section 11C of the EAA, Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation), or restrict export licenses (See section 11B of the EAA, Missile Proliferation Violations, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992).

      (2) —(i)  Any property seized pursuant to export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary is subject to forfeiture. (50 U.S.C. 4819(d) and 4820(j); 22 U.S.C. 401; and 13 U.S.C. 305).

      (ii)  (A) The Department of State may not issue licenses or approvals for the export or reexport of defense articles and defense services controlled under the Arms Export Control Act to persons convicted of criminal offenses specified at 22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(1)(A), or to persons denied export privileges by BIS or another agency; and may deny such licenses or approvals where the applicant is indicted for, or any party to the export is convicted of, those specified criminal offenses. (22 CFR 126.7(a) and 127.11(a)).

      (B) The Department of Defense, among other agencies, may suspend the right of any person to contract with the United States Government based on export control violations. (Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 CFR 9.407-2).

      (a)  If a person learns that an export control violation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:

      (b)  Failure to report potential violations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses or exports without the required licenses to the detriment of the interests of the United States.

      (c)  The reporting provisions in paragraph (a) of this section are not “reporting requirements” within the meaning of § 764.2(i) of this part.

      (d)  Reporting requirements for activities within the scope of § 764.2(e) that involve items subject to the EAR which may have been illegally exported or reexported to Libya prior to the lifting of the comprehensive embargo on Libya are found in § 764.7 of the EAR.

      § 764.5   Voluntary self-disclosure.

#### § § 764.5

      (a)  BIS strongly encourages disclosure to the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) if you believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. As described in supplement no. 1 to part 766, voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor, and a firm's deliberate decision not to disclose significant apparent violations is an aggravating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by OEE. A deliberate decision not to disclose occurs when a firm uncovers a significant apparent violation that it has committed but then chooses not to file a VSD.

      (b)  (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to disclosures of violations relating to part 760 of the EAR.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to OEE for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of the export control provisions of the EAR.

      (3) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any other agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or substantially similar information from another source and has commenced an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.

      (4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by OEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEE would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the Department of Justice.

      (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.

      (c) —(1)  Any person wanting to voluntarily disclose a minor or technical violation should submit an abbreviated narrative report, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A minor or technical violation is one that does not contain any aggravating factors present as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766. Examples of minor or technical violations include, but are not limited to, immaterial Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing errors, inadvertent record keeping violations resulting from failed file retrieval or retention mechanisms ( physical damage caused by flood or fire and/or electronic corruption due to malware, virus, or outage), incorrect use of one license exception where other license exceptions were available, etc.

      (2)  The abbreviated narrative report should be submitted by email to  or in writing to the address in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The email subject line should include the word “abbreviated” if it is an abbreviated VSD.:

      (i) The notification should include:

      (A) The name of the person making the disclosure and should designate a contact person regarding the abbreviated narrative report and provide that contact person's current business street address, email address, and telephone number; and

      (B) A description of the general nature and extent of the violations (including, but not limited to, the destination and parties involved in any transaction, and the number, classification, and value of any items involved). Parties may itemize the various minor or technical violations in list or spreadsheet form.

      (ii) The Director of OEE at their discretion may request a full narrative report pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section if OEE suspects the presence of aggravating factors which will be due in 180 days from the date of the OEE Director's request.

      (3)  Parties may bundle multiple minor or technical violations into one overarching submission, if the violations occurred within the preceding quarter. Parties may submit such minor or technical violations into a single VSD submission on a quarterly basis using the abbreviated narrative account process identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (d) —(1)  Any person wanting to voluntarily disclose a significant violation should, in the manner outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, initially notify OEE as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where violations are suspected. A significant violation is one that involves one or more aggravating factors as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766. Those unsure of whether their possible disclosure relates to a minor or technical violation, or a significant violation, should follow the procedure in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for a significant violation.

      (2) —(i)  The initial notification should be submitted by email to  or in writing to the address in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations and should designate a contact person regarding the initial notification and provide that contact person's current business street address, email address, and telephone number. The notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will not be practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example, written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the United States without the required license, yet there is still an opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized persons. In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at the office listed in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.

      (ii)  For purposes of calculating when a complete narrative account must be submitted under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the initial notification date is the date the notification is received by OEE. OEE will notify the disclosing party in writing of the date that it receives the initial notification. At OEE's discretion, such writing from OEE may be on paper, or in an email message or facsimile transmission from OEE, or by any other method for the transmission of written communications. Where it is not practical to make an initial notification in writing, the person making the notification should confirm the oral notification in writing as soon as possible.

      (iii)  The full narrative account required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section must be received by OEE within 180 days of the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, absent an extension from the Director of OEE. If the person making the initial notification subsequently completes and submits to OEE the narrative account required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section such that OEE receives it within 180 days of the initial notification date, or within the additional time, if any, granted by the Director of OEE pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the disclosure, including violations disclosed in the narrative account that were not expressly mentioned in the initial notification, will be deemed to have been made on the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the initial notification was made in compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Failure to meet the deadline (either the initial 180-day deadline or an extended deadline granted by the Director of OEE) would not be an additional violation of the EAR, but such failure may reduce or eliminate the mitigating impact of the voluntary disclosure under supplement no. 1 to this part. For purposes of determining whether the deadline has been met under this paragraph, a complete narrative account must contain all of the pertinent information called for in paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section, and the voluntary self-disclosure must otherwise meet the requirements of this section.

      (iv)  The Director of OEE may extend the 180-day deadline upon a determination in his or her discretion that U.S. Government interests would be served by an extension or that the person making the initial notification has shown that more than 180 days is reasonably needed to complete the narrative account.

      (A)  The Director of OEE in his or her discretion may place conditions on the approval of an extension. For example, the Director of OEE may require that the disclosing person agree to toll the statute of limitations with respect to violations disclosed in the initial notification or discovered during the review for or preparation of the narrative account, and/or require the disclosing person to undertake specified interim remedial compliance measures.

      (B)  () In most instances _1_80 days should be adequate to complete the narrative account. Requests to extend the 180-day deadline set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section will be determined by the Director of OEE pursuant to his or her authority under this paragraph (d)(2)(iv) based upon his consideration and evaluation of U.S. Government interests and the facts and circumstances surrounding the request and any related investigations. Such requests should show specifically that the person making the request:

      () Began _i_ts review promptly after discovery of the violations;

      () Has been conducting its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected, consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy;

      () Reasonably needs the requested extension despite having begun its review promptly after discovery of the violations and having conducted its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy; and

      () Has considered whether interim compliance or other correct_iv_e measures may be needed and has undertaken such measures as appropriate to prevent recurring or additional violations.

      () Such requests also should set out a proposed timeline for completion and submission of the narrative account that is reasonable under the applicable facts and circumstances and should also designate a contact person regarding the request and provide that contact person's current business street address, email address, and telephone number. Requests may also include additional information that the person making the request reasonably believes is pertinent to the request under the applicable facts and circumstances.

      (C)  Requests for an extension should be made before the 180-day deadline and as soon as possible once a disclosing person determines that it will be unable to meet the deadline or the extended deadline where an extension previously has been granted, and possesses the information needed to prepare an extension request in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Requests for extension that are not received before the deadline for completing the narrative account has passed will not be considered. Parties who request an extension shortly before the deadline incur the risk that the Director of OEE will be unable to consider the request, determine whether or not to grant the extension, and communicate his or her decision before the deadline, and that any subsequently submitted narrative account will be considered untimely under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (3)  After the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of export-related transactions where violations with potentially aggravating factors are suspected (as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766). OEE recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive consideration under this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the EAR or other provision of law requires disclosure. Upon completion of the review, OEE should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The narrative account should include:

      (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges;

      (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;

      (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations;

      (iv) License numbers;

      (v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN or other classification of the items involved; and

      (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.

      (4)  (i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including:

      (A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications, import certificates and end-user statements;

      (B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, air waybills, bills of lading and packing lists; and

      (C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures.

      (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requests them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been made. After a final decision, the documents should be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR (15 CFR part 762).

      (5)  A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. § 764.2(g), relating to false or misleading representations, applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section.

      (6)  OEE believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure.

      (7)  The information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted by email to  or mailed to: Director, Office of Export Enforcement, 1401 Constitution Ave., Room H4514, Washington, DC 20230, Tel: (202) 482-5036.

      (e)  (1) For VSDs that involve minor or technical infractions, including abbreviated VSDs, OEE will generally resolve the VSD within 60 days of a final VSD submission with one of the actions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (i) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action; or

      (ii) Issue a warning letter.

      (2) For VSDs that indicate significant violations, OEE will conduct an investigation, and as quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE may take any of the following actions:

      (i) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action;

      (ii) Issue a warning letter;

      (iii) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to § 766.18 of the EAR and attempt to settle the matter;

      (iv) Issue a charging letter pursuant to § 766.3 of the EAR if a settlement is not reached; and/or

      (v) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.

      (f)  Supplement no. 1 to part 766 describes how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case.

      (g)  (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a violation of ECRA or the EAR has occurred has violated § 764.2(e).

      (i) Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows that a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that a voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may request permission from BIS to engage in the activities described in § 764.2(e) that would otherwise be prohibited.

      (ii) Any person may also notify the Director of OEE that a violation has occurred and request permission from BIS to engage in the activities described in § 764.2(e) that would otherwise be prohibited.

      (iii) Actions to return to the United States an item that has been unlawfully exported and disclosed under this section only require notification to the Director of OEE. Items subject to a violation that have been returned to the United States do not require further authorization under this paragraph (g) for future activities, provided that those future activities comply with any applicable EAR requirements.

      (2) How to submit a request under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section: A request should be submitted on letterhead, signed, and sent to the Director of the Office of Exporter

      (3) If a request submitted pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultation with OEE, future activities with respect to those items that would otherwise violate § 764.2(e) will not constitute violations.

      (4)  To reexport or transfer (in-country) items that are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure or notification, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions of ECRA or the EAR, authorization may be requested from BIS in accordance with the provisions of part 748 of the EAR (15 CFR part 748). If the applicant who submitted the reexport or transfer authorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure or notification, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosure or notification was made in connection with the export of the items for which authorization is sought and a copy of the voluntary self-disclosure or notification should be included with the license application.

      (5)  Disclosures and notifications of AES filing errors reported to OEE under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, where no other violation of the EAR only require notification to OEE and do not require authorization under this paragraph (g) to engage in activities subject to the EAR. The AES filing must be corrected with the Census Bureau before proceeding with such activities provided the activities meet any applicable EAR requirements. If another violation, such as failure to obtain a required license, has occurred in addition to the AES filing error, authorization under this paragraph (g) is required.

      (a)  As provided in § 740.2(b) of the EAR, all License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation.

      (b)  As provided in § 750.8 of the EAR, all licenses are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation.

      (c)  BIS may, in accordance with § 766.24 of the EAR, issue an order temporarily denying export privileges when such an order is necessary in the public interest to prevent the occurrence of an imminent violation.

      (d)  BIS may, in accordance with § 766.25 of the EAR, issue an order denying the export privileges of any person who has been convicted of an offense specified in § 11(h) of the EAA.

      § 764.7   Activities involving items that may have been illegally exported or reexported to Libya.

#### § § 764.7

      (a)  As set forth in § 764.2(e) of this part, and restated in General Prohibition Ten at § 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR, no person (including a non-U.S. Third Party) may order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, sell, loan, dispose of, transfer, finance, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, any item subject to the EAR with knowledge that a violation has occurred, or will occur, in connection with the item. This section addresses the application of § 764.2(e) of this part to activities involving items subject to the EAR that may have been illegally exported or reexported to Libya before the comprehensive embargo on Libya ended (April 29, 2004) (“installed base” items).

      (b) —(1)  Subject to the reporting requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, activities within the scope of § 764.2(e) of this part involving installed base items described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section that are located in _Libya_ and that were exported or reexported before April 29, 2004 do not require a license from BIS.

      (i)  An installed base item is within the scope of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if:

      (A) It is not on the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR;

      (B) It is on the Commerce Control List, but is authorized for export or reexport pursuant to a License Exception to Libya; or

      (C) It is on the Commerce Control List and controlled only for AT reasons or for NS and AT reasons only, and is not listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement's Sensitive List (Annex 1) or Very Sensitive List (Annex 2) posted on the Wassenaar Arrangement's Web site () at the Control Lists web page.

      (ii)  Any person engaging in activity described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must submit to BIS's Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) a report including all known material facts with respect to how the installed base item arrived in Libya. The report must be submitted to OEE at the address identified in § 764.4(a) of the EAR within ninety (90) days of the first activity relating to the installed base item in Libya. A report may address more than one activity and/or more than one installed base item. An additional report must be submitted if any new material information regarding the export or reexport to Libya of the installed base item is discovered.

      (2) —(i)  Any person seeking to undertake activities within the scope of § 764.2(e) of the EAR with respect to any installed base item located in Libya and not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section must obtain a license from BIS prior to engaging in any such activities. License applications should be submitted in accordance with §§ 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR, and should fully describe the relevant activity within the scope of § 764.2(e) of this part which is the basis of the application. License applications should include all known material facts as to how the installed base item originally was exported or reexported to Libya. This section also applies if you know that an item to be exported or reexported to a third party will be used on an installed base item not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

      (ii)  BIS will review license applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section on a case-by-case basis. Favorable consideration will be given for those applications related to civil end-uses in Libya. Applications related to military, police, intelligence, or other sensitive end-uses in Libya will be subject to a general policy of denial.

      (3)  The provisions of this section are not applicable to any activities within the scope of § 764.2(e) of the EAR undertaken with respect to an installed base item in Libya by a person who was party to the original illegal export or reexport of the related installed base item to Libya. Such persons should voluntarily self-disclose violations pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 764.5 of this part, which in some cases may allow activities related to unlawfully exported or reexported items to be undertaken based on permission from BIS.

      (4)  Notwithstanding this section, a license may be required pursuant to another provision of the EAR to engage in activity involving Libya. If a license is required pursuant to another section of the EAR, and the transaction also involves activity within the scope of § 764.2(e) of this part related to an installed base item in Libya, this information should be specified on the license application. Such applications must also include all known information as to how the installed base item originally arrived in Libya. If granted, the license for the proposed transaction will also authorize the related activity within the scope of § 764.2(e) of this part.

> [70 FR 14391, Mar. 22, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 51719, Aug. 31, 2006; 73 FR 49331, Aug. 21, 2008]

      § 764.8   Voluntary self-disclosures for boycott violations.

#### § § 764.8

      This section sets forth procedures for disclosing violations of part 760 of the EAR—Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts and violations of part 762—Recordkeeping—with respect to records related to part 760. In this section, these provisions are referred to collectively as the “antiboycott provisions.” This section also describes BIS's policy regarding such disclosures.

      (a)  BIS strongly encourages disclosure to the Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC) if you believe that you may have violated the antiboycott provisions. Voluntary self-disclosures are a mitigating factor with respect to any enforcement action that OAC might take.

      (b)  (1) This section does not apply to disclosures of violations relating to provisions of the EAR other than the antiboycott provisions. Section 764.5 of this part describes how to prepare disclosures of violations of the EAR other than the antiboycott provisions.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to OAC for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under parts 764 and 766 of the EAR for violations of the antiboycott provisions.

      (3)  The provisions of this section apply only if OAC receives the voluntary self-disclosure as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section before it commences an investigation or inquiry in connection with the same or substantially similar information it received from another source.

      (i)  For purposes of this section, OAC's receipt of a report required to be filed under § 760.5 of the EAR that discloses that a person took an action prohibited by part 760 of the EAR constitutes the receipt of information from another source.

      (ii)  For purposes of this section, a violation that is revealed to OAC by a person who is seeking advice, either by telephone or e-mail, about the antiboycott provisions does not constitute the receipt of information from another source. Such revelation also does not constitute a voluntary self-disclosure or initial notification of a voluntary self-disclosure for purposes of this section.

      (4) Although a voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by BIS, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of BIS, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, BIS would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the decision as to how to consider that factor is within the discretion of the Department of Justice.

      (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management or of a person with authority to make such disclosures on behalf of the firm.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.

      (c) —(1)  Any person wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify OAC as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all transactions where violations of the antiboycott provisions are suspected.

      (2)  The initial notification must be in writing and be sent to the address in § 764.8(c)(7) of this part. The notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. The notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. If the person making the disclosure subsequently completes the narrative account required by § 764.8(c)(3) of this part, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial notification for purposes of § 764.8(b)(3) of this part.

      (3)  After the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of all business transactions where possible antiboycott provision violations are suspected. OAC recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive the same mitigation as the violations voluntarily self-disclosed under this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the EAR or other provision of law enforced by BIS requires disclosure. Upon completion of the review, OAC should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The narrative account should include:

      (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, the furnishing of a certificate indicating that the goods supplied did not originate in a boycotted country;

      (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred, including a description of activities surrounding the violations (e.g., contract negotiations, sale of goods, implementation of letter of credit, bid solicitation);

      (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations; and

      (iv) A description of any mitigating factors.

      (4) Supporting documentation.

      (i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including:

      (A) Copies of boycott certifications and declarations relating to the violation, or copies of documents containing prohibited language or prohibited requests for information;

      (B) Other documents relating to the violation, such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, negotiations, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, bid requests, letters of credit and brochures;

      (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the latest of the following: the documents are supplied to OAC; BIS informs the disclosing party that it will take no action; BIS issues a warning letter for the violation; BIS issues an order that constitutes the final agency action in the matter and all avenues for appeal are exhausted; or the documents are no longer required to be kept under part 762 of the EAR.

      (5)  A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of this part relating to false or misleading representations applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section.

      (6)  OAC believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure.

      (7)  The information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure should be submitted to: Office of Antiboycott Compliance, 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room 6098, Washington, DC 20230, tel: (202) 482-2381, facsimile: (202) 482-0913.

      (d)  After OAC has been provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, BIS may take any of the following actions:

      (1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action;

      (2) Issue a warning letter;

      (3) Issue a proposed charging letter and attempt to settle the matter pursuant to § 766.18 of the EAR;

      (4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to § 766.3 of the EAR if a settlement is not reached or BIS otherwise deems appropriate; and/or

      (5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.

      (e)  Supplement no. 2 to part 766 of the EAR describes how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an antiboycott administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case.

      § 766.1   Scope.

#### § § 766.1

      In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the procedures for imposing administrative sanctions for violations of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. Parts 760 and 764 of the EAR specify those actions that constitute violations, and part 764 describes the sanctions that apply. In addition to describing the procedures for imposing sanctions, this part describes the procedures for imposing temporary denial orders to prevent imminent violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. This part also describes the procedures for taking the discretionary protective administrative action of denying the export privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating any of the statutes, including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing in this part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other administrative or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR, including the exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the EAA. This part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any requirements based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings charging violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in this part.

      § 766.2   Definitions.

      § 766.3   Institution of administrative enforcement proceedings.

#### § § 766.3

      (a)  The Director of the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) or the Director of the Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC), as appropriate, or such other Department of Commerce official as may be designated by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, may begin administrative enforcement proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter in the name of BIS. Supplements nos. 1 and 2 to this part describe how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding the issuance of charging letters. The charging letter shall constitute the formal complaint and will state that there is reason to believe that a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred. It will set forth the essential facts about the alleged violation, refer to the specific regulatory or other provisions involved, and give notice of the sanctions available under part 764 of the EAR. The charging letter will inform the respondent that failure to answer the charges as provided in § 766.6 of this part will be treated as a default under § 766.7 of this part, that the respondent is entitled to a hearing if a written demand for one is requested with the answer, and that the respondent may be represented by counsel, or by other authorized representative who has a power of attorney to represent the respondent. A copy of the charging letter shall be filed with the administrative law judge, which filing shall toll the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Charging letters may be amended or supplemented at any time before an answer is filed, or, with permission of the administrative law judge, afterwards. BIS may unilaterally withdraw charging letters at any time, by notifying the respondent and the administrative law judge.

      (b)  A respondent shall be notified of the issuance of a charging letter, or any amendment or supplement thereto:

      (1) By sending a copy by registered or certified mail or by express mail or commercial courier or delivery service addressed to the respondent at the respondent's last known address;

      (2) By leaving a copy with the respondent or with an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process for the respondent; or

      (3) By leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the respondent's last known dwelling.

      (4) Delivery of a copy of the charging letter, if made in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left. The certificate of service shall be filed with the administrative law judge.

      (c) The date of service of notice of the issuance of a charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or service of notice of the issuance of a supplement or amendment to a charging letter, is the date of its delivery, or of its attempted delivery, by any means described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      § 766.4   Representation.

#### § § 766.4

      A respondent individual may appear and participate in person, a corporation by a duly authorized officer or employee, and a partnership by a partner. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides if not the United States.

      § 766.5   Filing and service of papers other than charging letter.

#### § § 766.5

      (a)  All papers to be filed shall be addressed to EAR Administrative Enforcement Proceedings, U.S. Coast Guard, ALJ Docketing Center, 40 S. Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202-4022, or such other place as the administrative law judge may designate. Filing by United States mail, first class postage prepaid, by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, or by hand delivery, is acceptable. Filing by mail from a foreign country shall be by airmail. In addition, the administrative law judge may authorize filing of papers by facsimile or other electronic means, provided that a hard copy of any such paper is subsequently filed. A copy of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on each party.

      (b)  Service shall be made by personal delivery or by mailing one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service by delivery service or facsimile, in the manner set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, is acceptable. Service on BIS shall be addressed to the Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, Room H-3839, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on a respondent shall be to the address to which the charging letter was sent or to such other address as respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other representative, service on counsel or other representative shall constitute service on that party.

      (c)  The date of filing or service is the day when the papers are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery service, or by facsimile.

      (d)  A certificate of service signed by the party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall accompany every paper, other than the charging letter, filed and served on parties.

      (e)  In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part or by order of the administrative law judge or the Under Secretary, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less.

> [61 FR 12907, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 45633, July 10, 2002; 70 FR 8250, Feb. 18, 2005]

      § 766.6   Answer and demand for hearing.

#### § § 766.6

      (a)  The respondent must answer the charging letter within 30 days after being served with notice of the issuance of a charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or within 30 days of notice of any supplement or amendment to a charging letter, unless time is extended under § 766.16 of this part.

      (b)  The answer must be responsive to the charging letter and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's defense or defenses. The answer must admit or deny specifically each separate allegation of the charging letter; if the respondent is without knowledge, the answer must so state and will operate as a denial. Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed an admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any additional or new matter the respondent believes supports a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon may be refused, except for good cause shown.

      (c)  If the respondent desires a hearing, a written demand for one must be submitted with the answer. Any demand by BIS for a hearing must be filed with the administrative law judge within 30 days after service of the answer. Failure to make a timely written demand for a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the party's right to a hearing, except for good cause shown. If no party demands a hearing, the matter will go forward in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 766.15 of this part.

      (d)  The answer, all other papers, and all documentary evidence must be submitted in English, or translations into English must be filed and served at the same time.

      § 766.7   Default.

#### § § 766.7

      (a)  Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations in the charging letter. In such event, the administrative law judge, on BIS's motion and without further notice to the respondent, shall find the facts to be as alleged in the charging letter and render an initial or recommended decision containing findings of fact and appropriate conclusions of law and issue or recommend an order imposing appropriate sanctions. The decision and order shall be subject to review by the Under Secretary in accordance with the applicable procedures set forth in § 766.21 or § 766.22 of this part.

      (b) —(1)  Upon petition filed by a respondent against whom a default order has been issued, which petition is accompanied by an answer meeting the requirements of § 766.6(b) of this part, the Under Secretary may, after giving all parties an opportunity to comment, and for good cause shown, set aside the default and vacate the order entered thereon and remand the matter to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.

      (2)  A petition under this section must be made within one year of the date of entry of the order which the petition seeks to have vacated.

      § 766.8   Summary decision.

#### § § 766.8

      At any time after a proceeding has been initiated, a party may move for a summary decision disposing of some or all of the issues. The administrative law judge may render an initial or recommended decision and issue or recommend an order if the entire record shows, as to the issue(s) under consideration:

      (a) That there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and

      (b) That the moving party is entitled to a summary decision as a matter of law.

      § 766.9   Discovery.

#### § § 766.9

      (a)  The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the administrative law judge or by waiver or agreement of the parties. The administrative law judge may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for protecting the confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive information.

      (b)  A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party concerned may apply to the administrative law judge for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall be made at least 20 days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties, and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the administrative law judge. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 days after service, or within such additional time as the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.

      (c)  Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.

      (d)  The administrative law judge may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as the judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The judge may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In addition, enforcement by a district court of the United States may be sought under section 12(a) of the EAA.

      § 766.10   Subpoenas.

#### § § 766.10

      (a)  Upon the application of any party, supported by a satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the evidence would not otherwise be available, the administrative law judge will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the judge deems relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope.

      (b)  Subpoenas issued by the administrative law judge may be served in any of the methods set forth in § 766.5(b) of this part.

      (c)  Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.

      § 766.11   Matter protected against disclosure.

#### § § 766.11

      (a)  It is often necessary for BIS to receive and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected against disclosure. Accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or other orders as in the judge's judgment may be consistent with the objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or information. Where the administrative law judge determines that documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BIS to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.

      (b)  If the administrative law judge determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section 12(c) of the EAA, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.

      § 766.12   Prehearing conference.

#### § § 766.12

      (a) The administrative law judge, on the judge's own motion or on request of a party, may direct the parties to participate in a prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:

      (1) Simplification of issues;

      (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;

      (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; or

      (4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings.

      (b) The administrative law judge may order the conference proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, transcribed and filed with the judge.

      (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the administrative law judge may direct the parties to correspond with the judge to achieve the purposes of such a conference.

      (d) The administrative law judge will prepare a summary of any actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary will include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.

      § 766.13   Hearings.

#### § § 766.13

      (a)  The administrative law judge, by agreement with the parties or upon notice to all parties of not less than 30 days, will schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, D.C., unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that another location would better serve the interests of justice.

      (b)  Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit attendance at any hearing or portion thereof to the parties, their representatives and witnesses if the judge deems this necessary or advisable in order to protect sensitive matter (see § 766.11 of this part) from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the administrative law judge to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate weight.

      (c)  Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation. A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, transcribed and filed with the administrative law judge. A respondent may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy by paying any applicable costs. Upon such terms as the administrative law judge deems just, the judge may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by deposition and may admit an affidavit or declaration as evidence, provided that any affidavits or declarations have been filed and served on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be subject to cross-examination.

      (d)  If a party fails to appear in person or by counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed, and that party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceedings or action taken thereafter.

      § 766.14   Interlocutory review of rulings.

#### § § 766.14

      (a) At the request of a party, or on the judge's own initiative, the administrative law judge may certify to the Under Secretary for review a ruling that does not finally dispose of a proceeding, if the administrative law judge determines that immediate review may hasten or facilitate the final disposition of the matter.

      (b) Upon certification to the Under Secretary of the interlocutory ruling for review, the parties will have 10 days to file and serve briefs stating their positions, and five days to file and serve replies, following which the Under Secretary will decide the matter promptly.

      § 766.15   Proceeding without a hearing.

#### § § 766.15

      If the parties have waived a hearing, the case will be decided on the record by the administrative law judge. Proceeding without a hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their charges or defenses. Affidavits or declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories and stipulations may supplement other documentary evidence in the record. The administrative law judge will give each party reasonable opportunity to file rebuttal evidence.

      § 766.16   Procedural stipulations; extension of time.

#### § § 766.16

      (a)  Unless otherwise ordered, a written stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the administrative law judge will modify any procedures established by this part.

      (b)  (1) The parties may extend any applicable time limitation, by stipulation filed with the administrative law judge before the time limitation expires.

      (2) The administrative law judge may, on the judge's own initiative or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration of any applicable time limitation, extend the time within which to file and serve an answer to a charging letter or do any other act required by this part.

      § 766.17   Decision of the administrative law judge.

#### § § 766.17

      (a)  Except for default proceedings under § 766.7 of this part, the administrative law judge will give the parties reasonable opportunity to submit the following, which will be made a part of the record:

      (1) Exceptions to any ruling by the judge or to the admissibility of evidence proffered at the hearing;

      (2) Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;

      (3) Supporting legal arguments for the exceptions and proposed findings and conclusions submitted; and

      (4) A proposed order.

      (b)  After considering the entire record in the proceeding, the administrative law judge will issue a written decision.

      (1)  For proceedings charging violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be an initial decision. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and findings as to whether there has been a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. If the administrative law judge finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with respect to one or more charges, the judge shall order dismissal of the charges in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the administrative law judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge may issue an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided in part 764 of the EAR. The decision and order shall be served on each party, and shall become effective as the final decision of the Department 30 days after service, unless an appeal is filed in accordance with § 766.21 of this part.

      (2)  For proceedings not involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be a recommended decision. The decision will include recommended findings of fact, conclusions of law, and findings as to whether there has been a violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. If the administrative law judge finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a recommended finding that a violation has occurred with respect to one or more charges, the judge shall recommend dismissal of any such charge. If the administrative law judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge shall recommend an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided in part 764 of the EAR, or such other action as the judge deems appropriate. The administrative law judge shall immediately certify the record, including the original copy of the recommended decision and order, to the Under Secretary for review in accordance with § 766.22 of this part. The administrative law judge shall also immediately serve the recommended decision on all parties. Because of the time limits established in the EAA for review by the Under Secretary, service upon parties shall be by personal delivery, express mail or other overnight carrier.

      (c)  Any order imposing administrative sanctions may provide for the suspension of the sanction imposed, in whole or in part and on such terms of probation or other conditions as the administrative law judge or the Under Secretary may specify. Any suspension order may be modified or revoked by the signing official upon application of BIS showing a violation of the probationary terms or other conditions, after service on the respondent of notice of the application in accordance with the service provisions of § 766.3 of this part, and with such opportunity for response as the responsible signing official in his/her discretion may allow. A copy of any order modifying or revoking the suspension shall also be served on the respondent in accordance with the provisions of § 766.3 of this part.

      (d)  Administrative enforcement proceedings not involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR shall be concluded, including review by the Under Secretary under § 766.22 of this part, within one year of the submission of a charging letter, unless the administrative law judge, for good cause shown, extends such period. The charging letter will be deemed to have been submitted to the administrative law judge on the date the respondent files an answer or on the date BIS files a motion for a default order pursuant to § 766.7(a) of this part, whichever occurs first.

      § 766.18   Settlement.

#### § § 766.18

      (a)  In cases in which settlement is reached before service of a charging letter, a proposed charging letter will be prepared, and a settlement proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal had been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the administrative law judge.

      (b)  (1) If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the judge shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time, usually not to exceed 30 days, upon notification by the parties that they have entered into good faith settlement negotiations. The administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, grant additional stays. If settlement is reached, a proposal will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and notify the administrative law judge that the case is withdrawn from adjudication. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed to adjudication by the administrative law judge as though no settlement proposal had been made.

      (2) If the case is pending before the Under Secretary under § 766.21 or § 766.22 of this part, the parties may submit a settlement proposal to the Under Secretary for approval and signature. If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the proposal, the case will proceed to final decision in accordance with § 766.21 or § 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.

      (c) Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 766.17(c) of this part.

      (d) Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this part. This reflects the fact that BIS has neither the authority nor the responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.

      (e) Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed.

      (f) Supplements nos. 1 and 2 to this part describe how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding the terms under which it is willing to settle particular cases.

      § 766.19   Reopening.

#### § § 766.19

      The respondent may petition the administrative law judge within one year of the date of the final decision, except where the decision arises from a default judgment or from a settlement, to reopen an administrative enforcement proceeding to receive any relevant and material evidence which was unknown or unobtainable at the time the proceeding was held. The petition must include a summary of such evidence, the reasons why it is deemed relevant and material, and the reasons why it could not have been presented at the time the proceedings were held. The administrative law judge will grant or deny the petition after providing other parties reasonable opportunity to comment. If the proceeding is reopened, the administrative law judge may make such arrangements as the judge deems appropriate for receiving the new evidence and completing the record. The administrative law judge will then issue a new initial or recommended decision and order, and the case will proceed to final decision and order in accordance with § 766.21 or § 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.

      § 766.20   Record for decision and availability of documents.

#### § § 766.20

      (a)  The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders, all papers and requests filed in the proceedings and, for purposes of any appeal under § 766.21 of this part or review under § 766.22 of this part, the decision of the administrative law judge and such submissions as are provided for by §§ 766.21 and 766.22 of this part, will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision. When a case is settled after the service of a charging letter, the record will consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the settlement agreement and the order. When a case is settled before service of a charging letter, the record will consist of the proposed charging letter, the settlement agreement and the order.

      (b)  On the judge's own motion, or on the motion of any party, the administrative law judge may direct that there be a restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to restrict access to any portion of the record is responsible for submitting, at the time specified in § 766.20(c)(2) of this part, a version of the document proposed for public availability that reflects the requested deletion. The restricted access portion of the record will be placed in a separate file and the file will be clearly marked to avoid improper disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the official record in the proceedings. The administrative law judge may act at any time to permit material that becomes declassified or unrestricted through passage of time to be transferred to the unrestricted access portion of the record.

      (c) —(1)  (i) For proceedings started on or after October 12, 1979, all charging letters, answers, initial and recommended decisions, and orders disposing of a case will be made available for public inspection in the BIS Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-6624, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be made available on request. In addition, all decisions of the Under Secretary on appeal pursuant to § 766.22 of this part and those final orders providing for denial, suspension or revocation of export privileges shall be published in the

      (ii) For proceedings started before October 12, 1979, the public availability of the record for decision will be governed by the applicable regulations in effect when the proceedings were begun.

      (2) —(i)  For matters relating to part 760 of the EAR, documents are available immediately upon filing, except for any portion of the record for which a request for segregation is made. Parties that seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under paragraph (b) of this section must make such a request, together with the reasons supporting the claim of confidentiality, simultaneously with the submission of material for the record.

      (ii)  In all other cases, documents other than charging letters filed on or after June 2, 2022, will be available only after the final administrative disposition of the case. In these cases, parties desiring to restrict access to any portion of the record under paragraph (b) of this section must assert their claim of confidentiality, together with the reasons for supporting the claim, before the close of the proceeding.

      § 766.21   Appeals.

#### § § 766.21

      (a)  For proceedings charging violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, a party may appeal to the Under Secretary from an order disposing of a proceeding or an order denying a petition to set aside a default or a petition for reopening, on the grounds:

      (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or unsupported by substantial evidence of record;

      (2) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to law;

      (3) That prejudicial procedural error occurred, or

      (4) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify the grounds on which the appeal is based and the provisions of the order from which the appeal is taken.

      (b)  An appeal from an order must be filed with the Office of the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3898, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230, within 30 days after service of the order appealed from. If the Under Secretary cannot act on an appeal for any reason, the Under Secretary will designate another Department of Commerce official to receive and act on the appeal.

      (c)  The filing of an appeal shall not stay the operation of any order, unless the order by its express terms so provides or unless the Under Secretary, upon application by a party and with opportunity for response, grants a stay.

      (d)  The Under Secretary normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals. A full written statement in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal and be simultaneously served on all parties, who shall have 30 days from service to file a reply. At his/her discretion, the Under Secretary may accept new submissions, but will not ordinarily accept those submissions filed more than 30 days after the filing of the reply to the appellant's first submission.

      (e)  The decision will be in writing and will be accompanied by an order signed by the Under Secretary giving effect to the decision. The order may either dispose of the case by affirming, modifying or reversing the order of the administrative law judge or may refer the case back to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.

      § 766.22   Review by Under Secretary.

#### § § 766.22

      (a)  For proceedings not involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, the administrative law judge shall immediately refer the recommended decision and order to the Under Secretary. Because of the time limits provided under the EAA for review by the Under Secretary, service of the recommended decision and order on the parties, all papers filed by the parties in response, and the final decision of the Under Secretary must be by personal delivery, facsimile, express mail or other overnight carrier. If the Under Secretary cannot act on a recommended decision and order for any reason, the Under Secretary will designate another Department of Commerce official to receive and act on the recommendation.

      (b)  Parties shall have 12 days from the date of issuance of the recommended decision and order in which to submit simultaneous responses. Parties thereafter shall have eight days from receipt of any response(s) in which to submit replies. Any response or reply must be received within the time specified by the Under Secretary.

      (c)  Within 30 days after receipt of the recommended decision and order, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision and order of the administrative law judge. If he/she vacates the recommended decision and order, the Under Secretary may refer the case back to the administrative law judge for further proceedings. Because of the time limits, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of any hearing, and any submissions by the parties concerning the recommended decision.

      (d)  The final decision and implementing order shall be served on the parties and will be publicly available in accordance with § 766.20 of this part.

      § 766.23   Related persons.

#### § § 766.23

      (a)  In order to prevent evasion, certain types of orders under this part may be made applicable not only to the respondent, but also to other persons then or thereafter related to the respondent by ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other connection in the conduct of trade or business. Orders that may be made applicable to related persons include those that deny or affect export privileges, including temporary denial orders, and those that exclude a respondent from practice before BIS.

      (b)  If BIS has reason to believe that a person is related to the respondent and that an order that is being sought or that has been issued should be made applicable to that person in order to prevent evasion of the order, BIS shall, except in an  proceeding under § 766.24(a) of this part, give that person notice in accordance with § 766.5(b) of this part and an opportunity to oppose such action. If the official authorized to issue the order against the respondent finds that the order should be made applicable to that person in order to prevent evasion of the order that official shall issue or amend the order accordingly.

      (c)  Any person named by BIS in an order as related to the respondent may appeal that action. The sole issues to be raised and ruled on in any such appeal are whether the person so named is related to the respondent and whether the order is justified in order to prevent evasion.

      (1) A person named as related to the respondent in an order issued pursuant to § 766.25 may file an appeal with the Under Secretary for Industry and Security pursuant to part 756 of the EAR.

      (2) A person named as related to the respondent in an order issued pursuant to other provisions of this part may file an appeal with the administrative law judge.

      (i) If the order made applicable to the related person is for a violation related to part 760 of the EAR, the related person may file an appeal with the administrative law judge. The related person may appeal the initial decision and order of the administrative law judge to the Under Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 766.21.

      (ii) If the order made applicable to the related person is issued pursuant to § 766.24 of this part to prevent an imminent violation, the recommended decision and order of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the Under Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 766.24(e) of this part.

      (iii) If the order made applicable to the related person is for a violation of the EAR not related to part 760 of the EAR and not issued pursuant to § 766.24 of this part, the recommended decision and order of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the Under Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 766.22 of this part.

> [61 FR 12907, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 27605, May 12, 2006]

      § 766.24   Temporary denials.

#### § § 766.24

      (a)  The procedures in this section apply to temporary denial orders issued on or after July 12, 1985. For temporary denial orders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will be governed by the applicable regulations in effect at the time the temporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other action BIS may take under the EAR with respect to any application, order, license or authorization issued under ECRA, BIS may ask the Assistant Secretary to issue a temporary denial order on an  basis to prevent an imminent violation, as defined in this section, of the ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. The temporary denial order will deny export privileges to any person named in the order as provided for in § 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.

      (b)  (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order temporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privileges described in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BIS that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.

      (2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation and state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denial orders are public, the description of the imminent violation and the reasons for proceeding on an  basis set forth therein shall be stated in a manner that is consistent with national security, foreign policy, business confidentiality, and investigative concerns.

      (3) A violation may be “imminent” either in time or in degree of likelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BIS may show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the general circumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminal or administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of future violations. To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BIS may show that the violation under investigation or charges is significant, deliberate, covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technical or negligent, and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies in the United States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-origin items in order to reduce the likelihood that a person under investigation or charges continues to export or acquire abroad such items, risking subsequent disposition contrary to export control requirements. Lack of information establishing the precise time a violation may occur does not preclude a finding that a violation is imminent, so long as there is sufficient reason to believe the likelihood of a violation.

      (4) The temporary denial order will be issued for a period not exceeding 180 days.

      (5) Notice of the issuance of a temporary denial order on an  basis shall be given in accordance with § 766.5(b) of this part upon issuance.

      (c)  A temporary denial order may be made applicable to related persons in accordance with § 766.23 of this part.

      (d)  (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expiration date of a temporary denial order, BIS believes that renewal of the denial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation, BIS may file a written request setting forth the basis for its belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, asking that the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, with modifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period not exceeding 180 days. In cases demonstrating a pattern of repeated, ongoing and/or continuous apparent violations, BIS may request the renewal of a temporary denial order for an additional period not exceeding one year. BIS's request shall be delivered to the respondent, or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance with § 766.5(b) of this part unless exceptional circumstances exist, which will constitute notice of the renewal application.

      (2)  To facilitate timely notice of renewal requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States may designate a local agent for this purpose and provide written notification of such designation to BIS in the manner set forth in § 766.5(b) of this part.

      (3)  (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporary denial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a written submission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not later than seven days before the expiration date of such order. For good cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions received not later than five days before the expiration date. The Assistant Secretary ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good cause shown in respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to take limited discovery, consisting of a request for production of documents. If requested by the respondent in the written submission, the Assistant Secretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The hearing shall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oral argument. The only issue to be considered on BIS's request for renewal is whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent an imminent violation as defined herein.

      (ii) Any person designated as a related person may not oppose the issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file an appeal in accordance with § 766.23(c) of this part.

      (iii) If no written opposition to BIS's renewal request is received within the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the order renewing the temporary denial order without a hearing.

      (4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once.

      (e) —(1)  (i) A respondent may, at any time, file an appeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with the administrative law judge.

      (ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectiveness of the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor will it operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of any renewal application.

      (2)  A respondent may appeal on the grounds that the finding that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation is unsupported.

      (3)  A full written statement in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriate evidence, and be simultaneously served on BIS, which shall have seven days from receipt to file a reply. Service on the administrative law judge shall be addressed to U.S. Coast Guard, ALJ Docketing Center, 40 S. Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202-4022. Service on BIS shall be as set forth in § 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judge normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals.

      (4)  Within 10 working days after an appeal is filed, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision to the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommending whether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial order should be affirmed, modified or vacated.

      (5)  Within five working days after receipt of the recommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order accepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because of the time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of any hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order shall be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporary denial order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or other authorization issued under ECRA.

      (f)  A copy of any temporary denial order issued or renewed and any final decision on appeal shall be published in the  and shall be delivered to BIS and to the respondent, or any agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person in the same manner as provided in § 766.5 of this part for filing for papers other than a charging letter.

      § 766.25   Administrative action denying export privileges.

#### § § 766.25

      (a)  The Director of the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE), in consultation with the Director of the Office of Exporter Services, may deny the export privileges of any person who has been convicted of a violation of any of the statutes set forth at 50 U.S.C. 4819(e)(1)(B), including any regulation, license, or order issued pursuant to such statutes.

      (b)  Upon notification that a person has been convicted of a violation of one or more of the provisions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director of OEE, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Exporter Services, will determine whether to deny such person export privileges, including but not limited to applying for, obtaining, or using any license, License Exception, or export control document; or participating in or benefitting in any way from any export or export-related transaction subject to the EAR. Before taking action to deny a person export privileges under this section, the Director of OEE will provide the person written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to comment through a written submission, unless exceptional circumstances exist. In reviewing the response, the Director of OEE will consider any relevant or mitigating evidence why these privileges should not be denied. Upon final determination, the Director of OEE will notify by letter each person denied export privileges under this section.

      (c)  In determining whether and for how long to deny U.S. export privileges to a person previously convicted of one or more of the statutes set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director of OEE may take into consideration any relevant information, including, but not limited to, the seriousness of the offense involved in the criminal prosecution, the nature and duration of the criminal sanctions imposed, and whether the person has undertaken any corrective measures.

      (d)  Any denial of export privileges under this section shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the conviction of the person who is subject to the denial.

      (e)  Any person denied export privileges under this section will be considered a “person denied export privileges” for purposes of § 736.2(b)(4) (General Prohibition 4—Engage in actions prohibited by a denial order) and § 764.2(k) of the EAR.

      (f)  The orders denying export privileges under this section are published in the  when issued, and, for the convenience of the public, information about those orders may be included in compilations maintained by BIS on a Web site and as a supplement to the unofficial edition of the EAR available by subscription from the Government Printing Office.

      (g)  An appeal of an action under this section will be pursuant to part 756 of the EAR.

      (h)  The Director of OEE, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Exporter Services, may take action in accordance with § 766.23 of this part to make applicable to related persons an order that is being sought or that has been issued under this section.

    PART 768—FOREIGN AVAILABILITY DETERMINATION PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA

### Part 768

**Authority:** Authority: 50 U.S.C. 4601  50 U.S.C. 1701  E.O. 13222, 66 FR 44025, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783; Notice of August 15, 2017, 82 FR 39005 (August 16, 2017).

**Source:** Source: 61 FR 12915, Mar. 25, 1996, unless otherwise noted.

      § 768.1   Introduction.

#### § § 768.1

      In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.

      (a)  Pursuant to sections 5(f) and 5(h) of the Export Administration Act (EAA), the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration directs the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in gathering and analyzing all the evidence necessary for the Secretary to determine foreign availability.

      (b)  This part applies only to the extent that items are controlled for national security purposes. This part does not apply to encryption items that were formerly controlled on the U.S. Munitions List and that were transferred to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date, which shall not be subject to any mandatory foreign availability review procedures.

      (c)  There are two general programs of foreign availability:

      (1)  In this category are denied license assessments (see §§ 768.4(b) and 768.7 of this part) and decontrol assessments (see §§ 768.4(c) and 768.7 of this part).

      (2)  In this category are denied license assessments, decontrol assessments, and evaluations of eligibility for expedited licensing (see § 768.8 of this part).

      (d)  The following are definitions of terms used in this part 768:

      See foreign availability submission.

      An evidentiary analysis that BIS conducts concerning the foreign availability of a given item based on the assessment criteria, data gathered by BIS, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC committees, and industry.

      Statutorily established criteria that must be assessed for the Secretary to make a determination with respect to foreign availability. They are, available-in-fact, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantity so as to render the control ineffective, and of comparable quality. (See § 768.6 of this part).

      An item is available-in-fact to a country if it is produced within the country or if it may be obtained by that country from a third country. Ordinarily, items will not be considered available-in-fact to non-controlled countries if the items are available only under a validated national security license or a comparable authorization from a country that maintains export controls on such items cooperatively with the United States.

      Any party who makes a foreign availability submission, excluding TACs.

      An item is of comparable quality to an item controlled under the EAR if it possesses the characteristics specified in the Commerce Control List (CCL) for that item and is alike in key characteristics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purpose for which the control was placed on the item.

      Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.

      Removal of license requirements under the EAR.

      An assessment of the foreign availability of an item to a country or countries for purposes of determining whether decontrol is warranted. Such assessments may be conducted after BIS receives a foreign availability submission or a TAC certification, or by the Secretary's own initiative.

      A foreign availability assessment conducted as a result of a claimant's allegation of foreign availability for an item (or items) that BIS has denied or has issued a letter of intent to deny a license. If the Secretary determines that foreign availability exists, BIS's approval of a license will be limited to the items, countries, and quantities in the allegation.

      The Secretary's decision that foreign availability within the meaning of the EAA does or does not exist. (See § 768.7 of this part).

      An evaluation that BIS initiates for the purpose of determining whether an item is eligible for the expedited licensing procedure. (See § 768.8 of this part).

      Under expedited licensing procedures, BIS reviews and processes a license application for the export of an eligible item to a non-controlled country within statutory time limits. Licenses are deemed approved unless BIS denies within the statutory time limits (See § 768.8 of this part).

      An allegation of foreign availability a claimant makes, supported by reasonable evidence, and submits to BIS. (See § 768.5 of this part).

      Any commodity, software, or technology.

      The items described in supplement no. 2 to this part 768 are eligible for the expedited license procedures (See § 768.8 of this part).

      A Presidential decision to maintain export controls on an item notwithstanding its foreign availability as determined under the EAA. The President's decision is based on his/her determination that the absence of the controls would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Once the President makes such a decision, the President must actively pursue negotiations to eliminate foreign availability with the governments of the sources of foreign availability. (See § 768.7 of this part).

      Any country not defined as a controlled country by this section.

      A person located outside the jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in part 772 of the EAR).

      Relevant information that is credible.

      Relevant information that is credible and dependable.

      As used in this part, the Secretary refers to the Secretary of Commerce or his/her designee.

      An item is of similar quality to an item that is controlled under the EAR if it is substantially alike in key characteristics that may include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purpose for which the control was placed on the item.

      The amount of an item that would render the U.S. export control, or the denial of the license in question, ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, it is the quantity that meets the military needs of that country so that U.S. exports of the item to that country would not make a significant contribution to its military potential.

      A Committee created under section 5(h) of the EAA that advises and assists the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency, or official of the Government of the United States to which the President delegates authority under the EAA on export control matters related to specific areas of controlled items.

      A statement that a TAC submits to BIS, supported by reasonable evidence, documented as in a FAS, that foreign availability to a controlled country exists for an item that falls within the TAC's area of technical expertise.

      § 768.2   Foreign availability described.

#### § § 768.2

      (a)  Foreign availability exists when the Secretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an item subject to U.S. national security export controls, and is available-in-fact to a country, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantities to render the U.S. export control of that item or the denial of a license ineffective. For a controlled country, such control or denial is “ineffective” when maintaining such control or denying a specific license would not restrict the availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of the controlled country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security of the United States (see sections 5(a) and 3(2)(A) of the EAA.)

      (b)  There are two types of foreign availability:

      (1) Foreign availability to a controlled country; and

      (2) Foreign availability to a non-controlled country.

      § 768.3   Foreign availability assessment.

#### § § 768.3

      (a)  A foreign availability assessment is an evidentiary analysis that BIS conducts to assess the foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by BIS, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC committees, and industry. BIS uses the results of the analysis in formulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign availability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines that foreign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for national security reasons or approve the license in question if there is no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the President exercises a National Security Override (see § 768.7 of this part). The effect of any such determination on the effectiveness of foreign policy controls may be considered independent of this part.

      (b)  There are two types of foreign availability assessments:

      (1) Denied license assessment; and

      (2) Decontrol assessment.

      (c)  See § 768.8 of this part for the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing procedures.

      § 768.4   Initiation of an assessment.

#### § § 768.4

      (a)  To initiate an assessment, each claimant or TAC must submit a FAS or a TAC Certification to BIS. TACs are authorized to certify foreign availability only to controlled countries. Claimants can allege foreign availability for either controlled or non-controlled countries.

      (b)  A claimant whose license application BIS has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to deny on national security grounds, may request that BIS initiate a denied license assessment by submitting a Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) within 90 days after denial of the license. As part of its submission, the claimant must request that the specified license application be approved on the grounds of foreign availability. The evidence must relate to the particular export as described on the license application and to the alleged comparable item. If foreign availability is found, the Secretary will approve the license for the specific items, countries, and quantities listed on the application. The denied license assessment procedure, however, is not intended to result in the removal of the U.S. export control on an item by incrementally providing a country with amounts that, taken together, would constitute a sufficient quantity of an item. The Secretary will not approve on foreign availability grounds a denied license if the approval of such license would itself render the U.S. export control ineffective in achieving its purpose. In the case of a positive determination, the Secretary will determine whether a decontrol assessment is warranted. If so, then BIS will initiate a decontrol assessment.

      (c)  (1) Any claimant may at any time request that BIS initiate a decontrol assessment by a FAS to BIS alleging foreign availability to any country or countries.

      (2) A TAC may request that BIS initiate a decontrol assessment at any time by submitting a TAC Certification to BIS that there is foreign availability to a controlled country for items that fall within the area of the TAC's technical expertise.

      (3) The Secretary, on his/her own initiative, may initiate a decontrol assessment.

      (d)  All foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications should be submitted to: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Room H-1093, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230.

      § 768.5   Contents of foreign availability submissions and Technical Advisory Committee certifications.

#### § § 768.5

      (a) All foreign availability submissions must contain, in addition to information on product or technology alleged to be available from foreign sources, at least:

      (1) The name of the claimant;

      (2) The claimant's mailing and business address;

      (3) The claimant's telephone number; and

      (4) A contact point and telephone number.

      (b) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications should contain as much evidence as is available to support the claim, including, but not limited to:

      (1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to be comparable;

      (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S. technology;

      (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis for claiming that the item is a non-U.S. source item;

      (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics of the items on which a qualitative comparison may be made;

      (5) Non-U.S. source's production quantities and/or sales of the alleged comparable items and marketing efforts;

      (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control;

      (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlled parts and components incorporated in the items alleged to be comparable; and

      (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact to the country or countries for which foreign availability is alleged.

      (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but is not limited to, the following:

      (1) Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures, operation or maintenance manuals;

      (2) Articles from reputable trade and technical publications;

      (3) Photographs;

      (4) Depositions based on eyewitness accounts; and

      (5) Other credible evidence.

      (d) Upon receipt of a FAS or TAC certification, BIS will review it to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the belief that foreign availability may exist. If BIS determines the FAS or TAC certification is lacking in supporting evidence, BIS will seek additional evidence from appropriate sources, including the claimant or TAC. BIS will initiate the assessment when it determines that it has sufficient evidence that foreign availability may exist. Claimant and TAC certified assessments will be deemed to be initiated as of the date of such determination.

      (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreign availability assessment criteria described in § 768.6 of this part and the examples of evidence described in supplement no. 1 to part 768 when assembling supporting evidence for inclusion in the FAS or TAC certification.

      § 768.6   Criteria.

#### § § 768.6

      BIS will evaluate the evidence contained in a FAS or TAC certification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment process in accordance with certain criteria that must be met before BIS can recommend a positive determination to the Secretary. The criteria are defined in § 768.1(d) of this part. In order to initiate an assessment, each FAS and TAC certification should address each of these criteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are:

      (a) Available-in-fact;

      (b) Non-U.S. source;

      (c) Sufficient quantity; and

      (d) Comparable quality.

      § 768.7   Procedures.

#### § § 768.7

      (a)  (1) Once BIS accepts a FAS or TAC certification of foreign availability, BIS will notify the claimant or TAC that it is initiating the assessment.

      (2) BIS will publish a  notice of the initiation of any assessment.

      (3) BIS will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their contractors that may have information concerning the item on which BIS has initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, and contractor shall provide BIS all relevant information concerning the item. BIS will invite interested departments and agencies to participate in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of this section).

      (b)  BIS will seek and consider all available information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in § 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BIS initiates the assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries, technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments of Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly sought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations; foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases; scientific and engineering research and development organizations; and international trade fairs.

      (c)  BIS will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether the reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the foreign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommend a determination that foreign availability does or does not exist.

      (d)  (1) Upon completion of each assessment, BIS, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The assessment upon which BIS bases its recommendation will accompany the recommendation to the Secretary.

      (2) BIS will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national security export control, or denial of the license application in question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial is “ineffective” when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security of the United States.

      (3) The Secretary will make the determination of foreign availability on the basis of the BIS assessment and recommendation; the Secretary's determination will take into account the evidence provided to BIS, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State and any other interested agencies, and any other information that the Secretary considers relevant.

      (4) For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section 5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make a determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and will notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positive determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies.

      (5) The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and TAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for claimant-initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section).

      (e)  BIS will notify all appropriate U.S. agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an assessment and will invite their participation in the assessment process. BIS will provide all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their receipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BIS will provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to interested agencies and departments for their review following the Secretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiated and TAC-initiated assessments, BIS will provide all interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.

      (f)  (1) No later than 5 months after the initiation of an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretary will inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in the  a notice that:

      (i) Foreign availability exists, and

      (A) The requirement of a license has been removed or the license application in question has been approved; or

      (B) The President has determined that for national security purposes the export controls must be maintained or the license application must be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being initiated; or

      (C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the former COCOM regime, the U.S. Government will conduct any necessary consultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of the license with the former COCOM regime for a period of up to 4 months from the date of the publication of the determination in the  (the U.S. Government may remove the license requirement for exports to non-controlled countries pending completion of the former COCOM regime review process); or

      (ii) Foreign availability does not exist.

      (2) For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will make a foreign availability determination within 90 days following initiation of the assessment. BIS will prepare and submit a report to the TAC and to the Congress stating that:

      (i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the license requirement; or

      (ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has recommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken to eliminate the foreign availability; or

      (iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability.

      (3) There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated by the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BIS will make every effort to complete such assessments and determinations promptly.

      (g)  When the Secretary determines that an item controlled for national security reasons is available to a controlled country and the President does not issue a National Security Override (NSO), BIS will submit the determination to the Department of State, along with a draft proposal for the multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOM regime approval of the license. The Department of State will submit the proposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The former COCOM regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal.

      (h)  If the Secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled countries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export to all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or approve the license in question, unless the President exercises a National Security Override.

      (i)  (1) The President may determine that an export control must be maintained notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such a determination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is based on the President's decision that the absence of the control would prove detrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (as described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is effective for 6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. Government will actively pursue negotiations with the government of any source country during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability.

      (2) There are two types of National Security Overrides:

      (i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA (claimant and self-initiated assessments); and

      (ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-certification assessments).

      (3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls or deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.

      (4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.

      (5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls.

      (6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, BIS will publish notices in the  consisting of:

      (i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;

      (ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO;

      (iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President's decision; and

      (iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.

      (7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to an additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the President certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be detrimental to the United States national security.

      (8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BIS will retain the control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If foreign availability is not eliminated, BIS will decontrol the item by removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated, BIS will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability.

      (j)  If BIS becomes aware of conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BIS may review the conditions. If BIS finds that the foreign availability previously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier found now does exist, BIS will make a recommendation to the Secretary of Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The Secretary of Commerce will make a determination, and BIS will publish a  notice of the determination.

      § 768.8   Eligibility of expedited licensing procedures for non-controlled countries.

#### § § 768.8

      (a) BIS determines the eligibility of an item for expedited licensing procedures on the basis of an evaluation of the foreign availability of the item. Eligibility is specific to the items and the countries to which they are found to be available.

      (b) BIS will initiate an eligibility evaluation:

      (1) On its own initiative;

      (2) On receipt of a FAS; or

      (3) On receipt of a TAC certification.

      (c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receipt of either a FAS or TAC certification, BIS will notify the claimant or TAC of the receipt and initiation of an evaluation and publish a  notice of the initiation of the evaluation.

      (d) The criteria for determining eligibility for expedited licensing procedures are:

      (1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified

      non-controlled country from a foreign source;

      (2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-controlled item; and

      (3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlled country without effective restrictions.

      (e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary of Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on the basis of the BIS evaluation and recommendation, taking into consideration the evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and other interested agencies provide to BIS and any other information that the Secretary considers relevant.

      (f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification, BIS will publish the Secretary's determination in the  that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensing procedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amend supplement no. 2 to part 768.

      (g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BIS will be notified of the Secretary's determination and, where appropriate, supplement no. 2 to part 768 will be amended.

      (h) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications to initiate an expedited licensing procedure evaluation must be clearly designated on their face as a request for expedited licensing procedure and must specify the items, quantities and countries alleged eligible. Submissions and certifications should be sent to: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Room H-1093, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

      § 768.9   Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations.

#### § § 768.9

      Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according to the standards and procedures described in part 756 of the EAR. A Presidential decision (NSO) to deny a license or continue controls notwithstanding a determination of foreign availability is not subject to appeal.

      § 768.10   Removal of controls on less sophisticated items.

#### § § 768.10

      Where the Secretary has removed national security controls on an item for foreign availability reasons, the Secretary will also remove controls on similar items that are controlled for national security reasons and whose functions, technological approach, performance thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for national security export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of the item that BIS has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons.

    PART 770—INTERPRETATIONS

### Part 770

**Authority:** Authority: 50 U.S.C. 4801-4852; 50 U.S.C. 4601  50 U.S.C. 1701  E.O. 13222, 66 FR 44025, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783.

      § 770.1   Introduction.

#### § § 770.1

      In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part provides commodity, technology, and software interpretations. These interpretations clarify the scope of controls where such scope is not readily apparent from the Commerce Control List (CCL) (see supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) and other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations.

      § 770.2   Item interpretations.

#### § § 770.2

      (a)  (1) Anti-friction bearings or bearing systems shipped as spares or replacements are classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2A001 (ball, roller, or needle-roller bearings and parts). This applies to separate shipments of anti-friction bearings or bearing systems and anti-friction bearings or bearing systems shipped with machinery or equipment for which they are intended to be used as spares or replacement parts.

      (2) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system physically incorporated in a segment of a machine or in a complete machine prior to shipment loses its identity as a bearing. In this scenario, the machine or segment of machinery containing the bearing is the item subject to export control requirements.

      (3) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system not incorporated in a segment of a machine prior to shipment, but shipped as a component of a complete unassembled (knocked-down) machine, is considered a component of a machine. In this scenario, the complete machine is the item subject to export license requirements.

      (b) —(1)  In instances where one or more assembled machines or units of equipment are being exported, the individual component parts that are physically incorporated into the machine or equipment do not require a license. The license or general exception under which the complete machine or unit of equipment is exported will also cover its component parts, provided that the parts are normal and usual components of the machine or equipment being exported, or that the physical incorporation is not used as a device to evade the requirement for a license.

      (2)  In instances where parts are exported as spares, replacements, for resale, or for stock, a license is required only if the appropriate entry for the part specifies that a license is required for the intended destination.

      (c) [Reserved]

      (d)  Control equipment for paging systems (broadcast radio or selectively signalled receiving systems) is defined as circuit switching equipment in Category 5 of the CCL.

      (e) —(1)  “Numerical control” units for machine tools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, are controlled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN 2B001.a. “Numerical control” units include computers with add-on “motion control boards”. A computer with add-on “motion control boards” for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a even when the computer alone without “motion control boards” is not subject to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the “motion control boards” are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b.

      (2)  (i) When preparing a license application for a numerical control system, the machine tool and the control unit are classified separately. If either the machine tool or the control unit requires a license, then the entire unit requires a license. If either a machine tool or a control unit is exported separately from the system, the exported component is classified on the license application without regard to the other parts of a possible system.

      (ii) When preparing the Electronic Export Information (EEI) on the Automated Export System (AES), a system being shipped complete (i.e., machine and control unit), should be reported under the Schedule B number for each machine. When either a control unit or a machine is shipped separately, it should be reported under the Schedule B number appropriate for the individual item being exported.

      (f)  “Parts,” “accessories,” or equipment that are being shipped as scrap should be described on the EEI filing to the AES in sufficient detail to be identified under the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as “parts,” “accessories,” or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged, packed, or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, the Customs Officer may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, orders and correspondence indicating whether the commodities are scrap or are being exported for use as “parts,” “accessories,” or equipment.

      (g)  Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S. Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following, which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce:

      (1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity by means of excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing, cutting, or by any other method are “scrap”.

      (2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armed services as “scrap”, whether or not they have been heated, flame-treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any other method.

      (3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions List are “scrap”, and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling, crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should consult the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.

      (l)  (1) Digital computers or computer systems classified under ECCN 4A003.b or .c, that qualify for “No License Required” (NLR) must be evaluated on the basis of Adjusted Peak Performance (APP) alone, to the exclusion of all other technical parameters. Digital computers or computer systems classified under ECCN 4A003.b or .c that qualify for License Exception APP must be evaluated on the basis of APP, to the exclusion of all other technical parameters. Assemblies performing analog-to-digital conversions are evaluated under Category 3—Electronics, ECCN 3A002.h.

      (2) Related equipment classified under ECCN 4A003.g may be exported or reexported under License Exceptions GBS or CIV. When related equipment is exported or reexported as part of a computer system, NLR or License Exception APP is available for the computer system and the related equipment, as appropriate.

      (m)  Encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5A004 and 5D002 may be pre-loaded on a laptop, handheld device or other computer or equipment and exported under the tools of trade provision of License Exception TMP or the personal use exemption under License Exception BAG, subject to the terms and conditions of such License Exceptions. Neither License Exception TMP nor License Exception BAG contains a reporting requirement. Like other “information security” “software,” components, “electronic assemblies” or modules, the control status of encryption commodities and software is determined in Category 5—Part 2 even if they are bundled, commingled or incorporated in a computer or other equipment. However, commodities and software specially designed for medical end use that incorporate an item in Category 5—Part 2 are not controlled in Category 5—Part 2. See paragraph (a) of supplement no. 3 to part 774 (Statements of Understanding) of the EAR.

      (n)  Forgings, castings, and other unfinished products, such as extrusions and machined bodies, that have reached a stage in manufacturing where they are clearly identifiable by mechanical properties, material composition, geometry, or function as commodities controlled by any Product Group A (“End Items,” “Equipment,” “Accessories,” “Attachments,” “Parts,” “Components” and “Systems”) “600 series” ECCN are controlled in that “600 series” ECCN.

      (o) —(1)  Integrated circuits (ICs), including packaged “electronic assemblies” of ICs described by this section, that are manufactured using existing commercial fabrication process technologies and which are acquired, tested, or otherwise used by, for, or under contract with the United States Government (USG), are not considered to be radiation hardened ( designed to withstand a specified radiation dose or upset) or temperature rated ( rated to operate at prescribed temperatures) as may otherwise be specified under an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR, provided all of the following apply:

      (i) During “development”, the IC is not designed, rated, or certified (except by or for the USG) to meet the radiation or temperature specifications of any ECCN; and

      (ii) All commercial testing (including by the manufacturer during fabrication, sort, packaging or assembly) regarding radiation or temperature is limited to standard commercial tools and techniques, or else by means funded or furnished by the USG for their use in the commercial setting for these specified ICs.

      (2)  The “development”, “production,” or subsequent use of the ICs described by this section does not change the classification of any underlying standard commercial process “software” or “technology” used to manufacture or test these ICs, provided all of the following apply:

      (i) Any utilized existing commercial “software” or “technology” specified under ECCNs 3D991, 3D992, 3D993, 3E001, 3E991, 3E992, 3E993, 9D515.d, 9D515.e, 9E515.d or 9E515.e does not meet the “required” standard (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) of any other ECCN on the CCL; and

      (ii) The functional capability of the hardware, “software,” or “technology” existing within the standard commercial fabrication process has not been modified ( by addition of special process steps or unique interpretation of design data), except as may be required or requested by the USG ( as a stipulation of contract performance) where all of the following apply:

      (A) The modifications do not change the ECCN of any item subject to the EAR (except to a less restrictive classification,  from an ECCN on the CCL to EAR99); and

      (B) The modifications are limited to the manufacture or testing of ICs by or for the USG as specified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section.

      (3)  Scenarios addressed by this section include the following:

      (i) If a commercially fabricated IC specified under ECCN 3A991 is tested by the USG (or by a person or entity in a contractual relationship with the USG) and meets the radiation-hardened parameters in ECCN 3A001.a.1, the classification of the IC does not change from ECCN 3A991 and the classifications of the underlying standard process “technology”, “equipment” and “software” do not change from their original ECCNs.

      (ii) If a standard commercial process for fabricating ICs includes certain “technology” specified under ECCN 3E001 ( for ICs specified under ECCN 3A001.a.1), or ECCN 9E515 ( for discrete electronic components specified under ECCNs 9A515.d or .e) and those process “technologies” are used to manufacture ICs and discrete electronic components for the U.S. Government, only the portion of the “technology” that is “required” meets the specifications under ECCN 3E001 or 9E515. Moreover, the use of these standard commercial processes does not presumptively result in the control of the resulting U.S. Government ICs under ECCN paragraphs 3A001.a.1 or 9A515.d or .e; instead, the ECCNs of the U.S. Government ICs subject to the EAR would be determined according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section.

      (iii) If a standard commercial IC fabrication process at a particular foundry is comprised of tools specified under ECCNs 3B001 or 3B991 or as EAR99, and where the “technology” is limited to “technology” specified under ECCN 3E991 or as EAR99, and that foundry (which typically produces ICs specified under ECCN 3A991 or as EAR99) were to deviate from its standard fabrication process ( by adding special process steps or design features) to produce a family of ICs designed to meet or exceed the radiation hardened parameters in ECCN paragraphs 3A001.a.1 or 9A515.d. or .e and intended for sale to U.S. and non-U.S. commercial and government customers, then the ECCN of the additional process “technology” that is “required” for producing those specific radiation hardened ICs would need to be separately evaluated and determined ( under ECCNs 3E001 and 9E515, as applicable).

      § 770.3   Interpretations related to exports of technology and software to destinations in Country Group D:1.

#### § § 770.3

      (a)  This section is intended to provide you additional guidance on how to determine whether your technology or software would be eligible for a License Exception, may be exported under NLR, or require a license, for export to Country Group D:1.

      (b)  The export of technology and software under a license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated on the face of the license. The only technology and software related to equipment exports that may be exported without a license is technology described in §§ 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR; operating technology and software described in § 740.13(a) of the EAR; sales technology described in § 740.13(b) of the EAR; and software updates described in § 740.13(c) of the EAR.

      (c)  (1) U.S.-origin technology does not lose its U.S.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of any other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar technical data prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or utilizes any U.S.-origin technology, is subject to the EAR in the same manner as the original U.S.-origin technology, including license requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subject to the EAR by reason of the  exclusions described in § 734.4 of the EAR.

      (2) U.S.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingled with foreign-origin software does not lose its U.S.-origin. Such commingled software is subject to the EAR is the same manner as the original U.S.-origin software, including license requirements, unless the commingled software is not subject to the EAR by reason of the  exclusions described in § 734.4 of the EAR.

      (d)  The following questions and answers are intended to further clarify the scope of technology and software eligible for a License Exception.

      (1)(i)  (A) Our engineers, in installing or repairing equipment, use techniques (experience as well as proprietary knowledge of the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment) that exceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions (including training) given to the customer. In some cases, it is also a condition of the license that such information provided to the customer be constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation, maintenance and operation situations.

      (B) Can we send an engineer (with knowledge and experience) to the customer site to perform the installation or repair, under the provisions of License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in § 740.13(a) of the EAR, if it is understood that he is restricted by our normal business practices to performing the work without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customer personnel?

      (ii)  Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origin data in a foreign country as defined in § 734.15 of the EAR. So long as the circumstances described here would not exceed that permitted under the License Exception TSU for operation technology and software, as described in § 740.13(a) of the EAR, this is not a “release” of technology and a license would not be required.

      (2)(i)  We plan, according to our normal business practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we have exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The training is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take place in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can we now proceed with this training at both locations under a License Exception?

      (ii)  (A) Provided that this is your normal training, and involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in § 740.13(a), the training may be provided within the limits of those provisions of License Exception TSU. The location of the training is not significant, as the export occurs at the time and place of the actual transfer or imparting of the technology to the customer's engineers.

      (B) Any training beyond that covered under the provisions of License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in § 740.13(a), but specifically represented in your license application as required for this customer installation, and in fact authorized on the face of the license or a separate technology license, may not be undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked.

      The ACEP voting members include the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, and Assistant Secretary-level representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, Justice (for encryption exports), Energy, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The appropriate representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of the Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency are non-voting members. The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration is the Chair. Appropriate acting Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretary or equivalent strength of any agency or department may serve in lieu of the Assistant Secretary of the concerned agency or department. Such representatives, regardless of rank, will speak and vote on behalf of their agencies or departments. The ACEP may invite Assistant Secretary-level representatives of other Government agencies or departments (other than those identified above) to participate in the activities of the ACEP when matters of interest to such agencies or departments are under consideration. Decisions are made by majority vote.

      See “Automated Export System.”

      (Cat 5) means a cryptographic algorithm using different, mathematically-related keys for encryption and decryption.

      These are associated items for any “component,” “end item,” or “system,” and which are not necessary for their operation, but which enhance their usefulness or effectiveness. For example, for a riding lawnmower, “accessories” and “attachments” will include the bag to capture the cut grass, and a canopy to protect the operator from the sun and rain. For purposes of this definition, “attachments” and “accessories” are the same.

      This is an item that is useful only when used in conjunction with an “end item.” “Components” are also commonly referred to as assemblies. For purposes of this definition an assembly and a “component” are the same. There are two types of “components”: “Major components” and “minor components.” A “major component” includes any assembled element which forms a portion of an “end item” without which the “end item” is inoperable. For example, for an automobile, “components” will include the engine, transmission, and battery. If you do not have all those items, the automobile will not function, or function as effectively. A “minor component” includes any assembled element of a “major component.” “Components” consist of “parts.” References in the CCL to “components” include both “major components” and “minor components.”

      § 774.1   Introduction.

#### § § 774.1

      (a)  In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes “items”—i.e., “commodities,” “software,” and “technology”—subject to the authority of BIS. The CCL does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL may contain a reference to such controls. In addition, those items “subject to the EAR” but not identified on the CCL are identified by the designator “EAR99.” See § 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are “subject to the EAR.” EAR Part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.

      (b)  (1) Prior to October 15, 2013, the CCL contained certain ECCNs that were only included as cross references to items subject to the export control regulations administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

      (2) ECCNs formerly listed on the CCL that, as of October 15, 2013 were subject to the export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 10 CFR part 110 are: 0A001, 0B001, 0B002, 0B003, 0B004, 0B005, 0B006, 0C001, 0C002, 0C004, 0C005, 0C006, 0C201 and 1C012.

      (3) The following multilateral export control regime reference is provided, as an additional point of historical reference: 0C201—INFCIRC 254 Part 1, 5.3.1(b).

      (c)  The CCL is contained in supplement no. 1 to this part, and supplement no. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.

      (d)  The use of double quotation marks on the CCL is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the CCL that are defined in part 772 (Definitions of Terms), or for purposes of ECCNs, where a definition is provided in the “related definitions” paragraph in the License Requirements section of ECCNs or sometimes in Notes and Technical Notes for particular ECCNs and that definition is specific to that particular ECCN. In this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the CCL that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. It is also a useful compliance practice to review the “Related Definitions” paragraph and Notes and Technical Notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular ECCN.

      (1)  If a term on the CCL uses double quotes it means there is a defined term in part 772. However, the absence of double quotes does not mean that a term used on the CCL is not defined in part 772. Because the CCL includes many terms that are defined in part 772, BIS's practice is to use double quotes for certain key terms and to use double quotes when needed for consistency with multilateral export control regime based entries, such as many derived from control lists, in particular for the Wassenaar Arrangement that also uses the double quotes convention. However, because of the large number of defined terms used on the CCL and a desire to avoid hindering readability by placing quotes around too many words used in particular ECCNs, BIS's practice is to not add double quotes around certain terms, such as items and commodities. This convention also applies to the use of double quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.

      (2)  The CCL also includes a convention regarding the use of single quotes. Single quotes on the CCL identify a term as a defined term in the context of a particular ECCN. This convention also applies to the use of single quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.

      (e)  In some instances chemicals are listed by name and CAS number. The list applies to chemicals of the same structural formula (including hydrates) regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different CAS numbers.

      § 781.2   Purposes of the Additional Protocol and APR.

#### § § 781.2

      (a)  The Additional Protocol is a supplement to the existing U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which entered into force in 1980. It provides the IAEA with access to additional information about civil nuclear and nuclear-related items, materials, and activities and with physical access to reportable locations where nuclear facilities, materials, or ores are located (to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities) and to other reportable locations and locations specified by the IAEA (to resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the U.S. Declaration). The Additional Protocol is based upon and is virtually identical to the IAEA Model Additional Protocol (see IAEA Information Circular, INFCIRC/540, at ), except that it excludes IAEA access to activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or to locations or information associated with such activities, and provides for managed access in connection with those same activities and to locations or information associated with those activities.

      (b)  The Additional Protocol is designed to enhance the effectiveness of the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement by providing the IAEA with information about aspects of the U.S. civil nuclear fuel cycle, including: Mining and concentration of nuclear ores; nuclear-related equipment manufacturing, assembly, or construction; imports, exports, and other activities involving certain source material (i.e., source material that has not reached the composition and purity suitable for fuel fabrication or for being isotopically enriched); imports and exports of specified nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material; nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities not involving nuclear material; and other activities involving nuclear material not currently subject to the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement (e.g., nuclear material that has been exempted from safeguards pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) June 1972).

      (c)  To fulfill certain obligations of the United States under the Additional Protocol, BIS has established the APR, which require the reporting of information to BIS (as described in parts 783 and 784 of the APR) from all persons and locations in the United States (as described in § 781.3(a) of the APR) with reportable activities. This information, together with information reported to other U.S. Government agencies and less any information to which the U.S. Government applies the national security exclusion, is aggregated into a U.S. declaration, which is submitted annually to the IAEA. The APR also provide for complementary access at such locations in accordance with the provisions in part 784 of the APR.

      § 781.3   Scope of the APR.

#### § § 781.3

      The Additional Protocol Regulations or APR implement certain obligations of the United States under the Protocol Additional to the Agreement Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency Concerning the Application of Safeguards in the United States of America, known as the Additional Protocol.

      (a)  The APR, promulgated by the Department of Commerce, shall apply to all persons and locations in the United States, :

      (1) Locations that are subject to the regulatory authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), pursuant to the NRC's regulatory jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 ); and

      (2) The following  (see definition in § 781.1 of the APR):

      (i) Department of Energy locations;

      (ii) Department of Defense locations;

      (iii) Central Intelligence Agency locations; and

      (iv) Department of State locations.

      (b)  The activities that are subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements described in the APR are found in parts 783 and 784 of this subchapter (APR).

      § 781.4   U.S. Government requests for information needed to satisfy the requirements of the APR or the Act.

#### § § 781.4

      From time-to-time, one or more U.S. Government agencies (i.e., the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the NRC, or BIS) may contact a location to request information that the U.S. Government has determined to be necessary to satisfy certain requirements of the APR or the Act (e.g., clarification requests or vulnerability assessments). If the manner of providing such information is not specified in the APR, the agency in question will provide the location with appropriate instructions.

      § 781.5   Authority.

#### § § 781.5

      The APR implement certain provisions of the Additional Protocol under the authority of the Additional Protocol Implementation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-401, 120 Stat. 2726 (December 18, 2006)). In Executive Order 13458 of February 4, 2008, the President delegated authority to the Department of Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement the Act, and consistent with the Act, to carry out appropriate functions not otherwise assigned in the Act, but necessary to implement certain declaration and complementary access requirements of the Additional Protocol and the Act.

      (2)  You must complete Form AP-5 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if you engaged in any of the activities specified in supplement no. 2 to this part.

      (3)  You must complete Form AP-6 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if your location is either a uranium hard-rock mine or an ore beneficiation plant that was in operating or suspended status (see § 781.1 of the APR for the definitions of “uranium hard-rock mine” and uranium hard-rock mines in “operating,” “suspended,” or “closed-down” status).

      (i) The  requirement for calendar year 2008 applies to:

      (A) Uranium hard-rock mines or ore beneficiation plants that were in operating or suspended status on October 31, 2008; and

      (B) Uranium hard-rock mines that have changed from operating or suspended status to closed-down status during calendar year 2008 (up to and including October 31, 2008). Mines that were closed down prior to calendar year 2008 and that remain in closed-down status do not have a reporting requirement.

      (ii) You are required to submit an  to BIS, for any calendar year that follows calendar year 2008, only if you commenced operations at a uranium hard-rock mine or an ore beneficiation plant during the previous calendar year (e.g., the commencement of operations would include, but not be limited to, the resumption of operations at a mine that was previously in “closed-down” status). Otherwise, see the  requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. For example, you must submit an  to indicate the closed-down status of any uranium hard-rock mine that was indicated in your most recent report to be in either operating or suspended status, but at which you ceased operations during the previous calendar year.

      (b)  You must submit either an  or a  to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if, during the previous calendar year, you continued to engage in civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities at a location for which you submitted an  to BIS in accordance with the APR reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (1)  You must submit an  to BIS if you have updates or changes to report concerning your location's activities during the previous calendar year. When preparing your , you must complete the same report forms that you used for submitting your  on these activities. However, additional report forms will be required if your location engaged in any civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities described in paragraph (a) of this section that you did not previously report to BIS. The appropriate report forms for each type of activity that must be reported under the APR are identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section. You must submit your  to BIS no later than January 31 of the year following any calendar year in which the activities took place or there were changes to previously “reported” activities (see supplement no. 1 to this part).

      (2)  You may submit a , in lieu of an , if you have no updates or changes concerning your location's activities (except the certifying official and dates signed and submitted) since your most recent report of activities to BIS. In order to satisfy the reporting requirements under this paragraph (b)(2), you must complete Form AP-16 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, no later than January 31 of the year following any calendar year in which there were no changes to previously “reported” activities or location information (see supplement no. 1 to this part).

      (3)  (i) If your  or your most recent  for a location indicates that all civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities described therein have ceased at that location, and no other reportable activities have occurred during the previous calendar year, then you do not have a reporting requirement for the location under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (ii) If your location ceases to engage in activities subject to the APR reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, and you have not previously reported this to BIS, you must submit an  covering the calendar year in which you ceased to engage in such activities.

      (iii) Closed-down mines should be reported only once.

      (c)  You must complete Forms AP-1, AP-2 and AP-14 for each import of equipment or non-nuclear material identified in supplement no. 3 to this part and submit these forms to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if BIS sends you written notification requiring that you provide information concerning imports of such equipment and non-nuclear material. These Forms must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the date that you receive written notification of this requirement from BIS (see supplement no. 1 to this part). BIS will provide such notification when it receives a request from the IAEA for information concerning imports of this type of equipment or non-nuclear material. The IAEA may request this information to verify that you received specified equipment or non-nuclear material that was shipped to you by a person, organization, or government from a foreign country.

      (d)  You must complete Forms AP-1, AP-2 and AP-15 and submit them to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if BIS sends you written notification requiring that you provide information about the activities conducted at your location, insofar as relevant for the purpose of safeguards. These Forms must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date that you receive written notification of this requirement from BIS (see supplement no. 1 to this part). BIS will provide such notification only if the IAEA specifically requests amplification or clarification concerning any information provided in the U.S. Declaration based on your report(s).

      (e)  A location that must submit an  to BIS, pursuant to the requirements of this section, is considered to be a reportable location with declared activities.

      § 784.1   Complementary access: General information on the purpose of complementary access, affected locations, and the role of BIS.

#### § § 784.1

      (a)  The Additional Protocol requires that the United States provide the IAEA with complementary access to locations specified in the U.S. declaration. The IAEA may request and be given complementary access to locations in the United States that are not included in the U.S. declaration as agreed to by the U.S. Government. The IAEA, upon request, will be granted complementary access to locations in the United States in accordance with the provisions of § 784.3 of the APR, which describes the scope and conduct of complementary access.

      (b)  The APR authorize the conduct of complementary access, at locations in the United States, for the following purposes.

      (1)  Complementary access may be conducted, on a selective basis, to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and nuclear related activities at reportable uranium hard-rock mines and ore beneficiation plants (see § 783.1(a)(3) of the APR).

      (2)  Complementary access may be conducted at other locations specified in the U.S. declaration (i.e., locations required to submit reports to BIS pursuant to § 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), and locations requested by the IAEA and agreed to by the U.S. Government, to resolve questions relating to the correctness and completeness of the information provided in the U.S. declaration or to resolve inconsistencies relating to that information.

      (i) In the event that the IAEA has a question about, or identifies an apparent inconsistency in, information contained in the U.S. declaration (e.g., information based on reports submitted to BIS by one of these locations, pursuant to § 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), the IAEA will provide the U.S. Government with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency. The IAEA will not draw any conclusions about the question or inconsistency, or request complementary access to a location, until the U.S. Government has been provided with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency, unless the IAEA considers that a delay in access would prejudice the purpose for which the access is sought.

      (ii) Upon receipt of a request from the IAEA for clarification concerning information contained in the U.S. declaration, BIS will provide written notification to the U.S. location. The U.S. location must provide BIS with all of the requested information to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency raised by the IAEA. Unless informed otherwise by BIS, the U.S. location will have 15 calendar days from its receipt of written notification to submit the required forms to BIS (see the  requirements in § 783.1(d) of the APR).

      (c)  All locations specified in the U.S. declaration and other locations requested by the IAEA and agreed to by the U.S. Government are subject to complementary access by the IAEA. In cases where access cannot be provided to locations specified by the IAEA, BIS may seek to provide complementary access to adjacent locations or to satisfy the purposes of complementary access (see paragraph (b) of this section) through other means.

      (d)  As the lead U.S. Government agency and point of contact for organizing and facilitating complementary access pursuant to the APR, BIS will:

      (1) Serve as the official U.S. Government host to the IAEA inspection team;

      (2) Provide prior written notification to any location that is scheduled to undergo complementary access;

      (3) Take appropriate action to obtain an administrative warrant in the event that a location does not consent to complementary access;

      (4) Upon request of the location, dispatch an advance team, if time and other circumstances permit, to the location to provide administrative and logistical support for complementary access and to assist with preparation for such access;

      (5) Accompany the IAEA Team throughout the duration of complementary access;

      (6) Assist the IAEA Team with complementary access activities and ensure that each activity adheres to the provisions of the Additional Protocol and to the requirements of the APR and the Act, including the conditions of any warrant issued thereunder; and

      (7) Assist in the negotiation and development of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement between the U.S. Government and the IAEA, if appropriate (see § 784.5 of the APR).

      § 784.2   Obtaining consent or warrants to conduct complementary access.

#### § § 784.2

      (a)  (1) For locations specified in the U.S. declaration and other locations specified by the IAEA, BIS will seek consent pursuant to IAEA complementary access requests. In instances where the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a location does not consent to such complementary access, BIS will seek administrative warrants as provided by the Act.

      (2) For locations specified by the IAEA where access cannot be provided, BIS may seek consent from an adjacent location pursuant to an IAEA complementary access request.

      (b)  The owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a location may consent to complementary access. The individual providing consent on behalf of the location represents that he or she has the authority to make this decision.

      (c)  (1) When the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of a location consents to a complementary access request, he or she is agreeing to provide the IAEA Team with the same degree of access as that authorized under § 784.3 of the APR. This includes providing access for the IAEA Team and Host Team to any area of the location, any item on the location, and any records that are necessary to comply with the APR and allow the IAEA Team to accomplish the purpose of complementary access, as authorized under § 784.1(b)(1) or (b)(2) of the APR, except for the following:

      (i) Information subject to the licensing jurisdiction of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), U.S. Department of State, under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130)—see § 784.3(b)(3) of the APR, which states that such access cannot be provided without prior U.S. Government authorization; and

      (ii) Activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or locations or information associated with such activities.

      (2) The Host Team Leader is responsible for determining whether or not the IAEA's request to obtain access to any area, building, or item, or to record or conduct the types of activities described in § 784.3 of the APR is consistent with the Additional Protocol and subsidiary arrangements to the Additional Protocol.

      § 784.3   Scope and conduct of complementary access.

#### § § 784.3

      (a)  IAEA complementary access shall be limited to accomplishing only those purposes that are appropriate to the type of location, as indicated in § 784.1(b) of the APR and shall be conducted in the least intrusive manner, consistent with the effective and timely accomplishment of such purposes. No complementary access may take place without the presence of a U.S. Government Host Team. No information of direct national security significance shall be provided to the IAEA during complementary access.

      (b)  This paragraph describes complementary access activities that are authorized under the APR.

      (1)  Depending on the type of location accessed, the IAEA Team may:

      (i) Perform visual observation of parts or areas of the location;

      (ii) Utilize radiation detection and measurement devices;

      (iii) Utilize non-destructive measurements and sampling;

      (iv) Examine relevant records (i.e., records appropriate for the purpose of complementary access, as authorized under § 784.1(b) of the APR), except that the following records may not be inspected unless the Host Team leader, after receiving input from representatives of the location and consulting with other members of the Host Team, determines that such access is both appropriate and necessary to achieve the relevant purpose described in § 784.1(b)(1) or (b)(2) of the APR:

      (A) Financial data (other than production data);

      (B) Sales and marketing data (other than shipment data);

      (C) Pricing data;

      (D) Personnel data;

      (E) Patent data;

      (F) Data maintained for compliance with environmental or occupational health and safety regulations; or

      (G) Research data (unless the data are reported on Form AP-3 or AP-4);

      (v) Perform location-specific environmental sampling; and

      (vi) Utilize other objective measures which have been demonstrated to be technically feasible and the use of which have been agreed to by the United States (“objective measures,” as used herein, means any verification techniques that would be appropriate for achieving the official purpose of complementary access, both in terms of their effectiveness and limited intrusiveness).

      (2)  In certain cases, IAEA inspectors may collect environmental samples (e.g., air, water, vegetation, soil, smears), at a location specified by the IAEA, for the purpose of assisting the IAEA to draw conclusions about the absence of undeclared nuclear material or nuclear activities over a wide area.

      (3)  ITAR-controlled technology shall not be made available to the IAEA Team without prior U.S. Government authorization. The owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location being accessed is responsible for identifying any ITAR-controlled technology at the location to the Host Team as soon as practicable following the receipt of notification from BIS of complementary access (see § 784.4(a) of the APR).

      (c)  Following the arrival of the IAEA Team and Host Team at a location subject to complementary access, and prior to the commencement of complementary access, representatives of the organization will provide the IAEA Team and Host Team with a briefing on the environmental, health, safety, and security regulations (e.g., regulations for protection of controlled environments within the location and for personal safety) that are applicable to the location and which must be observed. In addition, the organization's representatives may include in their briefing an overview of the location, the activities carried out at the location, and any administrative and logistical arrangements relevant to complementary access. The briefing may include the use of maps and other documentation deemed appropriate by the organization. The time spent for the briefing may not exceed one hour, and the content should be limited to that which relates to the purpose of complementary access. The briefing may also address any of the following:

      (1) Areas, buildings, and structures specific to any activities relevant to complementary access;

      (2) Administrative and logistical information;

      (3) Updates/revisions to reports required under the APR;

      (4) Introduction of key personnel at the location;

      (5) Location-specific subsidiary arrangement, if applicable; and

      (6) Proposed access plan to address the purpose of complementary access.

      (d)  The IAEA Team may visually observe areas or parts of the location, as agreed by the Host Team Leader, after the Host Team Leader has consulted with the organization's representative for the location.

      (e)  The location must be prepared to provide the IAEA Team with access to all supporting materials and documentation used by the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location to prepare reports required under the APR and to otherwise comply with the APR (see the records inspection and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 786.1 and 786.2 of the APR and paragraph (b) of this section, which describes the scope of complementary access activities authorized under the APR) and with appropriate accommodations in which the IAEA Team can review these supporting materials and documentation. Such access will be provided in appropriate formats (e.g., paper copies, electronic remote access by computer, microfilm, or microfiche) through the Host Team to the IAEA Team during the complementary access period or as otherwise agreed upon by the IAEA Team and Host Team Leader. If the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location does not have access to records for activities that took place under previous ownership, the previous owner must make such records available to the Host Team.

      (f)  As necessary, the Host Team will implement managed access measures (e.g., the removal of sensitive papers from office spaces and the shrouding of sensitive displays, stores, and equipment) to prevent the dissemination of proliferation sensitive information, to meet safety or physical protection requirements, to protect proprietary or commercially sensitive information, or to protect activities of direct national security significance to the United States, including locations or information associated with such activities. If the IAEA Team is unable to fully achieve its inspection aims under the managed access measures in place, the Host Team will make every reasonable effort to provide alternative means to allow the IAEA Team to meet these aims, consistent with the purposes of complementary access (as described in § 784.1(b) of the APR) and the requirements of this section. If a location-specific subsidiary arrangement applies (see § 784.5(b) of the APR), the Host Team shall, in consultation with the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location, implement managed access procedures consistent with the applicable location-specific subsidiary arrangement.

      (g)  Consistent with the provisions of the Additional Protocol, the Host Team will ensure, to the extent possible, that each complementary access is commenced, conducted, and concluded during ordinary business hours, but no complementary access shall be prohibited or otherwise disrupted from commencing, continuing or concluding during other hours.

      (h)  In carrying out their activities, the IAEA Team and Host Team shall observe federal, state, and local environmental, health, safety, and security regulations and environmental, health, safety, and security requirements established at the location, including those for the protection of controlled environments within a location and for personal safety. To the extent practicable, any such regulations and requirements that may apply to the conduct of complementary access at the location should be set forth in the location-specific subsidiary arrangement (if any).

      (i)  The Host Team shall accompany the IAEA Team, during their complementary access at the location, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this part of the APR.

      (j)  (1) The United States shall permit and protect free communications between the IAEA Team and IAEA Headquarters and/or Regional Offices, including attended and unattended transmission of information generated by IAEA containment and/or surveillance or measurement devices. The IAEA Team shall have the right, through consultation with the Host Team, to make use of internationally established systems of direct communications.

      (2) No document, photograph or other recorded medium, or sample relevant to complementary access may be removed or transmitted from the location by the IAEA Team without the prior consent of the Host Team.

      (k)  (1) In accordance with the Additional Protocol, the IAEA shall inform the United States of:

      (i) Any activities that took place in connection with complementary access to a location in the United States, including any activities concerning questions or inconsistencies that the IAEA may have brought to the attention of the United States, within 60 calendar days of the time that the activities occurred; and

      (ii) The findings or results of any activities that took place, including the findings and results of activities concerning questions or inconsistencies that the IAEA may have brought to the attention of the United States, within 30 calendar days of the time that such findings or results were reached by the IAEA.

      (2) BIS will provide the results of complementary access to the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the inspected location to the extent practicable.

      § 784.4   Notification, duration and frequency of complementary access.

#### § § 784.4

      (a)  Complementary access will be provided only upon the issuance of a written notice by BIS to the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be accessed. If BIS is unable to provide written notification to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, BIS may post a notice prominently at the location to be accessed.

      (1) —(i)  The notice shall include all appropriate information provided by the IAEA to the United States Government concerning:

      (A) The purpose of complementary access;

      (B) The basis for the selection of the location for complementary access;

      (C) The activities that will be carried out during complementary access;

      (D) The time and date that complementary access is expected to begin and its anticipated duration; and

      (E) The names and titles of the IAEA inspectors who will participate in complementary access.

      (ii)  The complementary access notification from BIS will request that the location inform BIS whether or not it will consent to complementary access. If a location does not agree to provide consent to complementary access within four hours of its receipt of the complementary access notification, BIS will seek an administrative warrant as provided in § 784.2(a)(1).

      (iii)  An advance team from BIS will be available to assist the location in preparing for complementary access. If the complementary access is a 24-hour advance notice, then the availability of an advance team may be limited. The location requesting advance team assistance will not be required to reimburse the U.S. Government for any costs associated with these activities. The location (in cooperation with the advance team, if available) will make preparations for complementary access, including the identification of any ITAR-controlled technology and/or national security information at the location (see § 784.3(b)(3) of the APR).

      (2)  The following table sets forth the notification procedures for complementary access.

      (3)  In accordance with the Additional Protocol, the IAEA shall notify the United States Government of a complementary access request not less than 24 hours prior to the arrival of the IAEA Team at the location. BIS will provide written notice to the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the location as soon as possible after BIS has received notification from the IAEA.

      (b)  The duration of complementary access will depend upon the nature of the complementary access request and the activities that will be conducted at the location. (See § 784.3(b) of the APR for a description of the types of complementary access activities authorized under the APR.)

      § 784.5   Subsidiary arrangements.

#### § § 784.5

      (a)  The United States Government may conclude a general subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA that governs complementary access activities, irrespective of the location (i.e., an arrangement that is not location-specific).

      (b) —(1)  If requested by the location or deemed necessary by the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government will negotiate a location-specific subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA. The purpose of such an arrangement is to establish procedures for conducting managed access at a specific declared location. If the location requests, it may participate in preparations for the negotiation of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA and may observe the negotiations to the maximum extent practicable. The existence of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement does not in any way limit the right of the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location to withhold consent to a request for complementary access.

      (2)  The form and content of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement will be determined by the IAEA and the U.S. Government, in consultation with the location, on a case-by-case basis.

      § 784.6   Post complementary access activities.

#### § § 784.6

      Upon receiving the IAEA's final report on complementary access, BIS will forward a copy of the report to the location for its review, in accordance with § 784.3(k)(2) of the APR. Locations may submit comments concerning the IAEA's final report to BIS, and BIS will consider them, as appropriate, when preparing its comments to the IAEA on the final report. BIS also will send locations a post complementary access letter detailing the issues that require follow-up action (see, for example, the  requirements in § 783.2(d) of the APR).

      § 785.3   Initiation of administrative proceedings.

#### § § 785.3

      (a)  Prior to the initiation of an administrative proceeding through issuance of a NOVA, the Bureau of Industry and Security will issue a letter of intent to charge. The letter of intent to charge will advise a respondent that BIS has conducted an investigation. The letter will give the respondent a specified period of time to contact BIS to discuss settlement of the allegations set forth in the letter of intent to charge. If the respondent does not contact BIS in the time period specified in the letter of intent to charge, the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, or such other Department of Commerce representative designated by the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, may initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding under this § 785.3 by issuing a NOVA.

      (b)  The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint and will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the maximum amount of the civil penalty that could be assessed. The NOVA also will inform the respondent of the requirement to request a hearing pursuant to § 785.4 of the APR.

      (c)  Service of the NOVA shall be made by certified mail or courier delivery with signed acknowledgment of receipt. The date of signed acknowledgment of receipt shall be the effective date of service of the NOVA. One copy of each paper shall be provided to each party in the delivery. BIS files the NOVA with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at the same time that it is sent to the respondent. The ALJ, in turn, will place the case on its docket and will notify both the respondent and BIS of the docket information.

      § 785.4   Request for hearing and answer.

#### § § 785.4

      (a)  If the respondent wishes to contest the NOVA issued by BIS, the respondent must submit a written request for a hearing to BIS within 15 business days from the date of service of the NOVA. If the respondent requests a hearing, the respondent must answer the NOVA within 30 calendar days from the date of the request for hearing. The request for a hearing and the respondent's answer to the NOVA must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), along with a copy of the NOVA, and served on the Office of Chief Counsel, and any other address(es) specified in the NOVA, in accordance with § 785.6 of the APR.

      (b)  The respondent's answer must be responsive to the NOVA and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's defense(s). The answer must specifically admit or deny each separate allegation in the NOVA; if the respondent is without knowledge, the answer will so state and this will serve as a denial. Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed to be an admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any additional or new matter that the respondent contends will support a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in the answer shall be deemed to be waived, and evidence supporting that defense or partial defense may be refused, except for good cause shown.

      (c)  The request for hearing, the answer to the NOVA, and all other papers and documentary evidence must be submitted in English.

      (d)  The failure of the respondent to file a request for a hearing and an answer within the times prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations set forth in the NOVA. If no hearing is requested and no answer is provided, a final order will be signed by the Secretary of Commerce, or by a designated United States Government official, and will constitute final agency action in the case.

      § 785.5   Representation.

#### § § 785.5

      An individual respondent may appear, in person, or be represented by a duly authorized officer or employee. A partner may appear on behalf of a partnership, or a duly authorized officer or employee of a corporation may appear on behalf of the corporation. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides, if not the United States. The U.S. Government will be represented by the Office of Chief Counsel. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other representative who has the power of attorney to represent the respondent, shall file a notice of appearance with the ALJ, or, in cases where settlement negotiations occur before any filing with the ALJ, with the Office of Chief Counsel.

      § 785.6   Filing and service of papers other than the Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA).

#### § § 785.6

      (a)  All papers to be filed with the ALJ shall be addressed to “Additional Protocol Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,” at the address set forth in the NOVA, or such other place as the ALJ may designate. Filing by United States certified mail, by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery is acceptable. Filing from a foreign country shall be by airmail, via facsimile, or by express or equivalent parcel delivery service. A copy of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on all parties.

      (b)  Service shall be made by United States certified mail, by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery of one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service on the government party in all proceedings shall be addressed to Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-3839, Washington, DC 20230, or sent via facsimile to (202) 482-0085. Service on a respondent shall be to the address to which the NOVA was sent, or to such other address as the respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other representative, service on counsel or other representative shall constitute service on that party.

      (c)  The date of filing or service is the day when the papers are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery service, or by facsimile. Refusal by the person to be served, or by the person's agent or attorney, of service of a document or other paper will be considered effective service of the document or other paper as of the date of such refusal.

      (d)  A certificate of service signed by the party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall accompany every paper, other than the NOVA, filed and served on the parties.

      (e)  In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period is to be included in the computation unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). In such instance, the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less—there is no cap on the period of time to which this exclusion applies, whenever the period of time prescribed or allowed by this part is computed in business days, rather than calendar days.

      § 785.7   Summary decision.

#### § § 785.7

      The ALJ may render a summary decision disposing of all or part of a proceeding on the motion of any party to the proceeding, provided that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the party is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.

      § 785.8   Discovery.

#### § § 785.8

      (a)  The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the ALJ or by waiver or agreement of the parties. The ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for protecting the confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive information, including Confidential Business Information (CBI) as defined by the Act.

      (b)  A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party may apply to the ALJ for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall be made at least 30 calendar days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless the ALJ specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the ALJ at least 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 business days after service, or within such additional time as the ALJ may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot either admit or deny such matters.

      (c)  Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.

      (d)  The ALJ may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the ALJ may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as the ALJ deems reasonable and appropriate. The ALJ may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In addition, enforcement by any district court of the United States in which venue is proper may be sought as appropriate.

      § 785.9   Subpoenas.

#### § § 785.9

      (a)  Upon the application of any party, supported by a satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the evidence would not otherwise be available, the ALJ may issue subpoenas to any person requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the ALJ deems relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt, challenge or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this paragraph, any district court of the United States, in which venue is proper, has jurisdiction to issue an order requiring any such person to comply with a subpoena. Any failure to obey an order of the court is punishable by the court as a contempt thereof.

      (b)  Subpoenas issued by the ALJ may be served by any of the methods set forth in § 785.6(b) of the APR.

      (c)  Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 business days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the ALJ determines, for good cause shown, that extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.

      § 785.10   Matters protected against disclosure.

#### § § 785.10

      (a)  The ALJ may limit discovery or introduction of evidence or issue such protective or other orders as in the ALJ's judgment may be needed to prevent undue disclosure of classified or sensitive documents or information. Where the ALJ determines that documents containing classified or sensitive matter must be made available to a party in order to avoid prejudice, the ALJ may direct the other party to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The ALJ may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain undisclosed. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.

      (b)  If the ALJ determines that the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (a) of this section is unsatisfactory, and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the ALJ may provide the parties with the opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.

      § 785.11   Prehearing conference.

#### § § 785.11

      (a) On the ALJ's own motion, or on request of a party, the ALJ may direct the parties to participate in a prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:

      (1) Simplification of issues;

      (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;

      (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; or

      (4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings.

      (b) The ALJ may order the conference proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, transcribed and filed with the ALJ.

      (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the ALJ may direct the parties to correspond with the ALJ to achieve the purposes of such a conference.

      (d) The ALJ will prepare a summary of any actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary will include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.

      § 785.12   Hearings.

#### § § 785.12

      (a)  Upon receipt of a valid request for a hearing, the ALJ shall, by agreement with all the parties or upon notice to all parties of at least 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of a request for a hearing, schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, DC, unless the ALJ determines, for good cause shown, that another location would better serve the interest of justice.

      (b)  Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the ALJ. All hearings will be closed, unless the ALJ for good cause shown determines otherwise. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the ALJ to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate weight, except that any evidence of settlement which would be excluded under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is not admissible. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation, and shall be subject to cross-examination.

      (c)  (1) A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and filed with the ALJ. If any party wishes to obtain a written copy of the transcript, that party shall pay the costs of transcription. The parties may share the costs if both want a transcript.

      (2) Upon such terms as the ALJ deems just, the ALJ may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by deposition and may admit an affidavit or report as evidence, provided that any affidavits or reports have been filed and served on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be subject to cross-examination.

      (d)  If a party fails to appear in person or by counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed. The party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceeding or action taken thereafter.

      § 785.13   Procedural stipulations.

#### § § 785.13

      Unless otherwise ordered and subject to § 785.14 of the APR, a written stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the ALJ will modify the procedures established by this part.

      § 785.14   Extension of time.

#### § § 785.14

      The parties may extend any applicable time limitation by stipulation filed with the ALJ before the time limitation expires, or the ALJ may, on the ALJ's own initiative or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration of any applicable time limitation, extend the time, except that the requirement that a hearing be demanded within 15 calendar days, and the requirement that a final agency decision be made within 60 calendar days, may not be modified.

      § 785.15   Post-hearing submissions.

#### § § 785.15

      All parties shall have the opportunity to file post-hearing submissions that may include findings of fact and conclusions of law, supporting evidence and legal arguments, exceptions to the ALJ's rulings or to the admissibility of evidence, and orders and settlements.

      § 785.16   Decisions.

#### § § 785.16

      (a)  After considering the entire record in the case, the ALJ will issue a recommended decision based on a preponderance of the evidence. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision based thereon as to whether the respondent has violated the Act. If the ALJ finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with respect to one or more allegations, the ALJ shall order dismissal of the allegation(s) in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the ALJ finds that one or more violations have been committed, the ALJ shall issue an order imposing administrative sanctions.

      (b)  In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the ALJ shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation(s), and, with respect to the respondent, the respondent's ability to pay the penalty, the effect of a civil penalty on the respondent's ability to continue to do business, the respondent's history of prior violations, and such other matters as justice may require.

      (c)  The ALJ shall immediately issue and serve the recommended decision (and order, if appropriate) to the Office of Chief Counsel, at the address in § 785.6(b) of the APR, and to the respondent, by courier delivery or overnight mail. The recommended decision and order will also be referred to the head of the designated executive agency for final decision and order.

      (d)  The recommended decision and order shall become the final agency decision and order unless, within 60 calendar days, the Secretary of Commerce, or a designated United States Government official, modifies or vacates it, or unless an appeal has been filed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

      (e)  The respondent may appeal the final agency decision within 30 calendar days after the date of certification. Petitions for appeal may be filed in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the Court of Appeals for the district in which the violation occurred.

      § 785.17   Settlement.

#### § § 785.17

      (a)  When the parties have agreed to a settlement of the case prior to issuance of a NOVA, a settlement proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal has been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the ALJ.

      (b)  The parties may enter into settlement negotiations at any time during the time a case is pending before the ALJ. If necessary, the parties may extend applicable time limitations or otherwise request that the ALJ stay the proceedings while settlement negotiations continue. When the parties have agreed to a settlement of the case, the Office of Chief Counsel will recommend the settlement to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, forwarding a proposed settlement agreement and order, which the Assistant Secretary will approve and sign. If a NOVA has been filed, the Office of Chief Counsel will send a copy of the settlement proposal to the ALJ.

      (c)  Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this Part. The government officials involved have neither the authority nor the responsibility for initiating, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.

      (d)  Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed, absent a showing of good cause. Appeals and requests to reopen settled cases must be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement within 30 calendar days of the execution of a settlement agreement.

      § 785.18   Record for decision.

#### § § 785.18

      (a)  The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders, all papers and requests filed in the proceedings, and, for purposes of any appeal under § 785.16 of the APR, the decision of the ALJ and such submissions as are provided for under § 785.16 of the APR will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision. When a case is settled, the record will consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the NOVA or draft NOVA, settlement agreement, and order.

      (b)  On the ALJ's own motion, or on the motion of any party, the ALJ may direct that there be a restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to restrict access to any portion of the record is responsible, prior to the close of the proceeding, for submitting a version of the document(s) proposed for public availability that reflects the requested deletion. The restricted access portion of the record will be placed in a separate file and the file will be clearly marked to avoid improper disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the official record in the proceedings. The ALJ may act at any time to permit material that becomes declassified or unrestricted through passage of time to be transferred to the unrestricted access portion of the record.

      (c) —(1)  All NOVAs and draft NOVAs, answers, settlement agreements, decisions and orders disposing of a case will be displayed on the BIS Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Web site, at  which is maintained by the Office of Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce. The Office of Administration does not maintain a separate inspection facility. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be made available on request.

      (2)  The record for decision will be available only after the final administrative disposition of a case. Parties may seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under paragraph (b) of this section.

      § 785.19   Payment of final assessment.

#### § § 785.19

      (a)  Full payment of the civil penalty must be made within 30 days of the effective date of the order or within such longer period of time as may be specified in the order. Payment shall be made in the manner specified in the NOVA.

      (b)  The government party may, through the Attorney General, file suit in an appropriate district court if necessary to enforce compliance with a final order issued under the APR. This suit will include a claim for interest at current prevailing rates from the date of expiration of the 60-day period referred to in § 785.16(d), or the date of the final order, as appropriate.

      (c)  The amount of any civil penalty imposed by a final order may be deducted from any sum(s) owed by the United States to a respondent.

      § 785.20   Reporting a violation.

#### § § 785.20

      If a person learns that a violation of the Additional Protocol, the Act, or the APR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify: Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-4520, Washington, DC 20230; Tel: (202) 482-1208; Facsimile: (202) 482-0964.

      § 786.1   Inspection of records.

#### § § 786.1

      Upon request by BIS, you must permit access to and copying of any record relating to compliance with the requirements of the APR. This requires that you make available the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating, reading, and reproducing any record. Copies may be necessary to facilitate IAEA Team review of documents during complementary access. The IAEA Team may not remove these documents from the location without BIS authorization (see § 784.3(j)(2) of the APR).

      § 786.2   Recordkeeping.

#### § § 786.2

      (a)  Each person and location required to submit a report or correspondence under parts 782 through 784 of the APR must retain all supporting materials and documentation used to prepare such report or correspondence.

      (b)  All supporting materials and documentation required to be kept under paragraph (a) of this section must be retained for three years from the due date of the applicable report or for three years from the date of submission of the applicable report, whichever is later. Due dates for reports and correspondence are indicated in parts 782 through 784 of the APR.

      (c)  Records retained under this section must be maintained at the location or must be accessible at the location for purposes of complementary access at the location by IAEA Teams.

      (d)  (1) You may maintain reproductions instead of the original records, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met.

      (2) If you must maintain records under this part, you may use any photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic, automated archival storage, or other process that completely, accurately, legibly and durably reproduces the original records (whether on paper, microfilm, or through electronic digital storage techniques). The process must meet all of the following requirements, which are applicable to all systems:

      (i) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.

      (ii) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, information, and other characteristics of the original record, including both obverse and reverse sides (unless blank) of paper documents in legible form.

For purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of a letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable and readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognized as complete words or numbers.

      (iv) The system must preserve the initial image (including both obverse and reverse sides, unless blank, of paper documents) and record all changes, who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially recorded.

      (v) You must establish written procedures to identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and maintenance of the system.

      (vi) You must keep a record of where, when, by whom, and on what equipment the records and other information were entered into the system.

      (3)  For systems based on the storage of digital images, the system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system. The system must be able to locate and reproduce all records according to the same criteria that would have been used to organize the records had they been maintained in original form.

      (4)  For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature photographic processes, the records must be maintained according to an index of all records in the system following the same criteria that would have been used to organize the records had they been maintained in original form.

      § 786.3   Destruction or disposal of records.

#### § § 786.3

      If BIS or any other authorized U.S. government agency makes a formal or informal request for a certain record or records, such record or records may not be destroyed or disposed of without the written authorization of the requesting entity.

        § 791.1   Purpose.

#### § § 791.1

        (a) This part sets forth the procedures by which the Secretary may:

        (1) Determine whether any acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any information and communications technology or service, including but not limited to connected software applications, (ICTS Transaction) that has been designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries poses certain undue or unacceptable risks as identified in the Executive Order. For purposes of these regulations, the Secretary will consider ICTS to be designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by a person owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary where such a person operates, manages, maintains, or services the ICTS;

        (2) Issue a determination to prohibit an ICTS Transaction;

        (3) Direct the timing and manner of the cessation of the ICTS Transaction;

        (4) Consider factors that may mitigate the risks posed by the ICTS Transaction.

        (b) The Secretary will evaluate ICTS Transactions under this rule, which include, but are not limited to, classes of transactions, on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agency heads specified in Executive Order 13873 and other relevant governmental bodies, as appropriate, shall make an initial determination as to whether to prohibit a given ICTS Transaction or propose mitigation measures, by which the ICTS Transaction may be permitted. Parties may submit information in response to the initial determination, including a response to the initial determination and any supporting materials and/or proposed measures to remediate or mitigate the risks identified in the initial determination as posed by the ICTS Transaction at issue. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, the Secretary will issue a final determination prohibiting the transaction, not prohibiting the transaction, or permitting the transaction subject to the adoption of measures determined by the Secretary to sufficiently mitigate the risks associated with the ICTS Transaction. The Secretary shall also engage in coordination and information sharing, as appropriate, with international partners on the application of this part.

#### § § 791.107

        Within 30 days of service of the Secretary's notification pursuant to § 791.105, a party to an ICTS Transaction may respond to the Secretary's initial determination or assert that the circumstances resulting in the initial determination no longer apply, and thus seek to have the initial determination rescinded or mitigated pursuant to the following administrative procedures:

        (a) A party may submit arguments or evidence that the party believes establishes that insufficient basis exists for the initial determination, including any prohibition of the ICTS Transaction;

        (b) A party may propose remedial steps on the party's part, such as corporate reorganization, disgorgement of control of the foreign adversary, engagement of a compliance monitor, or similar steps, which the party believes would negate the basis for the initial determination;

        (c) Any submission must be made in writing;

        (d) A party responding to the Secretary's initial determination may request a meeting with the Department, and the Department may, at its discretion, agree or decline to conduct such meetings prior to making a final determination pursuant to § 791.109;
