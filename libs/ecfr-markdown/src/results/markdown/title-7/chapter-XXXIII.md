      § 3300.76   General.

#### § § 3300.76

      Only domestic owners are eligible to receive U.S. ATP certificates for equipment in service, with certification based upon the following:

      (a) For equipment which has not previously been certified:

      (1) For each unit of equipment, a test in a U.S. ATP testing station or in a testing station located in and approved by a country which is a Contracting Party, to measure the K-coefficient of the insulated body and the efficiency of the thermal appliance in accordance with § 3300.10 and § 3300.13 of this rule.

      (2) If the equipment consists of serially-produced equipment manufactured by a particular equipment manufacturer, and belonging to one owner, certification may be based upon the following:

      (i) A test of 1 percent of the units of equipment as prescribed in preceding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the units tested to serve as reference equipment.

      (ii) An inspection of each unit of equipment, using the procedures set forth in ATP, Annex 1, Appendix 2, paragraphs 29 and 49. The inspections shall be performed by one of the following, at the choice of the owner:

      (A) Persons in the owner's organization whom the owner deems qualified to perform inspections, or;

      (B) By an independent inspection agency which the owner deems competent to perform inspections. Fees charged by such inspection agency shall be payable directly to the agency by the owner.

      (iii) A report of each inspection shall be completed on a form corresponding to the pertinent test report model in ATP, Annex 1, Appendix 2. Report forms may be obtained by a request to the ATP manager.

      (b) For renewal of a U.S. ATP certificate which is nearing its expiration date, any of the following three procedures:

      (2) If the equipment is serially-produced by a particular manufacturer and belongs to one owner, test and inspection of the equipment according to the procedures prescribed in preceding paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, or;

      (3) An inspection of each unit of equipment as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      (c) For equipment which is currently certified according to a U.S. ATP certificate, and which has been transferred from one domestic owner to another, the new owner may obtain a U.S. ATP certificate by submitting the original or certified true copy of the certificate issued to the previous owner, and by performing an inspection and submitting an inspection report for each unit of equipment.

      (d) For equipment which is currently certified according to a Foreign-ATP certificate, and which has been transferred from a foreign owner to a domestic owner, the domestic owner may obtain a U.S. ATP certificate by submitting the original or certified true copy of the test report for the reference equipment and the original or certified true copy of the foreign certificate, and by performing an inspection and submitting an inspection report for each unit of equipment.

      (e) Owners who receive a U.S. ATP certificate have the responsibility to maintain equipment in good repair and operating condition with the understanding that the certificate is valid only so long as:

      (1) The insulated body and the thermal appliance are maintained in good condition;

      (2) No material alteration is made to the thermal appliance which decreases its refrigeration capacity, and;

      (3) If the thermal appliance is replaced, it is replaced by an appliance of equal or greater refrigerating capacity.
