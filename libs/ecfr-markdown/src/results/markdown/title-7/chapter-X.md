#### § § 1000.27

      Each handler shall maintain and retain records of its operations and make such records and its facilities available to the market administrator. If adequate records of a handler, or of any other persons, that are relevant to the obligation of such handler are not maintained and made available, any skim milk and butterfat required to be reported by such handler for which adequate records are not available shall be considered as used in the highest-priced class.

      (a)  (1) Each handler shall maintain records of its operations (including, but not limited to, records of purchases, sales, processing, packaging, and disposition) as are necessary to verify whether such handler has any obligation under the order and if so, the amount of such obligation. Such records shall be such as to establish for each plant or other receiving point for each month:

      (i) The quantities of skim milk and butterfat contained in, or represented by, products received in any form, including inventories on hand at the beginning of the month, according to form, time, and source of each receipt;

      (ii) The utilization of all skim milk and butterfat showing the respective quantities of such skim milk and butterfat in each form disposed of or on hand at the end of the month; and

      (iii) Payments to producers, dairy farmers, and cooperative associations, including the amount and nature of any deductions and the disbursement of money so deducted.

      (2) Each handler shall keep such other specific records as the market administrator deems necessary to verify or establish such handler's obligation under the order.

      (b)  Each handler shall make available all records pertaining to such handler's operations and all facilities the market administrator finds are necessary to verify the information required to be reported by the order and/or to ascertain such handler's reporting, monetary, or other obligation under the order. Each handler shall permit the market administrator to weigh, sample, and test milk and milk products and observe plant operations and equipment and make available to the market administrator such facilities as are necessary to carry out his/her duties.

      (c)  All records required under the order to be made available to the market administrator shall be retained by the handler for a period of 3 years to begin at the end of the month to which such records pertain. If, within such 3-year period, the market administrator notifies the handler in writing that the retention of such records, or of specified records, is necessary in connection with a proceeding under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act or a court action specified in such notice, the handler shall retain such records, or specified records, until further written notification from the market administrator. The market administrator shall give further written notification to the handler promptly upon the termination of the litigation or when the records are no longer necessary in connection therewith.

      § 1000.28   Termination of obligations.

#### § § 1000.28

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the obligation of any handler to pay money required to be paid under the terms of the order shall terminate 2 years after the last day of the month during which the market administrator receives the handler's report of receipts and utilization on which such obligation is based, unless within such 2-year period, the market administrator notifies the handler in writing that such money is due and payable. Service of such written notice shall be complete upon mailing to the handler's last known address and it shall contain, but need not be limited to, the following information:

      (1) The amount of the obligation;

      (2) The month(s) on which such obligation is based; and

      (3) If the obligation is payable to one or more producers or to a cooperative association, the name of such producer(s) or such cooperative association, or if the obligation is payable to the market administrator, the account for which it is to be paid.

      (b) If a handler fails or refuses, with respect to any obligation under the order, to make available to the market administrator all records required by the order to be made available, the market administrator may notify the handler in writing, within the 2-year period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, of such failure or refusal. If the market administrator so notifies a handler, the said 2-year period with respect to such obligation shall not begin to run until the first day of the month following the month during which all such records pertaining to such obligation are made available to the market administrator.

      (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a handler's obligation under the order to pay money shall not be terminated with respect to any transaction involving fraud or willful concealment of a fact, material to the obligation, on the part of the handler against whom the obligation is sought to be imposed.

      (d) Unless the handler files a petition pursuant to section 8c(15)(A) of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations (7 CFR 900.50 through 900.71) within the applicable 2-year period indicated below, the obligation of the market administrator:

      (1) To pay a handler any money which such handler claims is due under the terms of the order shall terminate 2 years after the end of the month during which the skim milk and butterfat involved in the claim were received; or

      (2) To refund any payment made by a handler (including a deduction or offset by the market administrator) shall terminate 2 years after the end of the month during which payment was made by the handler.

      § 1000.41   [Reserved]

#### § § 1000.41

      § 1000.42   Classification of transfers and diversions.

#### § § 1000.42

      (a)  Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant or a handler described in § 1135.11 of this chapter to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk unless the handlers both request the same classification in another class. In either case, the classification shall be subject to the following conditions:

      (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, remaining in such class at the receiving plant after the computations pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

      (2) If the transferring plant received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3) or the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and

      (3) If the transferring handler received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) or (9) or the corresponding steps of § 1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the receiving plant.

      (b)  Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to a plant regulated under another Federal order shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any receipts at the pool plant from a plant regulated under another Federal order of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section:

      (1) As Class I milk, if transferred as packaged fluid milk products;

      (2) If transferred or diverted in bulk form, classification shall be in the classes to which allocated under the other order:

      (i) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of receipts and utilization filed with their respective market administrators, transfers in bulk form shall be classified as other than Class I to the extent that such utilization is available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions of the other order;

      (ii) If diverted, the diverting handler must request a classification other than Class I. If the plant receiving the diverted milk does not have sufficient utilization available for the requested classification and some of the diverted milk is consequently assigned to Class I use, the diverting handler shall be given the option of designating the entire load of diverted milk as producer milk at the plant physically receiving the milk. Alternatively, if the diverting handler so chooses, it may designate which dairy farmers whose milk was diverted during the month will be designated as producers under the order physically receiving the milk. If the diverting handler declines to accept either of these options, the market administrator will prorate the portion of diverted milk in excess of Class II, III, and IV use among all the dairy farmers whose milk was received from the diverting handler on the last day of the month, then the second-to-last day, and continuing in that fashion until the excess diverted milk has been assigned as producer milk under the receiving order; and

      (iii) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall be Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available.

      (c)  Skim milk or butterfat that is transferred or diverted from a pool plant to a producer-handler under any Federal order or to an exempt plant shall be classified:

      (1) As Class I milk if transferred or diverted to a producer-handler;

      (2) As Class I milk if transferred to an exempt plant in the form of a packaged fluid milk product; and

      (3) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market administrator if transferred or diverted in the form of a bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product to an exempt plant. For this purpose, the receiving handler's utilization of skim milk and butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, shall be assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and butterfat, in bulk fluid cream products, and bulk fluid milk products, respectively, pro rata to each source.

      (d)  Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool plant to a nonpool plant that is not a plant regulated under another order, an exempt plant, or a producer-handler plant shall be classified:

      (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid milk product; and

      (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product, unless the following conditions apply:

      (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's utilization, excluding the milk equivalent of both nonfat milk solids and concentrated milk used in the plant during the month, to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (viii) of this section:

      (A) The transferring handler or diverting handler claims such classification in such handler's report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant to § __.30 of each Federal milk order for the month within which such transaction occurred; and

      (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the market administrator;

      (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:

      § 1000.43   General classification rules.

#### § § 1000.43

      In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to § 1000.44, the following rules shall apply:

      (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to § __.30 of each Federal milk order and shall compute separately for each pool plant, for each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with §§ 1000.40 and 1000.42, and paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b)  For purposes of classifying all milk reported by a handler pursuant to § __.30 of each Federal milk order the market administrator shall determine the shrinkage or overage of skim milk and butterfat for each pool plant and each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter by subtracting total utilization from total receipts. Any positive difference shall be shrinkage, and any negative difference shall be overage.

      (1) Shrinkage incurred by pool plants qualified pursuant to § __.7 of any Federal milk order shall be assigned to the lowest-priced class to the extent that such shrinkage does not exceed:

      (i) Two percent of the total quantity of milk physically received at the plant directly from producers' farms on the basis of farm weights and tests;

      (ii) Plus 1.5 percent of the quantity of bulk milk physically received on a basis other than farm weights and tests, excluding concentrated milk received by agreement for other than Class I use;

      (iii) Plus .5 percent of the quantity of milk diverted by the plant operator to another plant on a basis other than farm weights and tests; and

      (iv) Minus 1.5 percent of the quantity of bulk milk transferred to other plants, excluding concentrated milk transferred by agreement for other than Class I use.

      (2) A handler described in § 1000.9(c) or § 1135.11 of this chapter that delivers milk to plants on a basis other than farm weights and tests shall receive a lowest-priced-class shrinkage allowance of .5 percent of the total quantity of such milk picked up at producers' farms.

      (3) Shrinkage in excess of the amounts provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section shall be assigned to existing utilization in series starting with Class I. The shrinkage assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall be added to the handler's reported utilization and the result shall be known as the

      (c) If any of the water but none of the nonfat solids contained in the milk from which a product is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by the handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids. If any of the nonfat solids contained in the milk from which a product is made are removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by the handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product plus all of the water and nonfat solids originally associated with such solids determined on a protein equivalent basis.

      (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments under § 1000.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under § 1000.44 on a pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by the handler.

      § 1000.44   Classification of producer milk.

#### § § 1000.44

      For each month the market administrator shall determine for each handler described in § 1000.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler separately and for each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter the classification of producer milk by allocating the handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the handler's gross utilization of such receipts pursuant to § 1000.43(b)(3) as follows:

      (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:

      (1) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class I the pounds of skim milk in:

      (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;

      (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another Federal order in the immediately preceding month;

      (iii) Fluid milk products received in packaged form from plants regulated under other Federal orders; and

      (iv) To the extent that the receipts described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section exceed the gross Class I utilization of skim milk, the excess receipts shall be subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section.

      (2) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of skim milk in the receipts of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used to produce, or added to, any product in Class II (excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class IV milk pursuant to § 1000.40(d)(3)). To the extent that the receipts described in this paragraph exceed the gross Class II utilization of skim milk, the excess receipts shall be subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section.

      (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in:

      (i) Receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated fluid milk product);

      (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products for which appropriate health approval is not established and from unidentified sources;

      (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products from an exempt plant;

      (iv) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a producer-handler as defined under the order in this part, or any other Federal order;

      (v) Receipts of fluid milk products from dairy farmers for other markets; and

      (vi) The excess receipts specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (a)(2) of this section.

      (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, the receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section for which the handler requests classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in these other classes combined.

      (5) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section, and which are in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section;

      (i) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at this allocation step; and

      (ii) Subtract from the result in paragraph (a)(5)(i) the pounds of skim milk in receipts of producer milk and fluid milk products from other pool plants.

      (6) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from a handler regulated under another Federal order that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such handler, if other than Class I classification is requested, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in these classes combined.

      (7) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products in inventory at the beginning of the month that were not previously subtracted in this section.

      (8) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at the plant receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section and that were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated at this step were received. Such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in Class I and in Classes II, III, and IV combined, with the quantity prorated to Classes II, III, and IV combined being subtracted in sequence beginning with Class IV.

      (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from a handler regulated under another Federal order that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such handler that were not subtracted in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in Class I and in Classes II, III, and IV combined, with the quantity prorated to Classes II, III, and IV combined being subtracted in sequence beginning with Class IV, with respect to whichever of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:

      (i) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each class as announced for the month pursuant to § 1000.45(a); or

      (ii) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step.

      (10) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products from another pool plant and from a handler described in § 1135.11 of this chapter according to the classification of such products pursuant to § 1000.42(a).

      (11) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class IV.

      (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      § 1000.45   Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

#### § § 1000.45

      (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from plants regulated under other Federal orders pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), the market administrator shall estimate and publicly announce the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in Class I during the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. The estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall be final for such purpose.

      (b) The market administrator shall report to the market administrators of other Federal orders as soon as possible after the handlers' reports of receipts and utilization are received, the class to which receipts from plants regulated under other Federal orders are allocated pursuant to §§ 1000.43(d) and 1000.44 (including any reclassification of inventories of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter any change in allocation required to correct errors disclosed on the verification of such report.

      (c) The market administrator shall furnish each handler operating a pool plant and each handler described in § 1135.11 of this chapter who has shipped fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to a plant fully regulated under another Federal order the class to which the shipments were allocated by the market administrator of the other Federal order on the basis of the report by the receiving handler and, as necessary, any changes in the allocation arising from the verification of such report.

      (d) The market administrator shall report to each cooperative association which so requests, the percentage of producer milk delivered by members of the association that was used in each class by each handler receiving the milk. For the purpose of this report, the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in accordance with the total utilization of producer milk by the handler.

    Subpart G—Class Prices

      § 1000.50   Class prices, component prices, and advanced pricing factors.

#### § § 1000.50

      Class prices per hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat, component prices, and advanced pricing factors shall be as follows. The prices and pricing factors described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (q) of this section shall be based on a weighted average of the most recent 2 weekly prices announced by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) before the 24th day of the month.

      (f)  The Class II nonfat solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class II skim milk price divided by 9.

      (g)  The Class II butterfat price per pound shall be the butterfat price plus $0.007.

      (h)  The Class III price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be 0.965 times the Class III skim milk price plus 3.5 times the butterfat price.

      (i)  The Class III skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the protein price per pound times 3.1 plus the other solids price per pound times 5.9.

      (j)  The Class IV price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be 0.965 times the Class IV skim milk price plus 3.5 times the butterfat price.

      (k)  The Class IV skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the nonfat solids price per pound times 9.

      (l)  The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS AA Butter survey price reported by the Department for the month, less 17.15 cents, with the result multiplied by 1.211.

      (m)  The nonfat solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS nonfat dry milk survey price reported by the Department for the month, less 16.78 cents and multiplying the result by 0.99.

      (n)  The protein price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed as follows:

      (1) Compute a weighted average of the amounts described in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

      (i) The U.S. average NASS survey price for 40-lb. block cheese reported by the Department for the month; and

      (ii) The U.S. average NASS survey price for 500-pound barrel cheddar cheese (38 percent moisture) reported by the Department for the month plus 3 cents;

      (o)  The other solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS dry whey survey price reported by the Department for the month minus 19.91 cents, with the result multiplied by 1.03.

      (p)  The somatic cell adjustment per hundredweight of milk shall be determined as follows:

      (1) Multiply 0.0005 by the weighted average price computed pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section and round to the 5th decimal place;

      (2) Subtract the somatic cell count of the milk (reported in thousands) from 350; and

      (3) Multiply the amount computed in paragraph (p)(1) of this section by the amount computed in paragraph (p)(2) of this section and round to the nearest full cent.

      (q)  For the purpose of computing the Class I skim milk price, the Class II skim milk price, the Class II nonfat solids price, and the Class I butterfat price for the following month, the following pricing factors shall be computed using the weighted average of the 2 most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month:

      (1) An advanced Class III skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

      (i) Following the procedure set forth in paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section, but using the weighted average of the 2 most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of the month, compute a protein price and an other solids price;

      (ii) Multiply the protein price computed in paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section by 3.1;

      (iii) Multiply the other solids price per pound computed in paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section by 5.9; and

      (iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraphs (q)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

      (2) An advanced Class IV skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

      § 1000.70   Producer-settlement fund.

#### § § 1000.70

      The market administrator shall establish and maintain a separate fund known as the producer-settlement fund into which the market administrator shall deposit all payments made by handlers pursuant to §§ ____.71, ____.76, and ____.77 of each Federal milk order and out of which the market administrator shall make all payments pursuant to §§ ____.72 and ____.77 of each Federal milk order. Payments due any handler shall be offset by any payments due from that handler.

      § 1000.76   Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

#### § § 1000.76

      On or before the 25th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90), the operator of a partially regulated distributing plant, other than a plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of producer returns under a State government's milk classification and pricing program, shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or, if the handler submits the information specified in §§ ____.30(b) and ____.31(b) of the order, the handler may elect to pay the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. A partially regulated distributing plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of producer returns under a State government's milk classification and pricing program shall pay the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be an amount resulting from the following computations:

      (1) From the plant's route disposition in the marketing area:

      (i) Subtract receipts of fluid milk products classified as Class I milk from pool plants, plants fully regulated under other Federal orders, and handlers described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter, except those receipts subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order;

      (ii) Subtract receipts of fluid milk products from another nonpool plant that is not a plant fully regulated under another Federal order to the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of to the nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any payment obligation under any order; and

      (iii) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk made from nonfluid milk products which are disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area;

      (2) For orders with multiple component pricing, compute a Class I differential price by subtracting Class III price from the current month's Class I price. Multiply the pounds remaining after the computation in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by the amount by which the Class I differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant except that neither the adjusted Class I differential price nor the adjusted producer price differential shall be less than zero;

      (3) For orders with skim milk and butterfat pricing, multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I price exceeds the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant except that neither the adjusted Class I price nor the adjusted uniform price differential shall be less than the lowest announced class price; and

      (4) Unless the payment option described in paragraph (d) is selected, add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by any positive difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant (less $1.00 if the reconstituted milk is labeled as such) and the Class IV price.

      (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting from the following computations:

      (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to § ____.60 of the order for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:

      (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at the plant from a pool plant, a plant fully regulated under another Federal order, and handlers described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the fully regulated plant;

      (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or a plant fully regulated under another Federal order shall be classified at the partially regulated distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant from the pool plant and plants fully regulated under other Federal orders that are classified in the corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are in Class I and for which a value is computed pursuant to § ____.60 of the order for the partially regulated distributing plant shall be priced at the statistical uniform price or uniform price, whichever is applicable, of the respective order regulating the handling of milk at the receiving plant, with such statistical uniform price or uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest announced class price of the respective order); and

      (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant so requests, the handler's value of milk determined pursuant to § ____.60 of the order shall include a value of milk determined for each nonpool plant that is not a plant fully regulated under another Federal order which serves as a supply plant for the partially regulated distributing plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant during the month equivalent to the requirements of § ____. 7(c) of the order subject to the following conditions:

      (A) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant submits with its reports filed pursuant to §§ ____.30(b) and ____.31(b) of the order similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;

      (B) The operator of the nonpool plant maintains books and records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at the plant which are made available if requested by the market administrator for verification purposes; and

      (C) The value of milk determined pursuant to § ____.60 for the unregulated supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed for computing the obligation of the partially regulated distributing plant; and

      (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:

      (i) The gross payments that were made for milk that would have been producer milk had the plant been fully regulated;

      (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant for milk received at the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and

      (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under which the plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant and, if paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, payments made by the operator of the nonpool supply plant to the producer-settlement fund of any order.

      (c) The operator of a partially regulated distributing plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of returns under a milk classification and pricing program that is imposed under the authority of a State government shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund an amount computed as follows:

      After completing the computations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, determine the value of the remaining pounds of fluid milk products disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area by multiplying the hundredweight of such pounds by the amount, if greater than zero, that remains after subtracting the State program's class prices applicable to such products at the plant's location from the Federal order Class I price applicable at the location of the plant.

      (d) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk ingredients that are reconstituted for fluid use. Payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the positive difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed and the Class IV price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.

      § 1000.77   Adjustment of accounts.

#### § § 1000.77

      Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, books, records, or accounts, or other verification discloses errors resulting in money due the market administrator from a handler, or due a handler from the market administrator, or due a producer or cooperative association from a handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of any amount so due and payment thereof shall be made on or before the next date for making payments as set forth in the provisions under which the error(s) occurred.

      § 1000.78   Charges on overdue accounts.

#### § § 1000.78

      Any unpaid obligation due the market administrator, producers, or cooperative associations from a handler pursuant to the provisions of the order shall be increased 1.0 percent each month beginning with the day following the date such obligation was due under the order. Any remaining amount due shall be increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each succeeding month until paid. The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed monthly on each unpaid obligation and shall include any unpaid charges previously computed pursuant to this section. The late charges shall accrue to the administrative assessment fund. For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due.

The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ____.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which fluid milk products are transferred or diverted to plants described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section subject to the additional conditions described in this paragraph.

        (3) If milk is delivered directly from producers' farms that are located outside of the states included in the marketing area or outside Maine or West Virginia, such producers must be grouped by state into reporting units and each reporting unit must independently meet the shipping requirements of this paragraph; and

        (4) Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the percentages in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (d) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1001.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1001.7(a), (b), or (e);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1001.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (e) Two or more plants that are located in the marketing area and operated by the same handler may qualify as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route distribution requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit qualifies as a pool distributing plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process at least 60 percent of monthly receipts of producer milk only as Class I or Class II products and must be located in the Northeast marketing area, as defined in § 1001.2, in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant(s) included in the unit; and

        (3) A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants from a unit, or to cancel a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which unit formation is to be effective.

        (f) Two or more supply plants operated by the same handler, or by one or more cooperative associations, may qualify for pooling as a system of plants by meeting the applicable percentage requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) A supply plant system will be effective for the period of August 1 through July 31 of the following year. Written notification must be given to the market administrator listing the plants to be included in the system prior to the first day of July preceding the effective date of the system. The plants included in the system shall be listed in the sequence in which they shall qualify for pool plant status based on the minimum deliveries required. If the deliveries made are insufficient to qualify the entire system for pooling, the last listed plant shall be excluded from the system, followed by the plant next-to-last on the list, and continuing in this sequence until remaining listed plants have met the minimum shipping requirements; and

        (2) Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following July unless the plant subsequently fails to qualify for pooling, the handler submits a written notification to the market administrator prior to the first day of the month that the plant be deleted from the system, or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from the system, or that has failed to qualify as a pool plant in any month, will not be part of the system for the remaining months through July. For any system that qualifies in August, no plant may be added in any subsequent month through the following July unless the plant replaces another plant in the system that has ceased operations and the market administrator is notified of such replacement prior to the first day of the month for which it is to be effective.

        (g) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler plant;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located within the marketing area if the plant also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and more than 50 percent of its route distribution has been in such other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is not located within any Federal order marketing area that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located in another Federal order marketing area if the plant meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area; and

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order.

        (2) Of the total quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversion but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c) or which is diverted to another pool plant), the handler diverted to nonpool plants not more than 80 percent during each of the months of September through November and 90 percent during each of the months of January through August and December. In the event that a handler causes the milk of a producer to be over diverted, a dairy farmer will not lose producer status;

        (3) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted.

        (4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. The diverting handler shall designate the dairy farmer deliveries that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to designate the dairy farmer deliveries which are ineligible, producer milk status shall be forfeited with respect to all milk diverted to nonpool plants by such handler; and

        (5) The delivery day requirement and the diversion percentages in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the Market Administrator if the Market Administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the Market Administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the Market Administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired to be effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the Market Administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage or delivery day requirement must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of another government entity.

        § 1001.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1001.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (i) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Class I value. (1) Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b) Class II value. (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c) Class III value. (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d) Class IV value. (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (f) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (g) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (i) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1001.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1001.61

        For each month, the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1001.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions in this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1001.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1001.30;

        (b) Subtract the total of the values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1001.60 by the protein price, other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively;

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1001.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1001.60(h); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        § 1001.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1001.73

        (a) Each handler that is not paying a cooperative association for producer milk shall pay each producer as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 23rd day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 26th day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the lowest announced class price for the preceding month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, payment shall be made during the following month so it is received by each producer no later than the day after the required date of payment by the Market Administrator, pursuant to § 1001.72, in an amount computed as follows:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received by the producer price differential for the month as adjusted pursuant to § 1001.75;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of butterfat received by the butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the pounds of protein received by the protein price for the month;

        (iv) Multiply the pounds of other solids received by the other solids price for the month; and

        (v) Add the amounts computed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) One day before partial and final payments are due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by the lowest announced class price for the preceding month.

        (2)  For bulk milk/skimmed milk products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  Following the classification of bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment for such receipts shall be determined as follows:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of Class I skim milk by the Class I skim milk price for the month at the receiving plant;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of Class I butterfat by the Class I butterfat price for the month at the receiving plant;

        (iii) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price;

        (iv) Multiply the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price;

        (v) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV milk by the nonfat solids price for the month;

        (vi) Multiply the pounds of butterfat in Class III and Class IV milk by the butterfat price for the month;

        (viii) Multiply the pounds of other solids in Class III milk by the other solids price for the month; and

        (ix) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section and from that sum deduct any payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1001.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce payments pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but by not more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall furnish each producer (except for a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or 9(c)), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and the payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The month and dates that milk was received from the producer, including the daily and total pounds of milk received;

        (3) The total pounds of butterfat, protein, and other solids contained in the producer's milk;

        (4) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (5) The rate used in making payment if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        § 1005.7   Pool plant.

#### § § 1005.7

        means a plant specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, a unit of plants as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, or a plant specified in paragraph (g) of this section but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ____.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 50 percent or more of the fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 50 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which 50 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received during the month from dairy farmers and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted from the plant, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) A plant located within the marketing area or in the State of Virginia that is operated by a cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is requested for such plant by the cooperative association and during the month at least 60 percent of the producer milk of members of such cooperative association is delivered directly from farms to pool distributing plants or is transferred to such plants as a fluid milk product (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I) from the cooperative's plant.

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and that are located within the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process only Class I or Class II products and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (3) A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants from a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which it is to be effective.

        (f) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the date for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (g) Any distributing plant other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph § 1005.(7)(a) or paragraph (b) of this section or § ___.7(b) of any other Federal milk order or § 1005.(7)(e) or § 1000.(8)(a) or § 1000.(8)(e); located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1005.2, from which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusion:

        (1) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (2) A producer-handler described in § 1005.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler plant;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is not located within any Federal order marketing area, meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is located in another Federal order marketing area, meets the pooling standards of the other Federal order, and has not had a majority of its route disposition in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or is locked into pool status under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under such other order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or such plant has automatic pooling status under such other order; and

        (6) That portion of a pool plant designated as a “nonpool plant” that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.

Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.

        § 1005.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1005.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (f) of this section. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to § 1000.44(c) by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts; except that for the months of January 2005 through March 2005, the Class I skim milk price for this purpose shall be the Class I skim milk price as determined in § 1000.50(b) plus $0.04 per hundredweight, and the Class I butterfat price for this purpose shall be the Class I butterfat price as determined in § 1000.50(c) plus $0.0004 per pound. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein may be reduced by the market administrator for any month if the market administrator determines that the payments yet unpaid computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) and paragraph (g)(7) of this section will be less than the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein during the months of January 2005 through March 2005 shall be announced along with the prices announced in § 1000.53(b);

        (b) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;

        (c) Multiply the difference between the Class IV price for the preceding month and the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (d) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;

        (e) Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (f) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        (g) For the months of January 2005 through March 2005 for handlers who have submitted proof satisfactory to the market administrator to determine eligibility for reimbursement of transportation costs, subtract an amount equal to:

        (1) The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (2) The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool supply plant that was then transferred to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (3) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from a pool supply plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (4) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from another order plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne; and

        (5) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk transferred or diverted to a plant regulated under another Federal order or to other nonpool plants which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.

        (6) The total amount of payment to all handlers under this section shall be limited for each month to an amount determined by multiplying the total Class I producer milk for all handlers pursuant to § 1000.44(c) times $0.04 per hundredweight.

        (7) If the cost of transportation computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section exceeds the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the market administrator shall prorate such payments to each handler based on the handler's proportion of transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section. Transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section which are not paid as a result of such a proration shall be included in each subsequent month's transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section until paid, or until the time period for such payments is concluded.

        (8) The reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to this section shall be the actual demonstrated cost of such transportation of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section, or the miles of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section multiplied by $2.25 per loaded mile, whichever is less.

        (9) For each handler, the reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section for bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of payments received for such milk movements from the transportation credit balancing fund pursuant to § 1005.82.

        § 1005.61   Computation of uniform prices.

#### § § 1005.61

        On or before the 11th day of each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform butterfat price, a uniform skim milk price, and a uniform price for producer milk receipts reported for the prior month. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1005.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of these prices, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations.

        (a)  The uniform butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed by:

        (1) Multiplying the pounds of butterfat in producer milk allocated to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(b) by the respective class butterfat prices;

        (2) Adding the butterfat value calculated in § 1005.60(e) for other source milk allocated to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the steps of § 1000.44(b) that correspond to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and § 1000.44(a)(8) by the Class I price; and

        (3) Dividing the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

        (b)  The uniform skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

        (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1005.60 for all handlers;

        (2) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1005.75;

        (3) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (4) Subtract the value of the total pounds of butterfat for all handlers. The butterfat value shall be computed by multiplying the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the butterfat price computed in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (5) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (i) The total skim pounds of producer milk; and

        (ii) The total skim pounds for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1005.60(e); and

        (6) Subtract not less than 4 cents and not more than 5 cents.

        (c)  The uniform price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the sum of the following:

        (1) Multiply the uniform butterfat price for the month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section times 3.5 pounds of butterfat; and

        (2) Multiply the uniform skim milk price for the month pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section times 96.5 pounds of skim milk.

Payment shall be the amount, if any, by which the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (b) of this section:

        (a) The total value of milk of the handler for the month as determined pursuant to § 1005.60; and

        (b) The sum of the value at the uniform prices for skim milk and butterfat, adjusted for plant location, of the handler's receipts of producer milk; and the value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to § 1005.75, applicable at the location of the plant from which received of other source milk for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1005.60(e).

        § 1005.72   Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

#### § § 1005.72

        No later than one day after the date of payment receipt required under § 1005.71, the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to § 1005.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to § 1005.71(a). If, at such time, the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete the payments as soon as the funds are available.

        § 1005.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1005.73

        (a) Each handler that is not paying a cooperative association for producer milk shall pay each producer as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 23rd day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 26th day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than 90 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1005.75 and proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, a payment computed as follows shall be made so that it is received by each producer one day after the payment date required in § 1005.72:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer skim milk received times the uniform skim milk price for the month;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of butterfat received times the uniform butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received times the plant location adjustment pursuant to § 1005.75; and

        (iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) One day before partial and final payments are due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by 90 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1005.75.

        (2)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available for skim milk and butterfat at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment shall be the classified value of such milk as determined by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and butterfat assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44 by the class prices for the month at the receiving plant's location, and subtracting from this sum the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1005.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce payments pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but by not more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and the payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The month and dates that milk was received from the producer, including the daily and total pounds of milk received;

        (3) The total pounds of butterfat in the producer's milk;

        (4) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (5) The rate used in making payment if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        (6) The amount, or rate per hundredweight, and nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

        (7) The net amount of payment to the producer or cooperative association.

        § 1005.82   Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund.

#### § § 1005.82

        (a) Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund to handlers and cooperative associations requesting transportation credits shall be made as follows:

        (1) On or before the 13th day (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) after the end of each of the months of January and July through December and any other month in which transportation credits are in effect pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported pursuant to § 1005.30(a)(7), bulk milk transferred from a plant fully regulated under another Federal order as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that received, and reported pursuant to § 1005.30(a)(8), milk directly from producers' farms as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section to the extent that funds are available in the transportation credit balancing fund. If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall distribute the balance available in the transportation credit balancing fund by reducing payments prorata using the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due for the month. The amount of credits resulting from this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for transportation credits on or before the 20th day of the month following the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to § 1005.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary proration of transportation credit payments for the preceding month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Handlers will be promptly notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation and remedial payments to or from the transportation credit balancing fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following month.

        (3) Transportation credits paid pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market administrator pursuant to § 1000.77. Adjusted payments to or from the transportation credit balancing fund will remain subject to the final proration established pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator pursuant to § 1005.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the transportation credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.

        (b) The market administrator may extend the period during which transportation credits are in effect ( the transportation credit period) to the month of February or June if a written request to do so is received fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the month for which the request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, finds that such extension is necessary to assure the market of an adequate supply of milk for fluid use. Before making such a finding, the Market Administrator shall notify the Deputy Administrator of the Dairy Programs and all handlers in the market that an extension is being considered and invite written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to extend the transportation credit period must be issued in writing prior to the first day of the month for which the extension is to be effective.

        (c) Transportation credits shall apply to the following milk:

        (1) Bulk milk received at a pool distributing plant from a plant regulated under another Federal order, except Federal Order 1007; and

        (2) Bulk milk received directly from the farms of dairy farmers at pool distributing plants subject to the following conditions:

        (i) The dairy farmer was not a “producer” under this order for more than 45 days during the immediately preceding months of March through May, or not more than 50 percent of the production of the dairy farmer during those 3 months, in aggregate, was received as producer milk under this order during those 3 months; and

        (ii) The farm on which the milk was produced is not located within the specified marketing area of the order in this part or the marketing area of Federal Order 1007 (7 CFR part 1007).

        (iii) The market administrator may increase or decrease the milk production standard specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (d) Transportation credits shall be computed as follows:

        (1) The market administrator shall subtract from the pounds of milk described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section the pounds of bulk milk transferred from the pool plant receiving the supplemental milk if milk was transferred to a nonpool plant on the same calendar day that the supplemental milk was received. For this purpose, the transferred milk shall be subtracted from the most distant load of supplemental milk received, and then in sequence with the next most distant load until all of the transfers have been offset.

        (2) With respect to the pounds of milk described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that remain after the computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the shipping plant and the receiving plant;

        (ii) Multiply the number of miles so determined by the mileage rate for the month computed pursuant to § 1005.83(a)(6);

        (iii) Subtract the applicable Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) for the county in which the shipping plant is located from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving plant is located;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (3) For the remaining milk described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section after computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:

        (i) Determine an origination point for each load of milk by locating the nearest city to the last producer's farm from which milk was picked up for delivery to the receiving pool plant;

        (ii) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the receiving pool plant and the origination point;

        (iii) Subtract 15 percent (15%) of the miles from the mileage so determined;

        (iv) Multiply the remaining miles so computed by the mileage rate for the month computed pursuant to § 1005.83(a)(6);

        (v) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) applicable for the county in which the origination point is located from the Class I price applicable at the receiving pool plant's location;

        (vi) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section; and

        (vii) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (viii) The market administrator may revise the factor described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section (the mileage adjustment factor) if a written request to do so is received fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the month for which the request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing, efficient handling of milk in the marketing area, and an adequate supply of milk for fluid use. The market administrator may increase the mileage adjustment factor by as much as ten percentage points, up to twenty-five percent (25%) or decrease it by as much as ten percentage points, to a minimum of five percent (5%). Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall notify all handlers in the market that a revision is being considered and invite written data, comments, and arguments. Any decision to revise the mileage rate factor must be issued in writing prior to the first day of the month for which the revision is to be effective.

        (a)  The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund known as the Distributing Plant Delivery Credit Fund into which shall be deposited the payments made by handlers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and out of which shall be made the payments due handlers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Payments due a handler shall be offset against payments due from the handler.

        (b)  On or before the 12th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter), each handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in § 1000.9(c) of this chapter shall pay to the market administrator a distributing plant delivery credit fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to § 1005.44 by a per hundredweight assessment rate of $0.60 or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total distributing plant delivery credit disbursed during the prior calendar year. If the distributing plant delivery credit fund is in an overfunded position, the market administrator may completely waive the distributing plant delivery credit assessment for one or more months. In determining the distributing plant delivery credit assessment rate, in the event that during any month of that previous calendar year the fund balance was insufficient to cover the amount of credits that were due, the assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.

        (c)  The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the 23rd day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter), the assessment rate per hundredweight pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for the following month.

        (d)  Payments from the distributing plant delivery credit fund to handlers and cooperative associations requesting distributing plant delivery credits shall be made as follows:

        (1) On or before the 13th day (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) after the end of each month, the market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported pursuant to § 1005.30(a)(5), bulk unconcentrated milk directly from producers' farms, or receipts of bulk unconcentrated milk by transfer from a pool supply plant as defined in § 1005.7(c) or (d), a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section to the extent that funds are available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall distribute the balance available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund by reducing payments pro rata using the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due for the month. The credits resulting from this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for distributing plant delivery credits on or before the 20th day of the month following the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to § 1005.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary proration of distributing plant delivery credit payments for the preceding month pursuant to the process provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Handlers will be promptly notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation and remedial payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following month.

        (3) Distributing plant delivery credits paid pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market administrator pursuant to § 1000.77 of this chapter. Adjusted payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will remain subject to the final proration established pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator pursuant to § 1005.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the distributing plant delivery credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.

        (5) The market administrator shall provide monthly, to producers who are not members of a qualified cooperative association, a statement of the amount per hundredweight of distributing plant delivery credit which the distributing plant handler receiving their milk is entitled to claim.

        (e)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall apply to the following milk:

        (1) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk received directly from dairy farms at a pool distributing plant as producer milk subject to the following conditions:

        (iii) The market administrator may include additional counties from the states listed in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the request of a pool handler and provision of satisfactory proof that the county is a source of regular supply of milk to order distributing plants.

        (iv) Producer milk eligible for a payment under this section cannot be eligible for payment from the transportation credit balancing fund as specified in § 1005.82(c)(2).

        (v) The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as producer milk was received at such plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (2) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk transferred from a pool plant regulated pursuant to § 1005.7(c) or (d) to a pool distributing plant regulated pursuant to § 1005.7(a) or (b). The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as milk was received by transfer from a pool supply plant at such pool distributing plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (f)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall be computed as follows:

        (1) With respect to milk delivered directly from the farm to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the shipping farm's county seat and the receiving plant and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate of not greater than ninety-five percent (95%) and not less than seventy-five percent (75%);

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the county in which the shipping farm is located from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section by the monthly mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        (2) With respect to milk delivered from a pool supply plant to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the transferring pool plant and the receiving plant, and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate not greater than ninety-five percent (95%) and not less than seventy-five percent (75%);

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the transferring pool plant from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by the mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (g)  The monthly percentage rate adjustment within the range of permissible percentage adjustments provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined by the market administrator, and publicly announced prior to the month for which effective. In determining the percentage adjustment to the actual mileages of milk delivered from farms and milk transferred from pool plants the market administrator shall evaluate the general supply and demand for milk in the marketing area, any previous occurrences of sustained uneconomic movements of milk, and the balances in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. The adjustment percentage pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) of this section to the actual miles used for computing distributing plant delivery credits and announced by the market administrator shall always be the same percentage.

        (h)  The mileage rate for the distributing plant delivery credit fund shall be the mileage rate computed by the market administrator pursuant to § 1005.83.

        (i)  The market administrator shall regularly monitor and evaluate the requests for distributing plant delivery credits to determine that such credits are not encouraging uneconomic movements of milk, and that the credits continue to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. In making such determinations, the market administrator will include in the evaluation the general supply and demand for milk. If the market administrator finds that uneconomic movements are occurring, and such movements are persistent and pervasive, or are not being made in a way that assures orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area, after good cause shown, the market administrator may disallow the payments of distributing plant delivery credit on such milk. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall give the handler of such milk sufficient notice that an investigation is being considered and shall provide notice that the handler has the opportunity to explain why such movements were necessary, or the opportunity to correct such movements prior to the disallowance of any distributing plant delivery credits. Any disallowance of distributing plant delivery credit pursuant to this provision shall remain confidential between the market administrator and the handler.

#### § § 1006.7

        means a plant specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, a unit of plants as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, or a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (g) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ____.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 50 percent or more of the fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 50 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which 60 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received during the month from dairy farmers and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted from the plant, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) A plant located within the marketing area that is operated by a cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is requested for such plant by the cooperative association and during the month 60 percent of the producer milk of members of such cooperative association is delivered directly from farms to pool distributing plants or is transferred to such plants as a fluid milk product (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I) from the cooperative's plant.

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and that are located within the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process only Class I or Class II products and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (3) A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants from a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which it is to be effective.

        (f) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the date for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (g) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler plant;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is not located within any Federal order marketing area, meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is located in another Federal order marketing area, meets the pooling standards of the other Federal order, and has not had a majority of its route disposition in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or is locked into pool status under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area; and

        (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under such other order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or such plant has automatic pooling status under such other order.

        (h) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1006.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1006.7(a), (b), or (e);

        (b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

        (c) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

        (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a handler described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) In any month, not less than 10 days' production of the producer whose milk is diverted is physically received at a pool plant during the month;

        (2) The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month by a cooperative association shall not exceed 20 percent during the months of July through November, 25 percent during the months of December through February, and 40 percent during all other months, of the producer milk that the cooperative association caused to be delivered to, and physically received at, pool plants during the month;

        (3) The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a cooperative association that diverts milk during the month pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month shall not exceed 20 percent during the months of July through November, 25 percent during the months of December through February, and 40 percent during all other months, of the producer milk physically received at such plant (or such unit of plants in the case of plants that pool as a unit pursuant to § 1006.7(d)) during the month, excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c);

        § 1006.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1006.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (f) of this section. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to § 1000.44(c) of this chapter by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts; except that for the months of July 2018 through January 2019, the Class I skim milk price for this purpose shall be the Class I skim milk price as determined in § 1000.50(b) of this chapter plus $0.09 per hundredweight, and the Class I butterfat price for this purpose shall be the Class I butterfat price as determined in § 1000.50(c) of this chapter plus $0.0009 per pound. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein may be reduced by the market administrator for any month if the market administrator determines that the payments yet unpaid computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section will be less than the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein during the months of July 2018 through January 2019 shall be announced along with the prices announced in § 1000.53(b) of this chapter.

        (b) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;

        (c) Multiply the difference between the Class IV price for the preceding month and the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (d) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;

        (e) Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and

        (f) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        (g) For transactions occurring during the period of September 6, 2017, through September 15, 2017, for handlers who have submitted proof satisfactory to the market administrator no later than August 1, 2018, to determine eligibility for reimbursement of hurricane-imposed costs, subtract an amount equal to:

        (1) The additional cost of transportation on loads of milk rerouted from pool distributing plants to plants outside the state of Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma, and the additional cost of transportation on loads of milk moved and then dumped. The reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to this section shall be the actual demonstrated cost of such transportation of bulk milk or the miles of transportation on such loads of bulk milk multiplied by $3.75 per loaded mile, whichever is less;

        (2) The lost location value on loads of milk rerouted to plants outside the state of Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma. The lost location value shall be the difference per hundredweight between the value specified in § 1000.52 of this chapter, adjusted by § 1006.51(b), at the location of the plant where the milk would have normally been received and the value specified in § 1000.52, as adjusted by § 1005.51(b) and § 1007.51(b) of this chapter, at the location of the plant to which the milk was rerouted;

        (3) The value per hundredweight at the lowest classified price for the month of September 2017 for milk dumped at the farm and classified as other use milk pursuant to § 1000.40(e) of this chapter as a result of Hurricane Irma;

        (4) The value per hundredweight at the lowest classified price for the month of September 2017 for milk dumped from milk tankers after being moved off-farm and classified as other use milk pursuant to § 1000.40(e) of this chapter as a result of Hurricane Irma;

        (5) The value per hundredweight at the lowest classified price for the month of September 2017 for skim portion of milk dumped and classified as other use milk pursuant to § 1000.40(e) of this chapter as a result of Hurricane Irma; and

        (6) The difference between the announced class price applicable to the milk as classified by the market administrator for the month of September 2017 and the actual price received for milk delivered to nonpool plants outside the state of Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma.

        (h) The total amount of payment to all handlers under paragraph (g) of this section shall be limited for each month to an amount determined by multiplying the total Class I producer milk for all handlers pursuant to § 1000.44(c) of this chapter times $0.09 per hundredweight.

        (i) If the cost of payments computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section exceeds the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the market administrator shall prorate such payments to each handler based on each handler's proportion of transportation and other use milk costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6). Costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) which are not paid as a result of such a proration shall be paid in subsequent months until all costs incurred and documented through (g)(1) through (g)(6) have been paid.

        § 1006.61   Computation of uniform prices.

#### § § 1006.61

        On or before the 11th day of each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform butterfat price, a uniform skim milk price, and a uniform price for producer milk receipts reported for the prior month. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1006.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of these prices, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations.

        (a)  The uniform butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed by:

        (1) Multiplying the pounds of butterfat in producer milk allocated to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(b) by the respective class butterfat prices;

        (2) Adding the butterfat value calculated in § 1006.60(e) for other source milk allocated to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the steps of § 1000.44(b) that correspond to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and § 1000.44(a)(8) by the Class I price; and

        (3) Dividing the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

        (b)  The uniform skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

        (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1006.60 for all handlers;

        (2) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1006.75;

        (3) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (4) Subtract the value of the total pounds of butterfat for all handlers. The butterfat value shall be computed by multiplying the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the butterfat price computed in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (5) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (i) The total skim pounds of producer milk; and

        (ii) The total skim pounds for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1006.60(e); and

        (6) Subtract not less than 4 cents and not more than 5 cents.

        (c)  The uniform price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the sum of the following:

        (1) Multiply the uniform butterfat price for the month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section times 3.5 pounds of butterfat; and

        (2) Multiply the uniform skim milk price for the month pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section times 96.5 pounds of skim milk.

If, at such time, the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete the payments as soon as the funds are available.

        § 1006.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1006.73

        (a) Each handler that is not paying a cooperative association for producer milk shall pay each producer as follows:

        (1)  (i) For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 15th day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 20th day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than 85 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1006.75 and proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer; and

        (ii) For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the last day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 5th day of the following month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received from the 16th to the last day of the month at not less than 85 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1006.75 and proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, a payment computed as follows shall be made so that it is received by each producer one day after the payment date required in § 1006.72:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer skim milk received times the uniform skim milk price for the month;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of butterfat received times the uniform butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received times the plant location adjustment pursuant to § 1006.75; and

        (iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payments made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) One day before partial and final payments are due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by 90 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1006.75.

        (2)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available for skim milk and butterfat at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment shall be the classified value of such milk as determined by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and butterfat assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44 by the class prices for the month at the receiving plant's location, and subtracting from this sum the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1006.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce payments pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but by not more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and the payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The month and dates that milk was received from the producer, including the daily and total pounds of milk received;

        (3) The total pounds of butterfat in the producer's milk;

        (4) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (5) The rate used in making payment if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        (6) The amount, or rate per hundredweight, and nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

        (7) The net amount of payment to the producer or cooperative association.

Payments due a handler shall be offset against payments due from the handler.

        (b)  On or before the 12th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter), each handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in § 1000.9(c) of this chapter shall pay to the market administrator a distributing plant delivery credit fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to § 1006.44 by a per hundredweight assessment rate of $0.85 or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total distributing plant delivery credit disbursed during the prior calendar year. If the distributing plant delivery credit fund is in an overfunded position, the market administrator may completely waive the distributing plant delivery credit assessment for one or more months. In determining the distributing plant delivery credit assessment rate, in the event that during any month of that previous calendar year the fund balance was insufficient to cover the amount of credits that were due, the assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.

        (c)  The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the 23rd day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) the assessment rate per hundredweight pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for the following month.

        (d)  Payments from the distributing plant delivery credit fund to handlers and cooperative associations requesting distributing plant delivery credits shall be made as follows:

        (1) On or before the 13th day (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) after the end of each month, the market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported pursuant to § 1006.30(a)(5), bulk unconcentrated milk directly from producers' farms, or receipts of bulk unconcentrated milk by transfer from a pool supply plant as defined in § 1006.7(c) or (d), a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section to the extent that funds are available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall distribute the balance available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund by reducing payments pro rata using the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due for the month. The credits resulting from this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for distributing plant delivery credits on or before the 20th day of the month following the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to § 1006.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary proration of distributing plant delivery credit payments for the preceding month pursuant to the process provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Handlers will be promptly notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation and remedial payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following month.

        (3) Distributing plant delivery credits paid pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market administrator pursuant to § 1000.77 of this chapter. Adjusted payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will remain subject to the final proration established pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator pursuant to § 1006.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the distributing plant delivery credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.

        (5) The market administrator shall provide monthly, to producers who are not members of a qualified cooperative association, a statement of the amount per hundredweight of distributing plant delivery credit which the distributing plant handler receiving their milk is entitled to claim.

        (e)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall apply to the following milk:

        (1) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk received at a pool distributing plant as producer milk directly from dairy farms located within the marketing area; or located within the Georgia counties of Appling, Atkinson, Bacon, Baker, Ben Hill, Berrien, Brooks, Calhoun, Charlton, Chattahoochee, Clay, Clinch, Coffee, Cook, Colquitt, Crisp, Decatur, Dodge, Dooley, Dougherty, Early, Echols, Grady, Irwin, Lanier, Lee, Lowndes, Jeff Davis, Macon, Marion, Miller, Mitchell, Pierce, Pulaski, Quitman, Randolph, Schley, Seminole, Stewart, Sumter, Telfair, Terrel, Thomas, Tift, Turner, Ware, Webster, Wilcox, and Worth, and received at pool distributing plants. The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as producer milk was received at such plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (2) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk transferred from a pool plant regulated pursuant to § 1006.7(c) or (d) to a pool distributing plant regulated pursuant to § 1006.7(a) or (b). The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as milk was received by transfer from a pool supply plant at such pool distributing plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (f)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall be computed as follows:

        (1) With respect to milk delivered directly from the farm to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the shipping farm's county seat and the receiving plant and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate of not greater than ninety-five percent (95%) and not less than seventy-five percent (75%);

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the county in which the shipping farm is located from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in (f)(1)(i) of this section by the monthly mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(1(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;

        (2) With respect to milk delivered from a pool supply plant to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the transferring pool plant and the receiving plant, and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate of not greater than ninety-five percent (95%) and not less than seventy-five percent (75%);

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the transferring pool plant from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by the mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (g)  The monthly percentage rate adjustment within the range of permissible percentage adjustments provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined by the market administrator, and publicly announced prior to the month for which effective. In determining the percentage adjustment to the actual mileages of milk delivered from farms and milk transferred from pool plants the market administrator shall evaluate the general supply and demand for milk in the marketing area, any previous occurrences of sustained uneconomic movements of milk, and the balances in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. The adjustment percentage pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) to of this section the actual miles used for computing distributing plant credits and announced by the market administrator shall always be the same percentage.

        (h)  The market administrator shall compute a mileage rate factor each month as follows:

        (1) Compute the simple average rounded down to three decimal places for the most recent four (4) weeks of the Diesel Price per Gallon as reported by the Energy Information Administration of the United States Department of Energy for the Lower Atlantic and Gulf Coast Districts combined;

        (2) From the result in paragraph (h)(1) of this section subtract $2.26 per gallon;

        (3) Divide the result in paragraph (h)(2) of this section by 6.2, and round down to three decimal places to compute the fuel cost adjustment factor;

        (4) Add the result in paragraph (h)(3) of this section to $3.67;

        (5) Divide the result in paragraph (h)(4) of this section by 497;

        (6) Round the result in paragraph (h)(5) of this section down to five decimal places to compute the mileage rate.

        (i)  The market administrator shall regularly monitor and evaluate the requests for distributing plant delivery credits to determine that such credits are not encouraging uneconomic movements of milk, and the credits continue to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. In making such determinations the market administrator will include in the evaluation the general supply and demands for milk. If the market administrator finds that uneconomic movements are occurring, and such movements are persistent and pervasive, or are not being made in a way that assures orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area, after good cause shown, the market administrator may disallow the payments of distributing plant delivery credit on such milk. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall give the handler on such milk sufficient notice that an investigation is being considered and shall provide notice that the handler has the opportunity to explain why such movements were necessary, or the opportunity to correct such movements prior to the disallowance of any distributing plant delivery credits. Any disallowance of distributing plant delivery credit pursuant to this provision shall remain confidential between the market administrator and the handler.

The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ____.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 50 percent or more of the fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 50 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which 50 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received during the month from dairy farmers and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted from the plant, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) A plant located within the marketing area that is operated by a cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is requested for such plant by the cooperative association and during the month at least 60 percent of the producer milk of members of such cooperative association is delivered directly from farms to pool distributing plants or is transferred to such plants as a fluid milk product (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I) from the cooperative's plant.

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located within the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process only Class I or Class II products and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (f) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the date for which the requested revision is desired effective.

      Uniform Prices

        § 1007.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1007.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (f) of this section. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to § 1000.44(c) by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts; except that for the months of January 2005 through March 2005, the Class I skim milk price for this purpose shall be the Class I skim milk price as determined in § 1000.50(b) plus $0.04 per hundredweight, and the Class I butterfat price for this purpose shall be the Class I butterfat price as determined in § 1000.50(c) plus $0.0004 per pound. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein may be reduced by the market administrator for any month if the market administrator determines that the payments yet unpaid computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) and paragraph (g)(7) of this section will be less than the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein during the months of January 2005 through March 2005 shall be announced along with the prices announced in § 1000.53(b);

        (b) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;

        (c) Multiply the difference between the Class IV price for the preceding month and the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (d) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;

        (e) Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and

        (f) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        (g) For the months of January 2005 through March 2005 for handlers who have submitted proof satisfactory to the market administrator to determine eligibility for reimbursement of transportation costs, subtract an amount equal to:

        (1) The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (2) The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool supply plant that was then transferred to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (3) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from a pool supply plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;

        (4) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from another order plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne; and

        (5) The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk transferred or diverted to a plant regulated under another Federal order or to other nonpool plants which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.

        (6) The total amount of payment to all handlers under this section shall be limited for each month to an amount determined by multiplying the total Class I producer milk for all handlers pursuant to § 1000.44(c) times $0.04 per hundredweight.

        (7) If the cost of transportation computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section exceeds the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the market administrator shall prorate such payments to each handler based on each handler's proportion of transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section. Transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section which are not paid as a result of such a proration shall be included in each subsequent month's transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section until paid, or until the time period for such payments has concluded.

        (8) The reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to this section shall be the actual demonstrated cost of such transportation of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section, or the miles of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section multiplied by $2.25 per loaded mile, whichever is less.

        (9) For each handler, the reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section for bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of payments received for such milk movements from the transportation credit balancing fund pursuant to § 1007.82.

        § 1007.61   Computation of uniform prices.

#### § § 1007.61

        On or before the 11th day of each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform butterfat price, a uniform skim milk price, and a uniform price for producer milk receipts reported for the prior month. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1007.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of these prices, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations.

        (a)  The uniform butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed by:

        (1) Multiplying the pounds of butterfat in producer milk allocated to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(b) by the respective class butterfat prices;

        (2) Adding the butterfat value calculated in § 1007.60(e) for other source milk allocated to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the steps of § 1000.44(b) that correspond to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and § 1000.44(a)(8) by the Class I price; and

        (3) Dividing the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

        (b)  The uniform skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

        (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1007.60 for all handlers;

        (2) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1007.75;

        (3) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (4) Subtract the value of the total pounds of butterfat for all handlers. The butterfat value shall be computed by multiplying the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the butterfat price computed in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (5) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (i) The total skim pounds of producer milk; and

        (ii) The total skim pounds for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1007.60(e); and

        (6) Subtract not less than 4 cents and not more than 5 cents.

        (c)  The uniform price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the sum of the following:

        (1) Multiply the uniform butterfat price for the month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section times 3.5 pounds of butterfat; and

        (2) Multiply the uniform skim milk price for the month pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section times 96.5 pounds of skim milk.

#### § § 1007.72

        No later than one day after the date of payment receipt required under § 1007.71, the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to § 1007.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to § 1007.71(a). If, at such time, the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete the payments as soon as the funds are available.

        § 1007.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1007.73

        (a) Each handler that is not paying a cooperative association for producer milk shall pay each producer as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 23rd day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 26th day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than 90 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1007.75 and proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, a payment computed as follows shall be made so that it is received by each producer one day after the payment date required in § 1007.72:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer skim milk received times the uniform skim milk price for the month;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of butterfat received times the uniform butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received times the plant location adjustment pursuant to § 1007.75; and

        (iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) One day before partial and final payments are due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by 90 percent of the preceding month's uniform price, adjusted for plant location pursuant to § 1007.75.

        (2)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available for skim milk and butterfat at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment shall be the classified value of such milk as determined by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and butterfat assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44 by the class prices for the month at the receiving plant's location, and subtracting from this sum the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1007.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce payments pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but by not more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and the payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The month and dates that milk was received from the producer, including the daily and total pounds of milk received;

        § 1007.82   Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund.

#### § § 1007.82

        (a) Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund to handlers and cooperative associations requesting transportation credits shall be made as follows:

        (1) On or before the 13th day (except as provided in § 1000.90) after the end of each of the months of January, and July through December and any other month in which transportation credits are in effect pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported pursuant to § 1007.30(a)(7), bulk milk transferred from a plant fully regulated under another Federal order as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that received, and reported pursuant to § 1007.30(a)(8), milk directly from producers' farms as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section to the extent that funds are available in the transportation credit balancing fund.   If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall distribute the balance available in the transportation credit balancing fund by reducing payments pro rata using the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due for the month. The amount of credits resulting from this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for transportation credits on or before the 20th day of the month following the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to § 1007.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary proration of transportation credit payments for the preceding month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Handlers will be promptly notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation and remedial payments to or from the transportation credit balancing fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following month;

        (3) Transportation credits paid pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market administrator pursuant to § 1000.77. Adjusted payments to or from the transportation credit balancing fund will remain subject to the final proration established pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

        (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator pursuant to § 1007.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the transportation credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.

        (b) The market administrator may extend the period during which transportation credits are in effect ( the transportation credit period) to the month of February or June if a written request to do so is received fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the month for which the request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, finds that such extension is necessary to assure the market of an adequate supply of milk for fluid use. Any decision to extend the transportation credit period must be issued in writing prior to the first day of the month for which the extension is to be effective.

        (c) Transportation credits shall apply to the following milk:

        (1) Bulk milk received at a pool distributing plant from a plant regulated under another Federal order, except Federal Order 1005; and

        (2) Bulk milk received directly from the farms of dairy farmers at pool distributing plants subject to the following conditions:

        (i) The dairy farmer was not a “producer” under this order for more than 45 days during the immediately preceding months of March through May, or not more than 50 percent of the production of the dairy farmer during those 3 months, in aggregate, was received as producer milk under this order during those 3 months; and

        (ii) The farm on which the milk was produced is not located within the specified marketing area of the order in this part or the marketing area of Federal Order 1005 (7 CFR part 1005).

        (iii) The market administrator may increase or decrease the milk production standard specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (d) Transportation credits shall be computed as follows:

        (1) The market administrator shall subtract from the pounds of milk described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section the pounds of bulk milk transferred from the pool plant receiving the supplemental milk if milk was transferred to a nonpool plant on the same calendar day that the supplemental milk was received. For this purpose, the transferred milk shall be subtracted from the most distant load of supplemental milk received, and then in sequence with the next most distant load until all of the transfers have been offset;

        (2) With respect to the pounds of milk described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that remain after the computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the shipping plant and the receiving plant;

        (ii) Multiply the number of miles so determined by the mileage rate for the month computed pursuant to § 1007.83(a)(6);

        (iii) Subtract the applicable Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) for the county in which the shipping plant is located from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving plant is located;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (3) For the remaining milk described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section after computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:

        (i) Determine an origination point for each load of milk by locating the nearest city to the last producer's farm from which milk was picked up for delivery to the receiving pool plant;

        (ii) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the receiving pool plant and the origination point;

        (iii) Subtract 15 percent (15%) of the miles from the mileage so determined;

        (iv) Multiply the remaining miles so computed by the mileage rate for the month computed pursuant to § 1007.83(a)(6);

        (v) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) applicable for the county in which the origination point is located from the Class I price applicable at the receiving pool plant's location;

        (vi) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section; and

        (vii) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (viii) The market administrator may revise the factor described in (3)(iii) of this section (the mileage adjustment factor) if a written request to do so is received fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the month for which the request is made and, (15) days prior to the beginning of the month for which the request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing, efficient handling of milk in the marketing area, and an adequate supply of milk for fluid use. The market administrator may increase the mileage adjustment factor by as much as ten percentage points (10%) up to twenty-five percent (25%) or decrease it by as much as ten percentage points (10%), to a minimum of five percent (5%). Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall notify all handlers in the market that a revision is being considered and invite written data, comments, and arguments. Any decision to revise the mileage rate factor must be issued in writing prior to the first day of the month for which the revision is to be effective.

        § 1007.83   Mileage rate for the transportation credit balancing fund.

#### § § 1007.83

        (a) The market administrator shall compute the mileage rate each month as follows:

        (1) Compute the simple average rounded to three decimal places for the most recent 4 weeks of the Diesel Price per Gallon as reported by the Energy Information Administration of the United States Department of Energy for the Lower Atlantic and Gulf Coast Districts combined.

        (2) From the result in paragraph (a)(1) of this section subtract $2.26 per gallon;

        (3) Divide the result in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 6.2, and round down to three decimal places to compute the fuel cost adjustment factor;

        (4) Add the result in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to $3.67;

        (5) Divide the result in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 497;

        (6) Round the result in paragraph (a)(5) of this section down to five decimal places to compute the mileage rate.

        (b) The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the 23rd day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) the mileage rate pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section for the following month.

> [79 FR 25006, May 2, 2014; 79 FR 26591, May 9, 2014; 89 FR 6409, Feb. 1, 2024]

        § 1007.84   Distributing plant delivery credits.

#### § § 1007.84

        (a)  The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund known as the Distributing Plant Delivery Credit Fund into which shall be deposited the payments made by handlers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and out of which shall be made the payments due handlers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Payments due a handler shall be offset against payments due from the handler.

        (b)  On or before the 12th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter), each handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in § 1000.9(c) of this chapter shall pay to the market administrator a distributing plant delivery credit fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to § 1007.44 by a per hundredweight assessment rate of $0.50 or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total distributing plant delivery credit disbursed during the prior calendar year. If the distributing plant delivery credit fund is in an overfunded position, the market administrator may completely waive the distributing plant delivery credit assessment for one or more months. In determining the distributing plant delivery credit assessment rate, in the event that during any month of that previous calendar year the fund balance was insufficient to cover the amount of credits that were due, the assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.

        (c)  The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the 23rd day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter), the assessment rate per hundredweight pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for the following month.

        (d)  Payments from the distributing plant delivery credit fund to handlers and cooperative associations requesting distributing plant delivery credits shall be made as follows:

        (1) On or before the 13th day (except as provided in § 1000.90 of this chapter) after the end of each month, the market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported pursuant to § 1007.30(a)(5), bulk unconcentrated milk directly from producers' farms, or receipts of bulk unconcentrated milk by transfer from a pool supply plant as defined in § 1007.7(c) or (d), a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section to the extent that funds are available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall distribute the balance available in the distributing plant delivery credit fund by reducing payments pro rata using the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due for the month. The credits resulting from this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for distributing plant delivery credits on or before the 20th day of the month following the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to § 1007.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary proration of distributing plant delivery credit payments for the preceding month pursuant to the process provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Handlers will be promptly notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation and remedial payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following month.

        (3) Distributing plant delivery credits paid pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market administrator pursuant to § 1000.77 of this chapter. Adjusted payments to or from the distributing plant delivery credit fund will remain subject to the final proration established pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

        (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator pursuant to § 1007.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the distributing plant delivery credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.

        (5) The market administrator shall provide monthly to producers who are not members of a qualified cooperative association a statement of the amount per hundredweight of distributing plant delivery credit which the distributing plant handler receiving their milk is entitled to claim.

        (e)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall apply to the following milk:

        (1) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk received directly from dairy farms at a pool distributing plant as producer milk subject to the following conditions:

        (i) The farm on which the milk was produced is located within the specified marketing areas of the order in this part or the marketing area of Federal Order 1005 (7 CFR part 1005).

        (ii) The farm on which the milk was produced is located in the following counties in the State of:

        (A) Illinois: Alexander, Bond, Clay, Clinton, Crawford, Edwards, Effingham, Fayette, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Hardin, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Marion, Massac, Monroe, Montgomery, Perry, Pope, Pulaski, Randolph, Richland, St Clair, Saline, Union, Washington, Wayne, White, Williamson, Calhoun, Greene, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison, and Wabash.

        (C) Missouri: Audrain, Bates, Benton, Boone, Callaway, Camden, Cass, Clay, Cole, Cooper, Franklin, Gasconade, Henry, Hickory, Howard, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Lafayette, Lincoln, Maries, Miller, Moniteau, Montgomery, Morgan, Osage, Pettis, Phelps, Pike, Platte, Pulaski, Ray, St Charles, St Clair, Ste Genevieve, St Louis, St. Louis City, Saline, and Warren

        (D) Oklahoma: Adair, Atoka, Bryan, Cherokee, Choctaw, Coal, Craig, Creek, Delaware, Haskell, Hughes, Latimer, Le Flore, McCurtain, Mcintosh, Mayes, Muskogee, Nowata, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, Osage, Ottawa, Pawnee, Pittsburg, Pushmataha, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington

        (E) Texas: Anderson, Angelina, Bowie, Camp, Cass, Chambers, Cherokee, Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Galveston, Gregg, Hardin, Harris, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Houston, Hunt, Jasper, Jefferson, Kaufman, Lamar, Liberty, Marion, Montgomery, Morris, Nacogdoches, Newton, Orange, Panola, Polk, Rains, Red River, Rusk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Smith, Titus, Trinity, Tyler, Upshur, Van Zandt, Walker, and Wood.

        (iii) The Market Administrator may include additional counties from the states listed in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the request of a pool handler and provision of satisfactory proof that the county is a source of regular supply of milk to order distributing plants.

        (iv) Producer milk eligible for a payment under this section cannot be eligible for payment from the transportation credit balancing fund as specified in § 1007.82(c)(2).

        (v) The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as producer milk was received at such plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (2) Bulk unconcentrated fluid milk transferred from a pool supply plant regulated pursuant to § 1007.7(c) or (d) to a pool distributing plant regulated pursuant to § 1007.7(a) or (b). The quantity of milk described herein shall be reduced by the quantity of any bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred from a pool distributing plant to a nonpool plant or transferred to a pool supply plant on the same calendar day as milk was received by transfer from a pool supply plant at such pool distributing plant for which a distributing plant delivery credit is requested.

        (f)  Distributing plant delivery credits shall be computed as follows:

        (1) With respect to milk delivered directly from the farm to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the shipping farm's county seat and the receiving plant, and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate of not greater than ninety-five percent (95%) and not less than seventy-five percent (75%);

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the county in which the shipping farm is located from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in (f)(1)(i) of this section by the monthly mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;

        (2) With respect to milk delivered from a pool supply plant to a distributing plant:

        (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the transferring pool plant and the receiving plant, and multiply the miles by an adjustment rate of not greater than ninety-five (95%) percent and not less than seventy-five (75%) percent;

        (ii) Subtract the Class I price specified in § 1000.50(a) of this chapter for the transferring pool plant from the Class I price applicable for the county in which the receiving pool distributing plant is located;

        (iii) Multiply the adjusted miles so computed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by the mileage rate factor for the month computed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) Subtract any positive difference in Class I prices computed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section from the rate determined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section;

        (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;

        (g)  The monthly percentage rate adjustment within the range of permissible percentage adjustments provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined by the market administrator, and publicly announced prior to the month for which effective. In determining the percentage adjustment to the actual mileages of milk delivered from farms and milk transferred from pool plants the market administrator shall evaluate the general supply and demand for milk in the marketing area, any previous occurrences of sustained uneconomic movements of milk, and the balances in the distributing plant delivery credit fund. The adjustment percentage pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section to the actual miles used for computing distributing plant delivery credits and announced by the market administrator shall always be the same percentage.

        (h)  The mileage rate for the distributing plant delivery credit fund shall be the mileage rate computed by the market administrator pursuant to § 1007.83.

        (i)  The market administrator shall regularly monitor and evaluate the requests for distributing plant delivery credits to determine that such credits are not encouraging uneconomic movements of milk, and the credits continue to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. In making such determinations the market administrator will include in the evaluation the general supply and demand for milk. If the market administrator finds that uneconomic movements are occurring, and such movements are persistent and pervasive, or are not being made in a way that assures orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area, after good cause shown, the market administrator may disallow the payments of distributing plant delivery credit on such milk. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall give the handler on such milk sufficient notice that an investigation is being considered and shall provide notice that the handler has the opportunity to explain why such movements were necessary, or the opportunity to correct such movements prior to the disallowance of any distributing plant delivery credits. Any disallowance of distributing plant delivery credit pursuant to this provision shall remain confidential between the market administrator and the handler.

        (3) Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the supply plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1030.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1030.7(a), (b), or (e);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1030.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located in the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements of a pool distributing plant specified in paragraph (a) of this section and subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products; and

        (3) The operator of the unit has filed a written request with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month-to-month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.

        (f) A system of 2 or more supply plants operated by one or more handlers may qualify for pooling by meeting the shipping requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) Each plant in the system is located within the marketing area or was a pool supply plant pursuant to § 1030.7(c) for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the applicability date of this paragraph so long as it continues to maintain pool status. Cooperative associations may not use shipments pursuant to § 1000.9(c) to qualify plants located outside the marketing area;

        (2) The handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator on or before July 15 requesting that such plants qualify as a system for the period of August through July of the following year. Such request will contain a list of the plants participating in the system in the order, beginning with the last plant, in which the plants will be dropped from the system if the system fails to qualify. Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following July unless the handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator that the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any system for the remaining months through July. The handler(s) that established a system may add a plant operated by such handler(s) to a system if such plant has been a pool plant each of the 6 prior months and would otherwise be eligible to be in a system, upon written request to the market administrator no later than the 15th day of the prior month. In the event of an ownership change or the business failure of a handler that is a participant in a system, the system may be reorganized to reflect such changes if a written request to file a new marketing agreement is submitted to the market administrator; and

        (3) If a system fails to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph, the handler responsible for qualifying the system shall notify the market administrator which plant or plants will be deleted from the system so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a system. If the handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the system and continuing up the list as necessary until the deliveries are sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the system.

        (g) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section and § 1030.13(d)(2), and (d)(3) may be increased or decreased, for all or part of the marketing area, by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping or diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and

        (7) That portion of a regulated plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in advance and in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.

        (i) Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the immediately preceding 3 months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or the shipping percentages in paragraph (c) of this section that is unable to meet such performance standards for the current month because of unavoidable circumstances determined by the market administrator to be beyond the control of the handler operating the plant, such as a natural disaster (ice storm, wind storm, flood), fire, breakdown of equipment, or work stoppage, shall be considered to have met the minimum performance standards during the period of such unavoidable circumstances, but such relief shall not be granted for more than 2 consecutive months.

        (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least one day's production of such dairy farmer is physically received as producer milk at a pool plant during the first month the dairy farmer is a producer. If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval or as a result of the handler of the dairy farmer's milk failing to pool the milk under any order), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least one day's production of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant during the first month the dairy farmer is re-associated with the market;

        (2) The quantity of milk diverted by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) may not exceed 90 percent of the producer milk receipts reported by the handler pursuant to § 1030.30(c) provided that not less than 10 percent of such receipts are delivered to plants described in § 1030.7(c)(1)(i) through (iii).

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.

        (f) The quantity of milk reported by a handler pursuant to either § 1030.30(a)(1) or § 1030.30(c)(1) for April through February may not exceed 125 percent, and March may not exceed 135 percent of the producer milk receipts pooled by the handler during the prior month. Milk diverted to nonpool plants reported in excess of this limit shall be removed from the pool. Milk in excess of this limit received at pool plants, other than pool distributing plants, shall be classified pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(v) and § 1000.44(b). The handler must designate, by producer pick-up, which milk is to be removed from the pool. If the handler fails to provide this information, the market administrator will make the determination. The following provisions apply:

        (1) Milk shipped to and physically received at pool distributing plants in excess of the previous month's pooled volume shall not be subject to the 125 or 135 percent limitation;

        (2) Producer milk qualified pursuant to § __.13 of any other Federal Order and continuously pooled in any Federal Order for the previous six months shall not be included in the computation of the 125 or 135 percent limitation;

        (a) Each handler operating a pool distributing plant described in § 1030.7(a), (b), (d), or (e) that receives bulk milk from another pool plant shall receive a transportation credit for such milk computed as follows:

        (1) Determine the hundredweight of milk eligible for the credit by completing the steps in paragraph (c) of this section;

        (2) Multiply the hundredweight of milk eligible for the credit by .28 cents times the number of miles, not to exceed 400 miles, between the transferor plant and the transferee plant;

        (3) Subtract the effective Class I price at the transferor plant from the effective Class I price at the transferee plant;

        (4) Multiply any positive amount resulting from the subtraction in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the hundredweight of milk eligible for the credit; and

        (5) Subtract the amount computed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the amount computed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section exceeds the amount computed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the transportation credit shall be zero.

        (b) Each handler operating a pool distributing plant described in § 1030.7(a), (b), (d), or (e) that receives milk from dairy farmers, each handler that transfers or diverts bulk milk from a pool plant to a pool distributing plant, and each handler described in § 1000.9(c) that delivers producer milk to a pool distributing plant shall receive an assembly credit on the portion of such milk eligible for the credit pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The credit shall be computed by multiplying the hundredweight of milk eligible for the credit by $0.08.

        (c) The following procedure shall be used to determine the amount of milk eligible for transportation and assembly credits pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

        (1) At each pool distributing plant, determine the aggregate quantity of Class I milk, excluding beginning inventory of packaged fluid milk products;

        (2) Subtract the quantity of packaged fluid milk products received at the pool distributing plant from other pool plants and from nonpool plants if such receipts are assigned to Class I;

        (3) Subtract the quantity of bulk milk shipped from the pool distributing plant to other plants to the extent that such milk is classified as Class I milk;

        (4) Subtract the quantity of bulk milk received at the pool distributing plant from other order plants and unregulated supply plants that is assigned to Class I pursuant to §§ 1000.43(d) and 1000.44; and

        (5) Assign the remaining quantity pro rata to physical receipts during the month from:

        (i) Producers;

        (ii) Handlers described in § 1000.9(c); and

        (iii) Other pool plants.

        (d) For purposes of this section, the distances to be computed shall be determined by the market administrator using the shortest available state and/or Federal highway mileage. Mileage determinations are subject to redetermination at all times. In the event a handler requests a redetermination of the mileage pertaining to any plant, the market administrator shall notify the handler of such redetermination within 30 days after the receipt of such request. Any financial obligations resulting from a change in mileage shall not be retroactive for any periods prior to the redetermination by the market administrator.

      Producer Price Differential

        § 1030.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1030.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the values computed in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Class I value. (1) Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b) Class II value. (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c) Class III value. (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d) Class IV value. (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Compute an adjustment for the somatic cell content of producer milk by multiplying the values reported pursuant to § 1030.30(a)(1) and (c)(1) by the percentage of total producer milk allocated to Class II, Class III, and Class IV pursuant to § 1000.44(c);

        (f) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (g) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month and by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (i) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (j) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        (k) Compute the amount of credits applicable pursuant to § 1030.55.

        § 1030.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1030.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1030.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1030.30;

        (b) Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1030.60 by the protein price, other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively, and the total value of the somatic cell adjustment pursuant to § 1030.30(a)(1) and (c)(1);

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1030.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1030.60(i); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        (d) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1030.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata its payments to producers or to the cooperative association (with respect to receipts described in paragraph (b) of this section, prorating the underpayment to the volume of milk received from the cooperative association in proportion to the total milk received from producers by the handler), but not by more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (e) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant, as the case may be.

        (f) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in a form that may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products, and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (3) The operator of the unit has filed a written request with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month to month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.

        (f) A system of supply plants may qualify for pooling if 2 or more plants operated by one or more handlers meet the applicable percentage requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant, subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) Each plant in the system is located within the marketing area;

        (2) The handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator on or before September 1 requesting that such plants qualify as a system for the period of September through August of the following year. Such request will contain a list of the plants participating in the system;

        (3) Each plant included within a pool supply plant system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following August unless the handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator that the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any system for the remaining months through August. No plant may be added in any subsequent month through the following August to a system that qualifies in September; and

        (4) If a system fails to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph, the handler responsible for qualifying the system shall notify the market administrator which plant or plants will be deleted from the system so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a system. If the handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the system and continuing up the list as necessary until the deliveries are sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the system.

        (g) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section may be increased or decreased, for all or part of the marketing area, by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months. On the basis of a written application made by the plant operator at least 15 days prior to the date for which a determination of the market administrator is to be effective, the market administrator may determine that the route disposition in the respective marketing areas to be used for purposes of this paragraph shall exclude (for a specified period of time) route disposition made under limited term contracts to governmental bases and institutions;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and

        (7) That portion of a regulated plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a plant must be requested in advance and in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator. Such nonpool status shall be effective on the first day of the month following approval of the request by the market administrator and thereafter for the longer of twelve (12) consecutive months or until notification of the desire to requalify as a pool plant, in writing, is received by the market administrator. Requalification will require deliveries to a pool distributing plant(s) as provided for in § 1032.7(c). For requalification, handlers may not use milk delivered directly from producer's farms pursuant to § 1000.9(c) or § 1032.13(c) for the first month.

        (i) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1032.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1032.7(a), (b), or (e);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1032.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (b) Receives fluid milk from own farm production or milk that is fully subject to the pricing and pooling provisions of the order in this part or any other Federal order;

        (c) Receives at its plant or acquires for route disposition no more than 150,000 pounds of fluid milk products from handlers fully regulated under any Federal order. This limitation shall not apply if the producer-handler's own farm production is less than 150,000 pounds during the month;

        (d) Disposes of no other source milk as Class I milk except by increasing the nonfat milk solids content of the fluid milk products; and

        (e) Provides proof satisfactory to the market administrator that the care and management of the dairy animals and other resources necessary to produce all Class I milk handled (excluding receipts from handlers fully regulated under any Federal order) and the processing and packaging operations are the producer-handler's own enterprise and at its own risk.

        (f) Any producer-handler with Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter shall be subject to payments into the Order 1131 producer settlement fund on such dispositions pursuant to § 1000.76(a) and payments into the Order 1131 administrative fund provided such dispositions are less than three million pounds in the current month and such producer-handler had total Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products from own farm production of three million pounds or more the previous month. If the producer-handler has Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products into the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter of three million pounds or more during the current month, such producer-handler shall be subject to the provisions described in § 1131.7 of this chapter or 1000.76(a).

        (1) Received at a pool plant directly from the producer or diverted by the plant operator in accordance with § 1032.13; or (2) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c).

        (b) Producer shall not include:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined in any Federal order;

        (2) A dairy farmer whose milk is received at an exempt plant, excluding producer milk diverted to the exempt plant pursuant to § 1032.13(d);

        (3) A dairy farmer whose milk is received by diversion at a pool plant from a handler regulated under another Federal order if the other Federal order designates the dairy farmer as a producer under that order and that milk is allocated by request to a utilization other than Class I; and

        (4) A dairy farmer whose milk is reported as diverted to a plant fully regulated under another Federal order with respect to that portion of the milk so diverted that is assigned to Class I under the provisions of such other order.

        § 1032.13   Producer milk.

#### § § 1032.13

        means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk), including nonfat components, and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:

        (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;

        (b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

        (c) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

        (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of such dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant and the dairy farmer has continuously retained producer status since that time. If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant;

        (2) The equivalent of at least one day's milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of January and February, and August through November;

        (3) The equivalent of at least one day's milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of March through July and December if the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section (§ 1032.13) in each of the prior months of August through November and January through February are not met, except in the case of a dairy farmer who marketed no Grade A milk during each of the prior months of August through November or January through February.

        (4) Of the quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversions, but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c)) the handler diverts to nonpool plants not more than 75 percent during the months of August through February, and not more than 80 percent during the months of March through July, provided that not less than 25 percent of such receipts in the months of August through February and 20 percent of the remaining months' receipts are delivered to plants described in § 1032.7(a), (b), or (i).;

        (5) Receipts used in determining qualifying percentages shall be milk transferred to or diverted to or physically received by a plant described in § 1032.7(a), (b) or (i) less any transfer or diversion of bulk fluid milk products from such plants;

        (6) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;

        (7) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk; and

        (8) The applicable diversion limits in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.

        (f) The quantity of milk reported by a handler pursuant to § 1032.30(a)(1) and/or § 1032.30(c)(1) for the current month may not exceed 125 percent of the producer milk receipts pooled by the handler during the prior month. Milk diverted to nonpool plants reported in excess of this limit shall be removed from the pool. Milk received at pool plants in excess of the 125 percent limit, other than pool distributing plants, shall be classified pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(v). The handler must designate, by producer pick-up, which milk is to be removed from the pool. If the handler fails to provide this information the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section shall apply. The following provisions apply:

        (1) Milk shipped to and physically received at pool distributing plants shall not be subject to the 125 percent limitation;

        (2) Producer milk qualified pursuant to § __.13 of any other Federal Order in the previous month shall not be included in the computation of the 125 percent limitation; provided that the producers comprising the milk supply have been continuously pooled on any Federal Order for the entirety of the most recent three consecutive months.

        (3) The market administrator may waive the 125 percent limitation:

        (i) For a new handler on the order, subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or

        (ii) For an existing handler with significantly changed milk supply conditions due to unusual circumstances;

        (4) A bloc of milk may be considered ineligible for pooling if the market administrator determines that handlers altered the reporting of such milk for the purpose of evading the provisions of this paragraph.

        § 1032.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1032.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a)  (1) Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b)  (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c)  (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d)  (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Compute an adjustment for the somatic cell content of producer milk by multiplying the values reported pursuant to § 1032.30(a)(1) and (c)(1) by the percentage of total producer milk allocated to Class II, Class III, and Class IV pursuant to § 1000.44(c);

        (f) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (g) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (i) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (j) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1032.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1032.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1032.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1032.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1032.30;

        (b) Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1032.60 by the protein price, the other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively, and the total value of the somatic cell adjustment pursuant to § 1032.30(a)(1) and (c)(1);

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1032.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1032.60(i); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        § 1033.7   Pool plant.

#### § § 1033.7

        means a plant, unit of plants, or system of plants as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, or a plant specified in paragraph (j) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § __.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 30 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area. Plants located within the marketing area that meet the 30 percent route disposition standard contained above, and have combined route disposition and transfers of at least 50 percent into Federal order marketing areas will be regulated as a distributing plant in this order.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 30 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which the quantity of bulk fluid milk products shipped to, received at, and physically unloaded into plants described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as a percent of the Grade A milk received at the plant from dairy farmers (except dairy farmers described in § 1033.12(b)) and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), as reported in § 1033.30(a), is not less than 40 percent of the milk received from dairy farmers, including milk diverted pursuant to § 1033.13, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Qualifying shipments pursuant to this paragraph may be made to the following plants, except whenever the authority provided in paragraph (g) of this section is applied to increase the shipping requirements specified in this section, only shipments to pool plants described in § 1033.7(a) and (b), shall count as qualifying shipments for the purpose of meeting the increased shipments:

        (i) Pool plants described in § 1033.7(a) and (b);

        (ii) Plants of producer-handlers;

        (iii) Partially regulated distributing plants, except that credit for such shipments shall be limited to the amount of such milk classified as Class I at the transferee plant.

        (2) The operator of a supply plant located within the marketing area may include deliveries to pool distributing plants directly from farms of producers pursuant to § 1033.13(c) as up to 90 percent of the supply plant's qualifying shipments. Handlers may not use shipments pursuant to § 1033.13(c) to qualify plants located outside the marketing area.

        (3) Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the supply plant's shipping percentage.

        (4) Shipments used in determining qualifying percentages shall be milk transferred or diverted and physically received by pool distributing plants, less any transfers or diversions of bulk fluid milk products from such pool distributing plants.

        (5) A supply plant that does not meet the minimum delivery requirements specified in this paragraph to qualify for pool status in the current month because a distributing plant to which the supply plant delivered its fluid milk products during such month failed to qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall continue to be a pool plant for the current month if such supply plant qualified as a pool plant in the 3 immediately preceding months.

        (d) A plant located in the marketing area and operated by a cooperative association if, during the months of December through July 30 percent, during the month of August 35 percent and during the months of September through November 40 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the association is delivered to a distributing pool plant(s) or to a nonpool plant(s) and classified as Class I. Deliveries for qualification purposes may be made directly from the farm or by transfer from such association's plant, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The cooperative requests pool status for such plant;

        (2) The 30 percent delivery requirement for the months of December through July may be met for the current month or it may be met on the basis of deliveries during the preceding 12-month period ending with the current month.

        (3) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory authority to handle milk for fluid consumption; and

        (4) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section or under the similar provisions of another Federal order applicable to a distributing plant or supply plant.

        (e) A plant located inside the marketing area which has been a pool plant under this order for twelve consecutive months, but is not otherwise qualified under this paragraph, if it has a marketing agreement with a cooperative association and it fulfills the following conditions:

        (1) The aggregate monthly quantity supplied by all parties to such an agreement as a percentage of the producer milk receipts included in the unit during the months of August through November is not less than 45 percent and during the months of December through July is not less than 35 percent;

        (2) Shipments for qualification purposes shall include both transfers from supply plants to plants described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and deliveries made direct from the farm to plants qualified under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (f) A system of supply plants may qualify for pooling if 2 or more plants operated by one or more handlers meet the applicable percentage requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) Each plant in the system is located within the marketing area, or was a pool supply plant for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the effective date of this paragraph so long as it continues to maintain pool status. Cooperative associations may not use shipments pursuant to § 1033.9(c) to qualify plants located outside the marketing area;

        (2) A written notification to the market administrator listing the plants to be included in the system and the handler that is responsible for meeting the performance requirements of this paragraph under a marketing agreement certified to the market administrator by the designated handler and any others included in the system, and the period during which such consideration shall apply. Such notice, and notice of any change in designation, shall be furnished on or before the 5th working day following the month to which the notice applies. The listed plants included in the system shall also be in the sequence in which they shall qualify for pool plant status based on the minimum deliveries required. If the deliveries made are insufficient to qualify the entire system for pooling, the last listed plant shall be excluded from the system, followed by the plant next-to-last on the list, and continuing in this sequence until remaining listed plants have met the minimum shipping requirements; and

        (3) Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system unless the plant subsequently fails to qualify for pooling, or the responsible handler submits a written notification to the market administrator prior to the first day of the month that the plant is to be deleted from the system, or that the system is to be discontinued. In any month of March through August, a system shall not contain any plant which was not qualified under this paragraph, either individually or as a member of a system, during the previous September through February.

        (g) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section that also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order.

        (i) Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the immediately preceding 3 months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or the shipping percentages in paragraph (c) of this section that is unable to meet such performance standards for the current month because of unavoidable circumstances determined by the market administrator to be beyond the control of the handler operating the plant, such as a natural disaster (ice storm, wind storm, flood), fire, breakdown of equipment, or work stoppage, shall be considered to have met the minimum performance standards during the period of such unavoidable circumstances, but such relief shall not be granted for more than 2 consecutive months.

        (j) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1033.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1033.7(a) or (b);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1033.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section,  means any person who produces milk approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for fluid consumption as Grade A milk and whose milk is:

        (1) Received at a pool plant directly from the producer or diverted by the plant operator in accordance with § 1033.13; or

        (2) Received by a handler described in § 1033.9(c).

        (b) Producer shall not include:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined in any Federal order;

        (2) A dairy farmer whose milk is received at an exempt plant, excluding producer milk diverted to the exempt plant pursuant to § 1033.13(d);

        (3) A dairy farmer whose milk is received by diversion at a pool plant from a handler regulated under another Federal order if the other Federal order designates the dairy farmer as a producer under that order and that milk is allocated by request to a utilization other than Class I; and

        (4) A dairy farmer whose milk is reported as diverted to a plant fully regulated under another Federal order with respect to that portion of the milk so diverted that is assigned to Class I under the provisions of such other order.

        § 1033.13   Producer milk.

#### § § 1033.13

        means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk), including nonfat components, and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:

        (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;

        (b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

        (c) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

        (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of such dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant and the dairy farmer has continuously retained producer status since that time. If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant;

        (2) The equivalent of at least two days' milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of August through November;

        (3) The equivalent of at least two days' milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of December through July if the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section (§ 1033.13) in each of the prior months of August through November are not met, except in the case of a dairy farmer who marketed no Grade A milk during each of the prior months of August through November.

        (4) Of the total quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversions but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c) or which is diverted to another pool plant), the handler diverted to nonpool plants not more than 50 percent in each of the months of August through February and 60 percent in each of the months of March through July.

        (5) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;

        (6) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be producer milk. The diverting handler shall designate the dairy farmer deliveries that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to designate the dairy farmer deliveries which are ineligible, producer milk status shall be forfeited with respect to all milk diverted to nonpool plants by such handler; and

        (7) The delivery day requirement in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section and the diversion percentages in paragraph (d)(4) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that suhc revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan imposed under the authority of another government entity.

        (f) Producer milk of a handler shall not exceed the limits as established in § 1033.13(f)(1) through § 1033.13(f)(3).

        (1) Producer milk for the months of April through February may not exceed 115 percent of the producer milk receipts of the prior month. Producer milk for March may not exceed 120 percent of producer receipts of the prior month; plus

        (2) Milk shipped to and physically received at pool distributing plants and allocated to Class I use in excess of the volume allocated to Class I in the prior month; plus

        (3) If a producer did not have any milk delivered to any plant as other than producer milk as defined under the order in this part or any other Federal milk order for the preceding three months; and the producer had milk qualified as producer milk on any other Federal order in the previous month, add the lesser of the following:

        (i) Any positive difference of the volume of milk qualified as producer milk on any other Federal order in the previous month, less the volume of milk qualified as producer milk on any other Federal order in the current month, or

        (ii) Any positive difference of the volume of milk qualified as producer milk under the order in this part in the current month, less the volume of milk qualified as producer milk under the order in this part in the previous month.

        (4) Milk received at pool plants in excess of these limits shall be classified pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(v) and § 1000.44(b). Milk diverted to nonpool plants reported in excess of this limit shall not be producer milk. The handler must designate, by producer pick-up, which milk shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to provide this information the provisions of § 1033.13(d)(6) shall apply.

        (5) The market administrator may waive these limitations:

        (i) For a new handler on the order, subject to the provisions of § 1033.13(f)(6), or

        (ii) For an existing handler with significantly changed milk supply conditions due to unusual circumstances;

        (6) Milk may not be considered producer milk if the market administrator determines that handlers altered the reporting of such milk for the purpose of evading the provisions of this paragraph.

        § 1033.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1033.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Class I value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b) Class II value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c) Class III value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d) Class IV value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Compute an adjustment for the somatic cell content of producer milk by multiplying the values reported pursuant to § 033.30(a)(1) and (c)(1) by the percentage of total producer milk allocated to Class II, Class III, and Class IV pursuant to § 1000.44(c);

        (f) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (g) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (i) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (j) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1033.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1033.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1033.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1033.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1033.30;

        (b) Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1033.60 by the protein price, the other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively, and the total value of the somatic cell adjustment pursuant to § 1033.30(a)(1) and (c)(1);

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1033.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1033.60(i); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        (iv) The pounds of other solids received times the other solids price for the month;

        (v) The hundredweight of milk received times the somatic cell adjustment for the month;

        (vi) Less any payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (vii) Less proper deductions authorized in writing by such producer and plus or minus adjustments for errors in previous payments to such producer; and

        (viii) Less deductions for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86.

        (b)  On or before the day prior to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section (except as provided in § 1000.90), each handler shall pay to a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk fluid milk/skimmed milk received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by the lowest announced class price for the preceding month.

        (2)  For bulk fluid milk/skimmed milk products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  Following the classification of bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment for such receipts shall be determined as follows:

        (i) The hundredweight of Class I skim milk times the Class I skim milk price for the month plus the pounds of Class I butterfat times the Class I butterfat price for the month. The Class I prices to be used shall be the prices effective at the location of the receiving plant;

        (ii) The pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price;

        (iii) The pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price;

        (v) The pounds of butterfat in Class III and Class IV milk times the butterfat price;

        (vi) The pounds of protein in Class III milk times the protein price;

        (vii) The pounds of other solids in Class III milk times the other solids price;

        (viii) The hundredweight of Class II, Class III, and Class IV milk times the somatic cell adjustment; and

        (ix) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section and from that sum deduct any payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1033.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce payments pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but not by more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant, as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in a form that may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The daily and total pounds, and the month and dates such milk was received from that producer;

        (3) The total pounds of butterfat, protein, and other solids contained in the producer's milk;

        (4) The somatic cell count of the producer's milk;

        (5) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (6) The rate used in making payment if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        (7) The amount, or rate per hundredweight, or rate per pound of component, and the nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

#### § § 1051.7

        means a plant, unit of plants, or system of plants as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ______.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which the quantity of bulk fluid milk products shipped to (and physically unloaded into) plants described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not less than 10 percent of the Grade A milk received from dairy farmers (except dairy farmers described in § 1051.12(b)) and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk diverted pursuant to § 1051.13, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Qualifying shipments may be made to plants described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, except that whenever shipping requirements are increased pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, only shipments to pool plants described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall count as qualifying shipments for the purpose of meeting the increased shipments:

        (i) Pool plants described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section;

        (ii) Plants of producer-handlers;

        (iii) Partially regulated distributing plants, except that credit for such shipments shall be limited to the amount of such milk classified as Class I at the transferee plant; and

        (iv) Distributing plants fully regulated under other Federal orders, except that credit for shipments to such plants shall be limited to the quantity shipped to (and physically unloaded into) pool distributing plants during the month and credits for shipments to other order plants shall not include any such shipments made on the basis of agreed-upon Class II, Class III, or Class IV utilization.

        (2) Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the supply plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located in the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements of a pool distributing plant specified in paragraph (a) of this section and subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products; and

        (3) The operator of the unit has filed a written request with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month-to-month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.

        (e) A system of two or more supply plants operated by one or more handlers may qualify for pooling by meeting the shipping requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) Each plant in the system is located within the marketing area. Cooperative associations or other handlers may not use shipments pursuant to § 1000.9(c) to qualify supply plants located outside the marketing area;

        (2) The handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator on or before July 15 requesting that such plants qualify as a system for the period of August through July of the following year. Such request will contain a list of the plants participating in the system in the order, beginning with the last plant, in which the plants will be dropped from the system if the system fails to qualify. Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following July unless the handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator that the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any system for the remaining months through July. The handler(s) that have established a system may add a plant operated by such handler(s) to a system if such plant has been a pool plant each of the 6 prior months and would otherwise be eligible to be in a system, upon written request to the market administrator no later than the 15th day of the prior month. In the event of an ownership change or the business failure of a handler who is a participant in a system, the system may be reorganized to reflect such changes if a written request to file a new marketing agreement is submitted to the market administrator; and

        (3) If a system fails to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph (e), the handler responsible for qualifying the system shall notify the market administrator which plant or plants will be deleted from the system so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a system. If the handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the system and continuing up the list as necessary until the deliveries are sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the system.

        (f) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described in § 1051.2:

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk, provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in paragraph (a), (b), or (e) of this section;

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1051.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (g) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section and § 1051.13(d)(2) and (3) may be increased or decreased, for all or part of the marketing area, by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping or diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route disposition in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months, or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and

        (7) That portion of a regulated plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in advance and in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.

        (i) Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the immediately preceding 3 months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or the shipping percentages in paragraph (c) of this section that is unable to meet such performance standards for the current month because of unavoidable circumstances determined by the market administrator to be beyond the control of the handler operating the plant, such as a natural disaster (ice storm, wind storm, flood, fire, earthquake, breakdown of equipment, or work stoppage, shall be considered to have met the minimum performance standards during the period of such unavoidable circumstances, but such relief shall not be granted for more than 2 consecutive months.

        means a person who operates a dairy farm and a distributing plant from which there is route disposition in the marketing area, from which total route disposition and packaged sales of fluid milk products to other plants during the month does not exceed 3 million pounds, and who the market administrator has designated a producer-handler after determining that all of the requirements of this section have been met.

        (a)  Designation of any person as a producer-handler by the market administrator shall be contingent upon meeting the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. Following the cancellation of a previous producer-handler designation, a person seeking to have their producer-handler designation reinstated must demonstrate that these conditions have been met for the preceding month:

        (1) The care and management of the dairy animals and the other resources and facilities designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section necessary to produce all Class I milk handled (excluding receipts from handlers fully regulated under any Federal order) are under the complete and exclusive control, ownership, and management of the producer-handler and are operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and at its sole risk.

        (2) The plant operation designated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section at which the producer-handler processes and packages, and from which it distributes, its own milk production is under the complete and exclusive control, ownership, and management of the producer-handler and is operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and at its sole risk.

        (3) The producer-handler neither receives at its designated milk production resources and facilities nor receives, handles, processes, or distributes at or through any of its designated milk handling, processing, or distributing resources and facilities other source milk products for reconstitution into fluid milk products or fluid milk products derived from any source other than:

        (i) Its designated milk production resources and facilities (own farm production);

        (ii) Pool handlers and plants regulated under any Federal order within the limitation specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or

        (5) No milk produced by the herd(s) or on the farm(s) that supplies milk to the producer-handler's plant operation is:

        (i) Subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns; or

        (ii) Marketed in any part as Class I milk to the non-pool distributing plant of any other handler.

        (b)  Designation of a person as a producer-handler shall include the determination of what shall constitute milk production, handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities, all of which shall be considered an integrated operation, under the sole and exclusive ownership of the producer-handler.

        (1) Milk production resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (milking herd(s), buildings housing such herd(s), and the land on which such buildings are located) used for the production of milk which are solely owned, operated, and which the producer-handler has designated as a source of milk supply for the producer-handler's plant operation. However, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), any such milk production resources and facilities which do not constitute an actual or potential source of milk supply for the producer-handler's operation shall not be considered a part of the producer-handler's milk production resources and facilities.

        (2) Milk handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (including store outlets) used for handling, processing, and distributing fluid milk products which are solely owned by, and directly operated or controlled by the producer-handler or in which the producer-handler in any way has an interest, including any contractual arrangement, or over which the producer-handler directly or indirectly exercises any degree of management control.

        (3) All designations shall remain in effect until canceled pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  The designation as a producer-handler shall be canceled upon determination by the market administrator that any of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section are not continuing to be met, or under any of the conditions described in paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Cancellation of a producer-handler's status pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the requirements were not met or the conditions for cancellation occurred.

        (2) The producer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from sources other than the milk production facilities and resources designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that it may receive at its plant, or acquire for route disposition, fluid milk products from fully regulated plants and handlers under any Federal order if such receipts do not exceed 150,000 pounds monthly. This limitation shall not apply if the producer-handler's own-farm production is less than 150,000 pounds during the month.

        (3) Milk from the milk production resources and facilities of the producer-handler is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan operating under the authority of a State government.

        (d)  The market administrator shall publicly announce:

        (1) The name, plant location(s), and farm location(s) of persons designated as producer-handlers;

        (2) The names of those persons whose designations have been cancelled; and

        (3) The effective dates of producer-handler status or loss of producer-handler status for each. Such announcements shall be controlling with respect to the accounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from any producer-handler.

        (e)  The burden rests upon the handler who is designated as a producer-handler to establish through records required pursuant to § 1000.27 that the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section have been and are continuing to be met, and that the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for cancellation of the designation do not exist.

        (f)  Any producer-handler with Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter shall be subject to payments into the Order 1131 producer settlement fund on such dispositions pursuant to § 1000.76(a) and payments into the Order 1131 administrative fund, provided such dispositions are less than three million pounds in the current month and such producer-handler had total Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products from own farm production of three million pounds or more the previous month. If the producer-handler has Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products into the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter of three million pounds or more during the current month, such producer-handler shall be subject to the provisions described in § 1131.7 of this chapter or § 1000.76(a).

If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval or as a result of the handler of the dairy farmer's milk failing to pool the milk under any order), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least one day's production of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant during the first month the dairy farmer is re-associated with the market;

        (2) The quantity of milk diverted by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) may not exceed 90 percent of the producer milk receipts reported by the handler pursuant to § 1051.30(c) provided that not less than 10 percent of such receipts are delivered to plants described in § 1051.7(c)(1)(i) through (iii). These percentages are subject to any adjustments that may be made pursuant to § 1051.7(g); and

        (3) The quantity of milk diverted to nonpool plants by the operator of a pool plant described in § 1051.7(a), (b) or (d) may not exceed 90 percent of the Grade A milk received from dairy farmers (except dairy farmers described in § 1051.12(b)) including milk diverted pursuant to this section. These percentages are subject to any adjustments that may be made pursuant to § 1051.7(g).

        (4) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.

        (f) The quantity of milk reported by a handler pursuant to either § 1051.30(a)(1) or (c)(1) for April through February may not exceed 125 percent, and for March may not exceed 135 percent, of the producer milk receipts pooled by the handler during the prior month. Milk diverted to nonpool plants reported in excess of this limit shall be removed from the pool. Milk in excess of this limit received at pool plants, other than pool distributing plants, shall be classified pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(v) and (b). The handler must designate, by producer pick-up, which milk is to be removed from the pool. If the handler fails to provide this information, the market administrator will make the determination. The following provisions apply:

        (1) Milk shipped to and physically received at pool distributing plants in excess of the previous month's pooled volume shall not be subject to the 125 or 135 percent limitation;

        (2) Producer milk qualified pursuant to § ______.13 of any other Federal Order and continuously pooled in any Federal Order for the previous six months shall not be included in the computation of the 125 or 135 percent limitation;

        (3) The market administrator may waive the 125 or 135 percent limitation:

        (i) For a new handler on the order, subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section; or

        (ii) For an existing handler with significantly changed milk supply conditions due to unusual circumstances; and

        (4) A bloc of milk may be considered ineligible for pooling if the market administrator determines that handlers altered the reporting of such milk for the purpose of evading the provisions of this paragraph (f).

      Producer Price Differential

        § 1051.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1051.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the values computed in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a)  (1) Multiply the hundredweight of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price; and

        (b)  (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c)  (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d)  (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e)  Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (f)  Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month and by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b).

        (g)  Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (h)  Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to §§ 1000.43(d) and 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (i)  For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1051.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1051.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1051.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this introductory text, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1051.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1051.30;

        (b) Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1051.60 by the protein price, other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively;

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1051.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1051.60(i); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        § 1051.62   Announcement of producer prices.

#### § § 1051.62

        On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, the market administrator shall announce publicly the following prices and information:

        (a) The producer price differential;

        (b) The protein price;

        (c) The nonfat solids price;

        (d) The other solids price;

        (e) The butterfat price;

        (f) The average butterfat, nonfat solids, protein and other solids content of producer milk; and

        (g) The statistical uniform price for milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat, computed by combining the Class III price and the producer price differential.

Payment shall be the amount, if any, by which the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (b) of this section:

        (a) The total value of milk to the handler for the month as determined pursuant to § 1051.60.

        (b) The sum of:

        (1) An amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of producer milk as determined pursuant to § 1000.44(c) by the producer price differential as adjusted pursuant to § 1051.75;

        (2) An amount obtained by multiplying the total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in producer milk by the protein, other solids, and butterfat prices respectively; and

        (3) An amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and butterfat for which a value was computed pursuant to § 1051.60(i) by the producer price differential as adjusted pursuant to § 1051.75 for the location of the plant from which received.

        § 1051.72   Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

#### § § 1051.72

        No later than the 18th day after the end of each month (except as provided in § 1000.90), the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to § 1051.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to § 1051.71(a). If, at such time, the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete the payments as soon as the funds are available.

        § 1051.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1051.73

        (a)  Each handler shall pay each producer for producer milk for which payment is not made to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the date of this partial payment, payment shall be made so that it is received by each producer on or before the last day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month from the producer at not less than the lowest announced class price for the preceding month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by each producer no later than the 19th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) in an amount not less than the sum of:

        (i) The hundredweight of producer milk received times the producer price differential for the month as adjusted pursuant to § 1051.75;

        (ii) The pounds of butterfat received times the butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) The pounds of protein received times the protein price for the month;

        (iv) The pounds of other solids received times the other solids price for the month;

        (v) Less any payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (vi) Less proper deductions authorized in writing by such producer, and plus or minus adjustments for errors in previous payments to such producer subject to approval by the market administrator;

        (vii) Less deductions for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86; and

        (viii) Less deductions authorized by CDFA for the California Quota Program pursuant to § 1051.11.

        (b)  On or before the day prior to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section (except as provided in § 1000.90), each handler shall pay to a cooperative association for milk from producers who market their milk through the cooperative association and who have authorized the cooperative to collect such payments on their behalf an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such producer milk pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (c)  On or before the day prior to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section (except as provided in § 1000.90), each handler who receives fluid milk products at its plant from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant or who receives milk from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c), including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, shall pay the cooperative for such milk as follows:

        (1) For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant and for milk received from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c) during the first 15 days of the month, at not less than the lowest announced class prices per hundredweight for the preceding month;

        (2) For the total quantity of bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, at not less than the total value of such products received from the association's pool plants, as determined by multiplying the respective quantities assigned to each class under § 1000.44, as follows:

        (i) The hundredweight of Class I skim milk times the Class I skim milk price for the month plus the pounds of Class I butterfat times the Class I butterfat price for the month. The Class I price to be used shall be that price effective at the location of the receiving plant;

        (ii) The pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price;

        (iii) The pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price;

        (vi) The pounds of protein in Class III milk times the protein price;

        (vii) The pounds of other solids in Class III milk times the other solids price; and

        (viii) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section and from that sum deduct any payment made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

        (3) For the total quantity of milk received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under § 1000.9(c) as follows:

        (i) The hundredweight of producer milk received times the producer price differential as adjusted pursuant to § 1051.75;

        (ii) The pounds of butterfat received times the butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) The pounds of protein received times the protein price for the month;

        (iv) The pounds of other solids received times the other solids price for the month; and

        (v) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section and from that sum deduct any payment made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (d)  If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1051.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata its payments to producers or to the cooperative association (with respect to receipts described in paragraph (b) of this section, prorating the underpayment to the volume of milk received from the cooperative association in proportion to the total milk received from producers by the handler), but not by more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (e)  If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant, as the case may be.

        (f)  In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in a form that may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and payroll number of the producer;

        (2) The daily and total pounds, and the month and dates such milk was received from that producer;

        (3) The total pounds of butterfat, protein, and other solids contained in the producer's milk;

#### § § 1124.7

        means a plant, unit of plants, or a system of plants as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraph (c) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section:

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or § ____.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which during any month not less than 20 percent of the total quantity of milk that is physically received at such plant from dairy farmers eligible to be producers pursuant to § 1124.12 (excluding milk received at such plant as diverted milk from another plant, which milk is classified other than Class I under the order in this part and is subject to the pricing and pooling provisions of this or another order issued pursuant to the Act) or diverted as producer milk to another plant pursuant to § 1124.13, is shipped in the form of a fluid milk product (excluding concentrated milk transferred by agreement for other than Class I use) to a pool distributing plant or is a route disposition in the marketing area of fluid milk products processed and packaged at such plant;

        (1) A supply plant that has qualified as a pool plant during each of the immediately preceding months of September through February shall continue to so qualify in each of the following months of March through August, unless the plant operator files a written request with the market administrator that such plant not be a pool plant, such nonpool status to be effective the first month following such request and thereafter until the plant qualifies as a pool plant on the basis of milk shipments;

        (2) No plant may qualify as a pool plant due to a reduction in the shipping percentage pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section unless it has been a pool supply plant during each of the immediately preceding 3 months.

        (d) A manufacturing plant located within the marketing area and operated by a cooperative association, or its wholly owned subsidiary, if, during the month, or the immediately preceding 12-month period ending with the current month, 20 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the association (and any producer milk of nonmembers and members of another cooperative association which may be marketed by the cooperative association) is physically received in the form of bulk fluid milk products (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other that Class I) at plants specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (e) of this section either directly from farms or by transfer from supply plants operated by the cooperative association, or its wholly owned subsidiary, and from plants of the cooperative association, or its wholly owned subsidiary, for which pool plant status has been requested under this paragraph subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section or under comparable provisions of another Federal order; and

        (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for the handling of milk approved for fluid consumption in the marketing area.

        (3) A request is filed in writing with the market administrator before the first day of the month for which it is to be effective. The request will remain in effect until a cancellation request is filed in writing with the market administrator before the first day of the month for which the cancellation is to be effective.

        (e) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1124.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1124.7(a) or (b);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        (iii) The plant is described in § 1000.8(a) or (e); or

        (iv) A producer-handler described in § 1124.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (f) A system of two or more plants identified in § 1124.7(d) operated by one or more cooperative handlers may qualify for pooling by meeting the above shipping requirements subject to the following additional requirements:

        (1) The cooperative handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator on or before the first day of the month for which the system is to be effective requesting that such plants qualify as a system. Such request will contain a list of the plants participating in the system in the order, beginning with the last plant, in which the plants will be dropped from the system if the system fails to qualify. Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system until the handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request before the first day of the month to the market administrator that the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any system. In the event of an ownership change or the business failure of a handler that is a participant in the system, the system may be reorganized to reflect such a change if a written request to file a new marketing agreement is submitted to the market administrator; and

        (2) If a system fails to qualify under the requirement of this paragraph, the handler responsible for qualifying the system shall notify the market administrator of which plant or plants will be deleted from the system so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a system. If the handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the system and continue up the list as necessary until the deliveries are sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the system.

        (g) The applicable shipping percentage of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired to be effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (h) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area; and

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order.

        § 1124.10   Producer-handler.

#### § § 1124.10

        means a person who operates a dairy farm and a distributing plant from which there is route disposition in the marketing area, from which total route disposition and packaged sales of fluid milk products to other plants during the month does not exceed 3 million pounds, and who the market administrator has designated a producer-handler after determining that all of the requirements of this section have been met.

        (a)  Designation of any person as a producer-handler by the market administrator shall be contingent upon meeting the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. Following the cancellation of a previous producer-handler designation, a person seeking to have their producer-handler designation reinstated must demonstrate that these conditions have been met for the preceding month.

        (1) The care and management of the dairy animals and the other resources and facilities designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section necessary to produce all Class I milk handled (excluding receipts from handlers fully regulated under any Federal order) are under the complete and exclusive control, ownership and management of the producer-handler and are operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and its own risk.

        (2) The plant operation designated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section at which the producer-handler processes and packages, and from which it distributes, its own milk production is under the complete and exclusive control, ownership and management of the producer-handler and is operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and at its sole risk.

        (3) The producer-handler neither receives at its designated milk production resources and facilities nor receives, handles, processes, or distributes at or through any of its designated milk handling, processing, or distributing resources and facilities other source milk products for reconstitution into fluid milk products or fluid milk products derived from any source other than:

        (i) Its designated milk production resources and facilities (own farm production);

        (ii) Pool handlers and plants regulated under any Federal order within the limitation specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or

        (iii) Nonfat milk solids which are used to fortify fluid milk products.

        (4) The producer-handler is neither directly nor indirectly associated with the business control or management of, nor has a financial interest in, another handler's operation; nor is any other handler so associated with the producer-handler's operation.

        (5) No milk produced by the herd(s) or on the farm(s) that supply milk to the producer-handler's plant operation is:

        (i) Subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns, or

        (ii) Marketed in any part as Class I milk to the non-pool distributing plant of any other handler.

        (b)  Designation of a person as a producer-handler shall include the determination of what shall constitute milk production, handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities, all of which shall be considered an integrated operation, under the sole and exclusive ownership of the producer-handler.

        (1) Milk production resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (milking herd(s), buildings housing such herd(s), and the land on which such buildings are located) used for the production of milk which are solely owned, operated, and which the producer-handler has designated as a source of milk supply for the producer-handler's plant operation. However, for purposes of this paragraph, any such milk production resources and facilities which do not constitute an actual or potential source of milk supply for the producer-handler's operation shall not be considered a part of the producer-handler's milk production resources and facilities.

        (2) Milk handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (including store outlets) used for handling, processing, and distributing fluid milk products which are solely owned by, and directly operated or controlled by the producer-handler or in which the producer-handler in any way has an interest, including any contractual arrangement, or over which the producer-handler directly or indirectly exercises any degree of management control.

        (3) All designations shall remain in effect until canceled, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  The designation as a producer-handler shall be canceled upon determination by the market administrator that any of the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) through (5) of this section are not continuing to be met, or under any of the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) or (3) of this section. Cancellation of a producer-handler's status pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the requirements were not met or the conditions for cancellation occurred.

        (1) Milk from the milk production resources and facilities of the producer-handler, designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is delivered in the name of another person as producer milk to another handler.

        (2) The producer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from sources other than the milk production facilities and resources designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that it may receive at its plant, or acquire for route disposition, fluid milk products from fully regulated plants and handlers under any Federal order if such receipts do not exceed 150,000 pounds monthly. This limitation shall not apply if the producer-handler's own-farm production is less than 150,000 pounds during the month.

        (3) Milk from the milk production resources and facilities of the producer-handler is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan operating under the authority of a State government.

        (d)  The market administrator shall publicly announce:

        (1) The name, plant location(s), and farm location(s) of persons designated as producer-handlers;

        (2) The names of those persons whose designations have been cancelled; and

        (3) The effective dates of producer-handler status or loss of producer-handler status for each. Such announcements shall be controlling with respect to the accounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from any producer-handler.

        (e)  The burden rests upon the handler who is designated as a producer-handler to establish through records required pursuant to § 1000.27 that the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section have been and are continuing to be met, and that the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for cancellation of the designation do not exist.

        (f) Any producer-handler with Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter shall be subject to payments into the Order 1131 producer settlement fund on such dispositions pursuant to § 1000.76(a) and payments into the Order 1131 administrative fund provided such dispositions are less than three million pounds in the current month and such producer-handler had total Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products from own farm production of three million pounds or more the previous month. If the producer-handler has Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products into the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of this chapter of three million pounds or more during the current month, such producer-handler shall be subject to the provisions described in § 1131.7 of this chapter or § 1000.76(a).

        § 1124.11   Cooperative reserve supply unit.

#### § § 1124.11

        Cooperative reserve supply unit means any cooperative association or its agent that is a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c) that does not own or operate a plant, if such cooperative has been qualified to receive payments pursuant to § 1124.73 and has been a handler of producer milk under the order in this part or its predecessor order during each of the 12 previous months, and if a majority of the cooperative's member producers are located within 125 miles of a plant described in § 1124.7(a). A cooperative reserve supply unit shall be subject to the following conditions:

        (a) The cooperative shall file a request with the market administrator for cooperative reserve supply unit status at least 15 days prior to the first day of the month in which such status is desired to be effective. Once qualified as a cooperative reserve supply unit pursuant to this paragraph, such status shall continue to be effective unless the cooperative requests termination prior to the first day of the month that change of status is requested, or the cooperative fails to meet all of the conditions of this section.

        (b) The cooperative reserve supply unit supplies fluid milk products to pool distributing plants located within 125 miles of a majority of the cooperative's member producers in compliance with any announcement by the market administrator requesting a minimum level of shipments as follows:

        (1) The market administrator may require such supplies of bulk fluid milk from cooperative reserve supply units whenever the market administrator finds that milk supplies for Class I use are needed for plants defined in § 1124.7(a) or (b). Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for such shipments either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the market administrator's investigation shows that such shipments might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that a shipping announcement is being considered and inviting data, views and arguments with respect to the proposed shipping announcement. Any decision on the required shipment of bulk fluid milk from cooperative reserve supply units must be made in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (2) Failure of a cooperative reserve supply unit to comply with any announced shipping requirements, including making any significant change in the unit's marketing operation that the market administrator determines has the impact of evading or forcing such an announcement, shall result in immediate loss of cooperative reserve supply unit status until such time as the unit has been a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c) for at least 12 consecutive months.

        § 1124.12   Producer.

#### § § 1124.12

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section,  means any person who produces milk approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for fluid consumption as Grade A milk and whose milk (or components of milk) is:

        (1) Received at a pool plant directly from the producer or diverted by the plant operator in accordance with § 1124.13; or

        (2) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c).

        (b) Producer shall not include:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined in any Federal order;

        (2) A dairy farmer whose milk is received at an exempt plant, excluding producer milk diverted to the exempt plant pursuant to § 1124.13(e);

        (3) A dairy farmer whose milk is received by diversion at a pool plant from a handler regulated under another Federal order if the other Federal order designates the dairy farmer as a producer under that order and that milk is allocated by request to a utilization other than Class I;

        (4) A dairy farmer whose milk is reported as diverted to a plant fully regulated under another Federal order with respect to that portion of the milk so diverted that is assigned to Class I under the provisions of such other order; and

        (5) A dairy farmer whose milk was received at a nonpool plant during the month from the same farm as other than producer milk under the order in this part or any other Federal order. Such a dairy farmer shall be known as a

        § 1124.13   Producer milk.

#### § § 1124.13

        Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section,  means the skim milk (or skim milk equivalent of components of skim milk), including nonfat components, and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:

        (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;

        (b) Received by a cooperative reserve supply unit described in § 1124.11. All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received and shall not be subject to the conditions specified in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (c) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

        (d) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

        (e) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(c), excluding a cooperative reserve supply unit described in § 1124.11, to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least 3 days' production of such dairy farmer's production is physically received at a pool plant during the month.

        (2) Of the quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversions, but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c)) the handler diverts to nonpool plants not more than 80 percent.

        (3) Two or more handlers described in § 1000.9(c) may have their allowable diversions computed on the basis of their combined deliveries of producer milk which they caused to be delivered to pool plants or diverted during the month if each has filed a request in writing with the market administrator before the first day of the month the agreement is to be effective. The request shall specify the basis for assigning overdiverted milk to the producer deliveries of each according to a method approved by the market administrator.

        (4) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;

        (5) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk. In the event some of the milk of any producer is determined not to be producer milk pursuant to this paragraph, other milk delivered by such producer as producer milk during the month will not be subject to § 1124.12(b)(5).

        (6) The delivery day requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the diversion percentage in paragraph (e)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure the orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired to be effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise the delivery day requirement or the diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (f) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.

        § 1124.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1124.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (i) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44 (a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76 (a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Class I value.

        (1) Multiply the hundredweight of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b) Class II value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c) Class III value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d) Class IV value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (f) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (g) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3) (i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (i) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1124.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1124.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1124.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1124.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1124.30;

        (b) Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1124.60 by the protein price, the other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively;

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1124.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1124.60(h); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

        (a) Each handler shall pay each producer for producer milk for which payment is not made to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 18th day of the month, partial payment shall be made so that it is received by each producer on or before the last day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month from the producer at not less than the lowest announced class price for the preceding month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by each producer no later than the 19th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) in an amount equal to not less than the sum of:

        (i) The hundredweight of producer milk received times the producer price differential for the month as adjusted pursuant to § 1124.75;

        (ii) The pounds of butterfat received times the butterfat price for the month;

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which 50 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received during the month from dairy farmers and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted as producer milk to other plants, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) A plant located within the marketing area that is operated by a cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is requested for such plant by the cooperative association and during the month at least 30 percent of the producer milk of members of such cooperative association is delivered directly from farms to pool distributing plants or is transferred to such plants as a fluid milk product (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I) from the cooperative's plant.

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located within the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process only Class I or Class II products and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (3) A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants from a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which it is to be effective.

        (f) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (g) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler plant;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located within the marketing area if the plant also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and more than 50 percent of its route distribution has been in such other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is not located within any Federal order marketing area that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located in another Federal order marketing area if the plant meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and

        (7) That portion of a pool plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.

        (h) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1126.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:

        (i) The plant is described in § 1126.7(a), (b), or (e);

        (ii) The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;

        § 1126.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1126.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section shall result from the steps set forth in § 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Class I value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim milk price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price.

        (b) Class II value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price.

        (c) Class III value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the protein price;

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and

        (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat price.

        (d) Class IV value.

        (1) Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price; and

        (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price.

        (e) Compute an adjustment for the somatic cell content of producer milk by multiplying the values reported pursuant to § 1126.30(a)(1) and (c)(1) by the percentage of total producer milk allocated to Class II, Class III, and Class IV pursuant to § 1000.44(c);

        (f) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each class.

        (g) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants.

        (i) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (j) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1126.61   Computation of producer price differential.

#### § § 1126.61

        For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1126.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:

        (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1126.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in § 1126.30;

        (b) Subtract the total of the values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to § 1126.60 by the protein price, other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively, and the total value of the somatic cell adjustment pursuant to § 1126.30(a)(1) and (c)(1);

        (c) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1126.75;

        (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

        (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1126.60(i); and

        (f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The result shall be known as the producer price differential for the month.

#### § § 1126.72

        No later than the 17th day after the end of each month (except as provided in § 1000.90), the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to § 1126.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to § 1126.71(a).

#### § § 1126.73

        (a) Each handler shall pay each producer for producer milk for which payment is not made to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 23rd day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 26th day of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the lowest announced class price for the preceding month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by each producer no later than the 18th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90) in an amount computed as follows:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received times the producer price differential for the month as adjusted pursuant to § 1126.75;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of butterfat received times the butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the pounds of protein received times the protein price for the month;

        (iv) Multiply the pounds of other solids received times the other solids price for the month;

        (v) Multiply the hundredweight of milk received times the somatic cell adjustment for the month;

        (vi) Add the amounts computed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer subject to approval by the market administrator; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) On or before the day prior to the dates specified for partial and final payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section (except as provided in § 1000.90), each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity, except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be equal to the hundredweight of milk received multiplied by the lowest announced class price for the preceding month.

        (2)  For bulk milk/skimmed milk products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  Following the classification of bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment for such receipts shall be determined as follows:

        (i) The hundredweight of Class I skim milk times the Class I skim milk price for the month plus the pounds of Class I butterfat times the Class I butterfat price for the month. The Class I prices to be used shall be the prices effective at the location of the receiving plant;

        (ii) The pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price;

        (iii) The pounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price;

        (iv) The pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV times the nonfat solids price;

        (vii) The pounds of other solids in Class III milk times the other solids price;

        (viii) The hundredweight of Class II, Class III, and Class IV milk times the somatic cell adjustment; and

        (ix) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section and from that sum deduct any payments made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1126.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata its payments to producers or to cooperative associations pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but by not more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in a form that may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The name, address, Grade A identifier assigned by a duly constituted regulatory agency, and the payroll number of the producer;

        (4) The somatic cell count of the producer's milk;

        (5) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (6) The rate used in making payment if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        (7) The amount, or rate per hundredweight, or rate per pound of component, and the nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

        (8) The net amount of payment to the producer or cooperative association.

        § 1131.7   Pool plant.

#### § § 1131.7

        means a plant or unit of plants specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (g) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.

        (a) A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this § ____. 7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.

        (b) Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.

        (c) A supply plant from which 50 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received at such plant from dairy farmers and handlers described in § 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted as producer milk to other plants, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.

        (d) A plant located within the marketing area and operated by a cooperative association if, during the month, or the immediately preceding 12-month period ending with the current month, 35 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the association (and any producer milk of nonmembers and members of another cooperative association which may be marketed by the cooperative association) is physically received in the form of bulk fluid milk products (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other that Class I) at plants specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (h) of this section either directly from farms or by transfer from supply plants operated by the cooperative association and from plants of the cooperative association for which pool plant status has been requested under this paragraph subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (h) of this section or under comparable provisions of another Federal order; and

        (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for the handling of milk approved for fluid consumption in the marketing area.

        (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located in the marketing area may qualify for pool plant status as a unit by together meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and subject to all of the following additional requirements:

        (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;

        (2) Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products, and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

        (3) A written request to form a unit must be filed by the handler with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month to month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.

        (f) The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (g) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:

        (1) A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;

        (2) An exempt plant as defined in § 1000.8(e);

        (3) A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (4) A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;

        (5) A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;

        (6) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and

        (7) That portion of a regulated plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in advance and in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.

        (h) Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in § 1131.2;

        (1) From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk.

#### § § 1131.10

        means a person who operates a dairy farm and a distributing plant from which there is route disposition in the marketing area, from which total route disposition and packaged sales of fluid milk products to other plants during the month does not exceed 3 million pounds, and who the market administrator has designated a producer-handler after determining that all of the requirements of this section have been met.

        (a)  Designation of any person as a producer-handler by the market administrator shall be contingent upon meeting the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. Following the cancellation of a previous producer-handler designation, a person seeking to have their producer-handler designation reinstated must demonstrate that these conditions have been met for the preceding month.

        (1) The care and management of the dairy animals and the other resources and facilities designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section necessary to produce all Class I milk handled (excluding receipts from handlers fully regulated under any Federal order) are under the complete and exclusive control, ownership and management of the producer-handler and are operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and its own risk.

        (2) The plant operation designated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section at which the producer-handler processes and packages, and from which it distributes, its own milk production is under the complete and exclusive control, ownership and management of the producer-handler and is operated as the producer-handler's own enterprise and at its sole risk.

        (3) The producer-handler neither receives at its designated milk production resources and facilities nor receives, handles, processes, or distributes at or through any of its designated milk handling, processing, or distributing resources and facilities other source milk products for reconstitution into fluid milk products or fluid milk products derived from any source other than:

        (i) Its designated milk production resources and facilities (own farm production);

        (ii) Pool handlers and plants regulated under any Federal order within the limitation specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or

        (iii) Nonfat milk solids which are used to fortify fluid milk products.

        (4) The producer-handler is neither directly nor indirectly associated with the business control or management of, nor has a financial interest in, another handler's operation; nor is any other handler so associated with the producer-handler's operation.

        (5) No milk produced by the herd(s) or on the farm(s) that supply milk to the producer-handler's plant operation is:

        (i) Subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns, or

        (ii) Marketed in any part as Class I milk to the non-pool distributing plant of any other handler.

        (6) The producer-handler does not distribute fluid milk products to a wholesale customer who is served by a plant described in § 1131.7(a), (b), or (e), or a handler described in § 1000.8(c) that supplied the same product in the same-sized package with a similar label to a wholesale customer during the month.

        (b)  Designation of a person as a producer-handler shall include the determination of what shall constitute milk production, handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities, all of which shall be considered an integrated operation, under the sole and exclusive ownership of the producer-handler.

        (1) Milk production resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (milking herd(s), buildings housing such herd(s), and the land on which such buildings are located) used for the production of milk which are solely owned, operated, and which the producer-handler has designated as a source of milk supply for the producer-handler's plant operation. However, for purposes of this paragraph, any such milk production resources and facilities which do not constitute an actual or potential source of milk supply for the producer-handler's operation shall not be considered a part of the producer-handler's milk production resources and facilities.

        (2) Milk handling, processing, and distribution resources and facilities shall include all resources and facilities (including store outlets) used for handling, processing, and distributing fluid milk products which are solely owned by, and directly operated or controlled by the producer-handler or in which the producer-handler in any way has an interest, including any contractual arrangement, or over which the producer-handler directly or indirectly exercises any degree of management control.

        (3) All designations shall remain in effect until canceled pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  The designation as a producer-handler shall be canceled upon determination by the market administrator that any of the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) through (5) of this section are not continuing to be met, or under any of the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) or (3) of this section. Cancellation of a producer-handler's status pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the requirements were not met or the conditions for cancellation occurred.

        (1) Milk from the milk production resources and facilities of the producer-handler, designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is delivered in the name of another person as producer milk to another handler.

        (2) The producer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from sources other than the milk production facilities and resources designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that it may receive at its plant, or acquire for route disposition, fluid milk products from fully regulated plants and handlers under any Federal order if such receipts do not exceed 150,000 pounds monthly. This limitation shall not apply if the producer-handler's own-farm production is less than 150,000 pounds during the month.

        (3) Milk from the milk production resources and facilities of the producer-handler is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan operating under the authority of a State government.

        (d)  The market administrator shall publicly announce:

        (1) The name, plant location(s), and farm location(s) of persons designated as producer-handlers;

        (2) The names of those persons whose designations have been cancelled; and

        (3) The effective dates of producer-handler status or loss of producer-handler status for each. Such announcements shall be controlling with respect to the accounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from any producer-handler.

        (e)  The burden rests upon the handler who is designated as a producer-handler to establish through records required pursuant to § 1000.27 that the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section have been and are continuing to be met, and that the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for cancellation of the designation do not exist.

        (f) Any producer-handler with Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in the marketing area described in § 1131.2 shall be subject to payments into the Order 1131 producer settlement fund on such dispositions pursuant to § 1000.76(a) and payments into the Order 1131 administrative fund provided such dispositions are less than three million pounds in the current month and such producer-handler had total Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products from own farm production of three million pounds or more the previous month. If the producer-handler has Class I route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products into the marketing area described in § 1131.2 of three million pounds or more during the current month, such producer-handler shall be subject to the provisions described in § 1131.7 or § 1000.76(a).

        (3) A dairy farmer whose milk is received by diversion at a pool plant from a handler regulated under another Federal order if the other Federal order designates the dairy farmer as a producer under that order and that milk is allocated by request to a utilization other than Class I;

        (4) A dairy farmer whose milk is reported as diverted to a plant fully regulated under another Federal order with respect to that portion of the milk so diverted that is assigned to Class I under the provisions of such other order; and

        (5) A dairy farmer whose milk is received at a pool plant if during the month milk from the same farm is received at a nonpool plant (except a nonpool plant that has no utilization of milk products in any class other than Class III or Class IV) other than as producer milk under the order in this part or some other Federal order. Such a dairy farmer shall be known as a

        § 1131.13   Producer milk.

#### § § 1131.13

        means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk) and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:

        (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;

        (b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

        (c) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

        (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least one day's production of such dairy farmer is physically received at a pool plant during the month;

        (2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a handler in any month shall not exceed 50 percent of the total producer milk caused by the handler to be received at pool plants and diverted;

        (3) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;

        (4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk. In the event some of the milk of any producer is determined not to be producer milk pursuant to this paragraph, other milk delivered by such producer as producer milk during the month will not be subject to § 1131.12(b)(5); and

        (5) The delivery day requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and diversion percentage in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise the delivery day requirement or the diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.

        (e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan under the authority of a State government.

        § 1131.60   Handler's value of milk.

#### § § 1131.60

        For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in § 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (f) of this section. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under § 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.

        (a) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to § 1000.44(c) by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts;

        (b) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of § 1000.44(b) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;

        (c) Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b);

        (d) Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;

        (e) Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to § 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of § 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.

        (f) For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to § 1000.43(d).

        § 1131.61   Computation of uniform prices.

#### § § 1131.61

        On or before the 11th day of each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform butterfat price, a uniform skim milk price, and a uniform price for producer milk receipts reported for the prior month. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to § 1131.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of these prices, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations.

        (a)  The uniform butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be computed by:

        (1) Multiplying the pounds of butterfat in producer milk allocated to each class pursuant to § 1000.44(b) by the respective class butterfat prices;

        (2) Adding the butterfat value calculated in § 1131.60(e) for other source milk allocated to Class I pursuant to § 1000.43(d) and the steps of § 1000.44(b) that correspond to § 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and § 1000.44(a)(8) by the Class I price; and

        (3) Dividing the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

        (b)  The uniform skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be computed as follows:

        (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to § 1131.60 for all handlers;

        (2) Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to § 1131.75;

        (3) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;

        (4) Subtract the value of the total pounds of butterfat for all handlers. The butterfat value shall be computed by multiplying the sum of the pounds of butterfat in producer milk and other source milk used to calculate the values in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the butterfat price computed in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (5) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:

        (i) The total skim pounds of producer milk; and

        (ii) The total skim pounds for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1131.60(e); and

        (6) Subtract not less than 4 cents and not more than 5 cents.

        (c)  The uniform price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the sum of the following:

        (1) Multiply the uniform butterfat price for the month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section times 3.5 pounds of butterfat; and

        (2) Multiply the uniform skim milk price for the month pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section times .965.

Payments due the market administrator shall be deemed not to have been made until the money owed has been received at the market administrator's office, or deposited into the market administrator's bank account. Payment shall be the amount, if any, by which the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (b) of this section:

        (a) The total value of milk to the handler for the month as determined pursuant to § 1131.60.

        (b) The sum of:

        (1) The value at the uniform prices for skim milk and butterfat, adjusted for plant location, of the handler's receipts of producer milk; and

        (2) The value at the uniform price as adjusted pursuant to § 1131.75 applicable at the location of the plant from which received of other source milk for which a value is computed pursuant to § 1131.60(e).

        § 1131.72   Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

#### § § 1131.72

        No later than the 14th day after the end of each month (except as provided in § 1000.90), the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to § 1131.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to § 1131.71(a). If, at such time, the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete the payments as soon as the funds are available.

        § 1131.73   Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

#### § § 1131.73

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each handler shall make payment to each producer from whom milk is received during the month as follows:

        (1)  For each producer who has not discontinued shipments as of the 25th day of the month, payment shall be made so that it is received by the producer on or before the 27th day of each month (except as provided in § 1000.90) for milk received from such producer during the first 15 days of the month at not less than 1.3 times the lowest class price for the preceding month less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (2)  For milk received during the month, a payment computed as follows shall be made so that it is received by each producer one day after the payment date required in § 1131.72:

        (i) Multiply the hundredweight of producer skim milk received times the uniform skim milk price for the month;

        (ii) Multiply the pounds of producer butterfat received times the uniform butterfat price for the month;

        (iii) Multiply the hundredweight of producer milk received times the plant location adjustment pursuant to § 1131.75; and

        (iv) Add the amounts computed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, and from that sum:

        (A) Subtract the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (B) Subtract the deduction for marketing services pursuant to § 1000.86;

        (C) Add or subtract for errors made in previous payments to the producer, subject to approval by the market administrator; and

        (D) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer.

        (b) Two days prior to the dates on which partial and final payments are due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk received as follows:

        (1)  For bulk milk (including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk) received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in any capacity except as the operator of a pool plant, the payment shall be an amount not less than 1.3 times the lowest class price for the preceding month multiplied by the hundredweight of milk.

        (2)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the first 15 days of the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the partial payment shall be at the pool plant operator's estimated use value of the milk using the most recent class prices available for skim milk and butterfat at the receiving plant's location.

        (3)  For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, the final payment shall be the classified value of such milk as determined by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and butterfat assigned to each class pursuant to § 1000.44 by the class prices for the month at the receiving plant's location, and subtracting from this sum the partial payment made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  For bulk milk received from a cooperative association during the month, including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, the final payment for such milk shall be an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for such milk pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1131.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata his payments pursuant to such paragraphs, but by not more than the amount of such underpayment. Payments to producers shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.

        (d) If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund. In the event the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or the lawful claimant, as the case may be.

        (e) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each pool plant operator shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in such form that it may be retained by the recipient which shall show:

        (1) The month, and identity of the producer;

        (2) The daily and total pounds and the total pounds of butterfat content of producer milk;

        (3) The minimum rate at which payment to the producer is required pursuant to the order in this part;

        (4) The rate used in making payments if the rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;

        (5) The amount, rate per hundredweight, and nature of each deduction claimed by the handler; and

        (6) The net amount of payment to the producer or cooperative association.

        (e) At least every five years, and not more than every three years, the Board shall review the geographic distribution of milk production volume throughout the United States and, if warranted, shall recommend to the Secretary a reapportionment of regions and/or a modification of the number of producer members from regions in order to best reflect the geographic distribution of milk production volume in the United States.

        (f) At least once every three years, after the initial appointment of importer representatives on the Board, the Secretary shall review the average volume of domestic production of dairy products compared to the average volume of imports of dairy products into the United States during the previous three years and, on the basis of that review, if warranted, reapportion the importer representation on the Board to reflect the proportional shares of the United States market served by domestic production and imported dairy products. The basis for comparison of domestic production of dairy products to imported products shall be estimated total milk solids.

        Nominations for members of the Board shall be made in the following manner:

        (a) The Secretary shall solicit nominations for producer representation on the Board from all eligible organizations. For nominations of producers, if the Secretary determines that a substantial number of producers are not members of, or their interests are not represented by, such eligible organizations, the Secretary shall also solicit nominations from such producers through general farmer organizations or by other means.

        (b) After the appointment of the initial Board, the Secretary shall announce at least 120 days in advance when a Board member's term is expiring and shall solicit nominations for that position in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this section. Nominations for such position should be submitted to the Secretary not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of such term.

        (c) An eligible producer organization may submit nominations only for positions on the Board that represent regions in which such eligible organization can establish that it represents a substantial number of producers. If there is more than one Board position for any such region, the organization may submit nominations for each position.

        (d) Where there is more than one eligible organization representing producers in a specific geographic region, the organizations may caucus and jointly nominate producers for each position representing that region on the Board for which a member is to be appointed. If joint agreement is not reached with respect to any such nominations, or if no caucus is held, each eligible organization may submit to the Secretary nominations for each appointment to be made to represent that region.

        (e) Nominations for representation of importers may be submitted by:

        (1) Organizations that represent importers of dairy products, as approved by the Secretary. The primary considerations in determining if organizations adequately represent importers of dairy products shall be whether its membership consists primarily of importers of dairy products and whether a substantial interest of the organization is in the importation of dairy products and the promotion of the nutritional attributes of dairy products; and

        (2) Individual importers of dairy products. Individual importers submitting nominations to represent importers on the Board must establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the persons submitting the nominations are importers of dairy products.

The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Board, whichever is earlier.

        (2) For the purpose of this section, any assessment not collected by CBP at the time entry summary documents are filed by the importer is considered to be past due. If CBP does not collect an assessment from an importer, the importer shall be responsible for paying the assessment and any late charges to the Secretary in the form of a negotiable instrument made payable to “USDA.” The payment shall be mailed to a location designated by the Secretary or sent in an electronic form approved by the Secretary.

        (2) The exemption shall apply to all certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) products of the producer regardless of whether the agricultural commodity subject to the exemption is produced by a person that also produces conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed;

        (3) The producer maintains a valid certificate of organic operation as issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501-6522) (OFPA) and the NOP regulations issued under OFPA (7 CFR part 205); and

        (4) Any producer so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under this part that are associated with any agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section.

        (b) To apply for exemption under this section, a producer subject to assessments pursuant to § 1150.152(a)(1) and (2) shall submit a request to the Board on an  (Form AMS-15) at any time during the year initially, and annually thereafter on or before July 1, for as long as the producer continues to be eligible for the exemption.

If the processor owes money to the Board, it shall remit that amount by the next date for remitting assessments as provided in § 1160.211. For the first two erroneous reports submitted by a processor in the preceding 12-month period, late-payment charges assessed pursuant to § 1160.214 shall not begin to accrue until the day following such date. For all additional erroneous reports submitted by a processor during the 12-month period, late-payment charges shall accrue from the date the payment was due. If the processor has overpaid, that amount shall be credited to its account and applied against amounts due in succeeding months.

#### § § 1160.214

        (a) Late-payment charge. Any unpaid assessments shall be increased 1.5 percent each month beginning with the day following the date such assessments were due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of the failure of a processor to submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due. The receipt of a payment by the Board will be based on the earlier of the postmark date or the actual date of receipt.

        (b) Penalties. The Secretary may assess any person who violates any provision of this subpart a civil penalty of not less than nor more than the minimum and maximum amounts specified in § 3.91(b)(1)(xxxv) of this title for each such violation. In the case of a willful failure to pay an assessment as required by this subpart, in addition to the amount due, the Secretary may assess an additional penalty of not less than nor more than the minimum and maximum amounts specified in § 3.91(b)(1)(xxxv) of this title for each such violation. The amount of any such penalty shall accrue to the United States, which may recover such amount in a civil suit.
