      § 1767.11   Purpose.

#### § § 1767.11

      (a) The standard form of RUS loan documents for electric borrowers requires that the borrower keep books, records, and accounts in which full and true entries will be made of all of the dealings, business and affairs of the borrower in accordance with the methods and principles of accounting of this part.

      (b) This subpart implements these provisions of the RUS loan documents by prescribing the RUS USoA for electric borrowers and by providing accounting methodologies and procedures which are applicable to particular situations.

      § 1767.12   Accounting system requirements.

#### § § 1767.12

      (a) Each Rural Development electric borrower must maintain and keep its books of accounts and all other books and records that support the entries in such books of accounts in accordance with §§ 1767.13-1767.31.

      (b) Each RUS electric borrower shall maintain and keep its books of accounts and all other books and records which support the entries in such books of accounts in accordance with § 1767.41, Accounting Methods and Procedures Required of All RUS Borrowers, herein, which prescribes accounting principles to be applied to specific factual circumstances.

      § 1767.13   Departures from the prescribed RUS Uniform System of Accounts.

#### § § 1767.13

      (a) No departures are to be made to the prescribed Rural Development USoA without the prior written approval of Rural Development. Requests for departures from the Rural Development USoA shall be addressed, in writing, to the Assistant Administrator, Program Accounting and Regulatory Analysis. (AA-PARA).

      (b) RUS borrowers subject to the jurisdiction of a state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over rates and/or accounting for electric utilities will not:

      (1) Request approval of such authority to use accounting methodologies and principles that depart from the provisions herein; or

      (2) File with such authority, any documents or information, including without limitation, any filings associated with the borrower's rates, based upon accounting methods and principles inconsistent with the provisions of this part.

      (c) If any state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over an RUS borrower prescribes accounting methods or principles for the borrower that are inconsistent with the provisions of this part, the borrower must immediately notify the Director, BAD, and provide such documents, information, and reports as RUS may request to evaluate the impact that such accounting methods or principles may have on the interests of RUS.

      (1) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles do not adversely impact RUS interests, RUS will permit the borrower to use the accounting methods and principles as prescribed by the state regulatory authority to comply with the provisions of the RUS loan documents.

      (2) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles may adversely impact RUS's interests, RUS may require that, for the purposes of complying with provisions of RUS loan documents, including, without limitation, those provisions relating to financial coverage standards (e.g. “TIER”), the borrower continue to maintain books, records, and accounts in accordance with this subpart.

      (i) RUS may, however, approve requests by the borrower to maintain such additional books, records, and accounts as necessary to comply with the requirements of the state regulatory authority.

      (ii) Such approval will not waive, modify or amend the requirements of the RUS loan documents or of this subpart.

      (d) RUS borrowers will not implement the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, SFAS No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs, SFAS No. 92, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans, without the prior written approval of RUS except as provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. Requests for approval shall be addressed, in writing, to the Director, PASD. The specific deferrals set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section may be implemented without the prior written approval of RUS provided that the deferrals comply with Statement No. 71 and that the RUS borrowers implementing such deferrals continue to meet the requirements set forth in Statement No. 71 for doing so:

      (1) The deferral and amortization of prior service pension costs (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 606, Pension Costs), remapping expenses (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 613, Mapping Costs), and preliminary survey and investigation charges (See § 1767.17, Interpretation No. 111, Engineering Contracts for System Planning);

      (2) The deferral of any current period expense or expenses, on a cumulative basis for the fiscal year, only if a borrower would have met each of its financial tests or coverage ratios that it has covenanted with RUS to meet for that fiscal year, had the deferral not been made;

      (3) The deferral of any cost that will be fully amortized within the next 12 succeeding months;

      (4) The accelerated amortization of any previously deferred expense; and

      (5) The deferral of revenues coincident with a moratorium imposed by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its Retirement and Security Program, provided, however, that the deferral is for the sole purpose of offsetting future pension costs.

      (e) RUS will consider approval of specific departures from this part upon submission of:

      (1) A detailed description of the proposed departure;

      (2) The specific accounting journal entries that will be used including the account number and title, and the dollar amounts where appropriate;

      (3) The total dollar amount of the departure and the impact on margins during the time period of the departure; and

      (4) A resolution from the borrower's Board of Directors authorizing such action; and

      (5) Any additional information RUS may deem necessary to adequately evaluate the borrower's request.

      (f) RUS will, within 90 days of final receipt of this information, render a decision on the borrower's request for a departure from the prescribed RUS USoA.

      (1) If, due to extenuating circumstances, RUS is unable to reach a decision within the required time period, RUS will notify the borrower of the delay within this same 90-day period, and provide a projected decision date.

      (2) The requested departure from the prescribed RUS USoA must not be implemented until final approval is granted by RUS.

#### § § 1767.15

      (a)  (1) Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account.

      (2) Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.

      (3) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.

      (4) No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by the rules and regulations contained in subpart D of this part.

      (5) In addition to the prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.

      (6) When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes.

      (7) The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by RUS.

      (b)  (1) The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:

      (2) In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.

      (3) The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles.

      (i) Each utility, however, may adopt, for its own purposes, a different system of account numbers provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry.

      (ii) If a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry.

      (iii) Each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available, a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein.

      (iv) The utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.

      (c)  (1) Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month, all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility.

      (2) Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly.

      (3) Each utility shall close its books at the end of each fiscal year unless otherwise authorized by RUS.

      (d)  To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to RUS for consideration and decision.

      (e)  (1) Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting.

      (2) The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive.

      (3) The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list.

      (4) The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.

      (f)  (1) Net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in § 1767.15 (g) and long-term debt as described in § 1767.15 (q).

      (2) Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are not typical or customary business activities of the company shall be considered extraordinary items.

      (3) They will be events and transactions of significant effect which would not be expected to recur frequently and which would not be considered as recurring factors in any evaluation of the ordinary operating processes of business.

      (i) In determining significance, items of a similar nature should be considered in the aggregate.

      (ii) Dissimilar items should be considered individually; however, if they are few in number, they may be considered in the aggregate.

      (iii) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items.

      (iv) RUS approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See Accounts 434 and 435.)

      (g)  (1) Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:

      (i) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year

      (ii) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.

      (2) All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.

      (h)  (1) Whenever a financial statement is required by RUS, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts.

      (2) The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.

      (i)  Charges to electric plant, operating expense, and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.

      (j)  (1) Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available.

      (2) Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations.

      (k)  (1) The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis.

      (i) This requires the inclusion, in its accounts, of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts.

      (ii) If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.

      (2) When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes, or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to Account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable, by credits to Account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.

      (l)  (1) Separate records shall be maintained by electric plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated.

      (2) The term “plant” as used herein includes each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines.

      (m)  (1) If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas or water, it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department.

      (2) It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.

      (n)  (1) Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies.

      (2) The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.

      (o)  (1) Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain.

      (2) Contingent liabilities include items which may, under certain conditions, become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its audited financial statements; its RUS Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, or its RUS Form 12, Operating Report—Financial; and at such other times as may be requested by RUS.

      (p)  The accounts or records of each borrower shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license:

      (1) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, and credits for property retired from service, as determined under RUS's regulations in 7 CFR chapter XVII;

      (ii) The premium will be recorded in Account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in Account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in Account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.

      (iii) The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities.

      (2)  (i) When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and cancelled, shall be included in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate.

      (ii) The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt).

      (iii) The amount so amortized shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

      (3)  (i) When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate.

      (ii) The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:

      (A) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant;

      (B) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired; or

      (C) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.

      (iii) Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis.

      (iv) The amounts in paragraphs (q)(3)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

      (4) Under methods in paragraphs (q)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issued retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs (q)(5) and (6) of this section.

      (5) When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and Account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 283.

      (6) When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes.

      (7) When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 108), the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis.

      (i) Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and Account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period.

      (ii) Account 282 shall be debited and Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.

      (8) The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations.

      (i) In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations.

      (ii) Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant.

      (9) Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of Account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.

      (10)  Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding:

      (i) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions.

      (ii) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.

      (r)  (1) Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method.

      (2) Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period.

      (3) Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility.

      (4) Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for rate making purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.

      (5) Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.

      (6) Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior RUS approval.

      (7) Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in Accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes; 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property; 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Taxes—Other, as appropriate.

      (8) The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by RUS.

      (s)  (1) If, at its inception, a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease:

      (i) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.

      (ii) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.

      (iii) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.

      (iv) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceed 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by lessor.

      (A) However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.

      (B) The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.

      (2) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section shall be applied for purposes of the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provision. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.

      (t)  (1) All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases.

      (2) The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases or Account 121, Nonutility Property;

      (3) The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in Account 101.1, Account 120.6, or Account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense, or Account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense, or Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and a credit to Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations.

      (4) Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.

      (5) For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.

      (u)  (1) Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (42 U.S.C. 7407 and 42 U.S.C. 7651), provides for the issuance of allowances as a means to limit the emissions of certain airborne pollutants by various entities, including utilities. Utilities owning allowances, other than those acquired for speculative purposes, shall account for such allowances at cost in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, or Account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, as appropriate. Allowances acquired for speculative purposes and identified as such in contemporaneous records at the time of purchase shall be accounted for in Account 124, Other Investments.

      (2) When purchased, allowances become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and in an amount equal to the purchase price.

      (3) The underlying records supporting Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be maintained in sufficient detail so as to provide the number of allowances and the related cost by vintage year.

      (4) Issuances from inventory included in Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances not used in the current year shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.

      (5) Account 158.1 shall be credited and Account 509, Allowances, debited so that the cost of the allowances to be remitted for the year is charged to expense monthly based on each month's emissions. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost of an allowance between months on a fractional basis.

      (6) In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge Account 158.1 with the estimated cost. This estimated cost of future allowance acquisitions shall be credited to Account 158.1 and charged to Account 509 in the same accounting period as the related charge to Account 158.1. Should the actual cost of these allowances differ from the estimated cost, the differences shall be recognized in the then-current period's inventory issuance cost.

      (7) Any penalties assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency for the emission of excess pollutants shall be charged to Account 426.3, Penalties.

      (8) Gains on dispositions of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in Account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to Account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to Account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances. Losses on disposition of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to Account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to Account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances. (See the definition of regulatory assets and liabilities.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.

      (9) The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts used to protect the utility from the risk of unfavorable price changes (“hedging transactions”) shall be deferred in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, or Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, as appropriate. Such deferred amounts shall be included in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, in the month in which the related allowances are acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of. Where the costs or benefits of hedging transactions are not identifiable with specific allowances, the amounts shall be included in Account 158.1 when the futures contract is closed. The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts entered into as a speculating activity shall be charged or credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.

      (v) —(1)  Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.

      (2)  Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, and other depreciation studies.

      (3)  Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.

      (w)  (1) Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for Account 209 so that the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account can be readily identified.

      (2) When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in Account 209 to avoid double counting of that amount.

      (3) When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets or 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, as appropriate.

      (x)  (1) Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics:

      (i) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.

      (ii) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.

      (iii) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

      (2) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in Account 175, Derivative instrument assets, or Account 244, Derivative Instrument Liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and losses recorded in Account 426.5, Other Deductions.

      (3) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.

      (4) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to Account 176, Derivatives in Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.

      (5) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in Account 176, Derivative Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same account or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earning in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.

      (y)  (1) An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

      (2) The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including Accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligation. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in Account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:

      (i) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, Account 413, Expenses of Electric Plant Leased to Others, for electric plant leased to others, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and crediting Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations; and

      (ii) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligation, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in Account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.

      (3) Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:

      (i) Gains shall be credited to Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, and;

      (ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant.

      (4) Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:

      (i) Gains shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and;

      (ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.

      (5) For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

      § 1767.16   Electric plant instructions.

#### § § 1767.16

      (a)  (1) The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.

      (2) The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the USoA in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a USoA, or under accounting practices previously followed.

      (3) The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from date of acquisition, shall be entered in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments.

      (4) Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under Sec. 1767.15(s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, as appropriate.

      (b)  (1) All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under § 1767.15 (s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Lease, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph (b).

      (2) When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, the definition of cost in § 1767.10). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish RUS the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.

      (3) When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.

      (4) The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a credit.

      (c)  The cost of construction properly includible in the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined hereunder:

      (1)  includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.

      (2)  includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes, and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder.

      (3)  includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

      (4)  includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See Item in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.)

      (5)  includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See Item in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.)

Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.

      (6) The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If, at the time of acquisition of an interest in land, such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and a cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of land is recorded.

      (7) When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.

      (8) Provisions shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interest in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof.

      (5) The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service.

      (i) The utility shall furnish RUS with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant.

      (ii) Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period.

      (j)  (1) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of retirement units and minor items of property.

      (2) The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:

      (i) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (ii) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.

      (3) The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:

      (i) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.

      (ii) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.

      (iii) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.

      (4) The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done, it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.

      (5) The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land accounts. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, when the property has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to Accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.

      (6) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to Account 108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant in Service. Any amounts which, by approval or order of RUS, are charged to Account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to Account 108.

      (7) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in Account 302, Franchises and Consents, and Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of Account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Utility Plant in Service; Account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant; and Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant.

      (k)  (1) Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.

      (2) Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.

      (3) Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.

      (l)  When property is transferred from one electric plant account to another, from one utility department to another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or area to another, to or from Account 101, Electric Plant in Service; Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and Account 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.

      (m)  (1) If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of RUS, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.”

      (2) The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in Account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in Accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in Paragraphs C and B of Accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to the detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.

      (3) The utility shall be prepared to show, at any time, and to report to RUS annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the book cost of common utility plant, the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and the basis of the allocation.

      (4) The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.

      (5) The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.

      (n)  For the purpose of this system of accounts:

      (1)  is all land, conversion structures, and equipment employed at a primary source of supply (i.e. generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) to change the voltage or frequency of electricity for the purpose of its more efficient or convenient transmission; all land, structures, lines, switching and conversion stations, high tension apparatus, and their control and protective equipment between a generating or receiving point and the entrance to a distribution center or wholesale point; and all lines and equipment whose primary purpose is to augment, integrate or tie together the sources of power supply.

      (2)  is all land, structures, conversion equipment, lines, line transformers, and other facilities employed between the primary source of supply (i.e. generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) and of delivery to customers, which are not includible in transmission system, as defined in Item in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, whether or not such land, structures, and facilities are operated as part of a transmission system or as part of a distribution system.

      (3) Where poles or towers support both transmission and distribution conductors, the poles, towers, anchors, guys, and rights-of-way shall be classified as transmission system. The conductors, cross-arms, braces, grounds, tiewire, and insulators shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities, according to the purpose for which used.

      (4) Where underground conduit contains both transmission and distribution conductors, the underground conduit and right-of-way shall be classified as distribution system. The conductors shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities according to the purpose for which used.

      (5) Land (other than rights-of-way) and structures used jointly for transmission and distribution purposes shall be classified as transmission or distribution according to the major use thereof.

      (o)  For purpose of this system of accounts hydraulic production plant is all land and land rights, structures and improvements used in connection with hydraulic power generation, reservoirs, dams and waterways, water wheels, turbines, generators, accessory electric equipment, roads, railroads, and bridges and structures and improvements used in connection with fish and wildlife, and recreation.

      (p)  Each utility shall keep all the necessary records to support the entries to the various nuclear fuel plant accounts classified under “Assets and Other Debits,” Utility Plant Accounts 120.1 through 120.5, inclusive; Account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense; and Account 157, Nuclear Materials Held for Sale. These records shall be so kept as to readily furnish the basis of the computation of the net nuclear fuel costs.

The provisions in this part require auditees to prepare and furnish to RUS, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, audited by an independent auditor that meets the requirements of § 1773.5, and performed in accordance with auditing standards issued by generally accepted Government auditing standards (GAGAS) and the requirements of § 1773.7.

      (b) This part is based on the requirements of GAGAS in effect at the time of the audit and applicable RUS regulations and subpart F (Audit Requirements) of 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) (2 CFR 200.500-200.521).

      (c) This part further sets forth the criteria that an auditee should use to select an auditor and certain audit procedures and audit documentation that must be performed and prepared by the auditor.

      (d) Failure of an auditee to provide audited financial statements in compliance with this part is a serious violation of the RUS security agreement. RUS relies on audited financial statements in order to assess and monitor the financial condition of its awardees and to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities.

      (e) RUS reserves the right to suspend its acceptance of audits performed by auditors who, in the opinion of RUS, are not meeting the requirements of this part or with unresolved disputes or issues until such time that the matter can be resolved to RUS' satisfaction.

    Subpart B—RUS Audit Requirements

      § 1773.3   Annual audit.

#### § § 1773.3

      (a) Each auditee must have its financial statements audited annually by an auditor selected by the auditee and approved by RUS as set forth in § 1773.4. All auditees, except those subject to the Single Audit Act, must submit audited financial statements on a comparative basis covering at least two consecutive 12-month periods, unless the entity has not been in existence for two consecutive 12-month audit periods. Financial statements should be prepared in accordance with GAAP, or if prepared using a special purpose framework, reconciling schedules should be included. Audits of consolidated financial statements of the parent are not an acceptable replacement for an audit of the auditee.

      (b) Each auditee must establish an annual audit date within 12 months of the date of the first advance and must prepare annual financial statements for the audit date established. Each auditee must notify RUS of the audit date at least 90 days prior to the selected audit date.

      (c) Auditees not subject to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must furnish a reporting package to RUS within 120 days of the audit date. (See § 1773.21) Until all loans made or guaranteed by RUS are repaid and unliquidated obligations rescinded, auditees must continue to provide annual audited financial statements. Auditees with grant funding only must furnish annual audited financial statements in the year of the first advance and until all funds have been advanced or rescinded, and all financial compliance requirements have been fully satisfied.

      (d) An auditee that is identified as a non-Federal entity as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, which means a State, local government, Indian tribe, Institution of Higher Education (IHE), or nonprofit organization that carries out a Federal award as a recipient or subrecipient, must meet the audit requirements outlined in 2 CFR 200.501 and 200.502 and the Single Audit Act, and not this part.

      (2) Within 30 days after the audit date, auditees subject to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must notify RUS, in writing via email, of the total Federal awards expended during the year and must state whether the audit will be performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act or this part.

      (e) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 does not apply to audits of RUS electric and telecommunications cooperatives and for-profit telecommunications awardees unless the awardee has contractually agreed with another Federal agency ( Federal Emergency Management Agency) to provide a financial audit performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. In no circumstance will an auditee be required to submit separate audits performed in accordance with this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

      § 1773.4   Auditee's responsibilities.

#### § § 1773.4

      (a)  The auditee's governance board is responsible for the selection of a qualified auditor that meets the requirements set forth in § 1773.5. When selecting an auditor, the auditee should consider, among other matters:

      (1) The qualifications of auditors available to do the work;

      (2) The auditor's experience in performing audits of utilities, related industries, or in the case of grantees, experience in auditing entities comparable to the grantee; and

      (3) The auditor's ability to complete the audit and submit the reporting package to the auditee within 90 days of the audit date.

      (b)  The board's approval of an auditor must be recorded by a board resolution that states:

      (1) The auditor represents that it meets RUS qualifications to perform an audit; and

      (2) The auditee and auditor will enter into an audit engagement in accordance with § 1773.6.

      (c)  When the initial selection or subsequent change of an auditor has been made, the auditee must notify RUS, in writing via email, at least 90 days prior to the audit date. Changes in the name of an auditor are considered to be a change in the auditor.

      (1) Within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice, RUS or its designated representative will notify the auditee, in writing via email, if the selection or change in auditor is not satisfactory based on criteria described in § 1773.5.

      (2) Notification that the same auditor has been selected for succeeding audits of the auditee's financial statements is not required; however, the procedures outlined in this part must be followed for each new auditor selected, even though such auditor may previously have been approved by RUS to audit records of other RUS auditees.

      (d)  The auditee must enter into an audit agreement with the auditor that complies with § 1773.6 prior to the initiation of the audit.

      (e)  The auditee must obtain, from the selected auditor, a lower tier covered transaction certification or other method in accordance with 2 CFR 180.300 or 2 CFR part 417, as required by Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 and any rules or regulations in this chapter issued thereunder.

      (f)  The auditee must obtain, from the selected auditor, a copy of the auditor's most recently accepted peer review report, which should be dated within 36 months of the engagement letter.

      (g)  The auditee must prepare any schedules that are required by the auditor to perform the audit, including a complete set of financial statements, a schedule of deferred debits and deferred credits and a detailed schedule of investments in subsidiary and affiliated companies accounted for on the cost, equity, or consolidated basis. The detailed schedule of investments can be included in the notes to the financial statements or as a separate schedule as long as all information required is adequately disclosed. If the auditee uses a method other than GAAP, reconciliation schedules should be included with the reporting package.

      (1) The schedule of deferred debits and deferred credits must include a description of the deferral and a notation as to whether the deferral has received written approval from RUS. If a determination is made that prior written approval is not required, cite the specific authority for the deferral.

      (2) The schedule of investments must include investments in subsidiary and affiliated companies, corporations, limited liability corporations and partnerships, joint ventures, etc. accounted for on either the cost, equity or on a consolidated basis. For all investments, the auditee must list the name of the entity, ownership percentage, and the principal business in which the entity is engaged. For investments recorded on the cost basis, the auditee must include the original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years and the net investment. For investments recorded on the equity or consolidated basis, the auditee must include the ownership percentage, original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years, and current and prior years' earnings and losses, including accumulated losses in excess of the original investment.

      (h)  The auditee will not limit the scope of the audit to the extent that the auditor is unable to provide an unmodified opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP due to the scope limitation.

      (i)  The auditee must submit to RUS, via the Agency designated system, the required reporting package as set forth in § 1773.21.

      (1) A reporting package that fails to meet the requirements detailed in this part will be returned to the auditee via email with a written explanation of noncompliance.

      (2) The auditee must, within 30 days of the date of the email detailing the noncompliance, submit a corrected reporting package to RUS via the Agency designated system.

      (3) If a corrected reporting package is not received within 30 days of the date of the email detailing the noncompliance, RUS will take appropriate action, depending on the severity of the noncompliance. Per § 1773.1(d), failure to provide an audit in compliance with this part is a serious violation of the RUS security agreement. RUS relies on audited financial statements to assess and monitor the financial condition of its awardees and to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities.

      (j)  If the auditor's report contains findings and recommendations but does not include the auditee's response, the auditee must submit written responses via email to RUS within 180 days of the audit date. The written responses must address:

      (1) The corrective action already taken or planned, or the reason the auditee believes no action is necessary; and

      (2) The status of corrective action taken on previously reported findings and recommendations.

      § 1773.5   Qualifications of the auditor.

#### § § 1773.5

      Auditors must meet the qualifications criteria of this section and enter into an audit engagement with the auditee that complies with § 1773.6 to be considered satisfactory to RUS.

      (a)  Auditors that audit the financial statements of an RUS auditee must be licensed to perform attestation engagements in the United States of America. Auditors do not have to be licensed by the state in which the auditee is located; however, auditors must abide by the rules and regulations of professional conduct promulgated by the accountancy board of the state in which the auditee is located.

      (b)  Auditors must be independent as determined by the standards for independence in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct and in GAGAS in effect at the time of the audit.

      (c)  Auditors must be enrolled in and comply with the requirements of an approved peer review program and must have undergone a satisfactory peer review of their accounting and audit practice. The peer review must be in effect at the date of the audit report opinion.

      (d)  RUS or its designated representative reserves the right to request peer review reports from selected auditors, including evidence indicating actions taken to correct deficiencies identified in the peer review report, if applicable.

      § 1773.6   Auditor communication.

#### § § 1773.6

      (a) Under GAGAS and AICPA professional auditing standards, the auditor should agree upon the terms of the engagement with management or those charged with governance, as appropriate. The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should be documented in an audit engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement. RUS requires the auditor's communication to take the form of an audit engagement letter prepared by the auditor and that it be formally accepted by the auditee's governance board or an audit committee representing the governance board. In addition to the requirements of the AICPA's professional auditing standards and GAGAS, the engagement letter must also include the following:

      (1) The nature of planned work and level of assurance to be provided related to internal control over financial reporting and compliance with laws, regulation, and provision of contracts or grant agreements;

      (2) That the auditee and auditor acknowledge that the audit is being performed and that the reporting package is being issued to enable the auditee to comply with the provisions of RUS's security instrument which requires compliance with this part;

      (j) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a reserve for bad debts. Reserves should be accumulated over a period of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the quality of the grant recipient's portfolio of loans. Unless the grant recipient provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of RUS, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over three years and then maintained as set forth in the grant agreement.

      (k) Any cash in the revolving loan fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to loan recipients.

      (l) All reserves and other cash in the revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to loan recipients or other authorized uses must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and must be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the revolving loan fund.

    § 1777.2   [Reserved]

#### § § 1777.2

    § 1777.3   Objective.

#### § § 1777.3

    The objective of the Section 306C Water and Waste Facility Loans and Grants to Alleviate Health Risks program is to provide water and waste disposal facilities and services to low-income rural areas whose residents are experiencing a significant health risk due to the fact that a significant proportion of the community's residents do not have access to, or are not served by, adequate affordable water supply systems or waste disposal facilities.

    § 1777.4   Definitions.

#### § § 1777.4

    The following definitions apply to this part:

    The Rural Utilities Service or its successors.

    The entity that has applied for assistance under this part. The entity may be a public body such as municipality, county, district, authority or other political subdivisions of a state, an organization operated on a not-for-profit basis such as an association, cooperative or private corporation, or a Federally Recognized Tribe as defined in the Federally Recognized Indian Tribal List Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791-4792). An entity operated on a not-for-profit basis must be controlled by a local public body or bodies or have a broadly based ownership by or membership of people of the local community.

    Any identifiable community designated in writing by a state, county or Federally Recognized Tribe in which it is located; determined to be a Colonia on the basis of objective criteria including lack of potable water supply, lack of adequate sewage systems, and lack of decent, safe, and sanitary housing, inadequate roads and drainage; and existed and was generally recognized as a Colonia before October 1, 1989. Colonia's eligible areas include the entire county where more than half of the area of the county is within 150 miles of the United States and Mexico border. The county governing body, state, or Tribal government must designate the respective communities in the county as _Colonia._ The individual Colonia still must meet all other qualifications. If only some of the counties within the 150-mile area are designated and a county is later designated, written evidence of Colonia designation must be placed in the respective files.

    A cooperative formed specifically for the purpose of the installation, expansion, improvement, or operation of water supply or waste disposal facilities or systems.

    The recipient of financial assistance for improvements to a private dwelling to facilitate the use of the water or waste disposal system.

    The income data used in this part to determine median household income must be that which most accurately reflects the income of the service area. The median household income of the service area and the Statewide Nonmetropolitan Median Household Income will be determined by 5-year income data from the United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. If there is reason to believe that the census data is not an accurate representation of the median household income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented and the applicant may furnish, or the Agency may obtain, additional information regarding such median household income. Information will consist of reliable data from local, regional, State, Tribal or Federal sources, or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source.

    Includes any city, town, or unincorporated area with a population not in excess of 10,000 inhabitants in any of the 50 States of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, according to the most recently implemented decennial census of the United States. If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recently implemented decennial census, the RUS Assistant Administrator for Water and Environmental Programs will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.

    Median household income of a state's nonmetropolitan counties and portions of metropolitan counties outside of cities, towns or places of 50,000 or more population. The SNMHI is set by the RUS Water and Environmental Program. The nonmetropolitan median household income of the State may only be updated on a national basis by the RUS National Office.

    Federally Recognized Tribes as defined in the Federally Recognized Indian Tribal List Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791-4792), as well as Tribal organizations, enterprises, authorities and utilities that are duly established pursuant to the Constitution and bylaws of such _Tribe._

#### § § 1777.12

    (a) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section apply to applications submitted by all eligible entities except for Colonias. The facility financed under this part must provide water and/or waste disposal services to rural areas where, on the date the application is received by the Agency, the:

    (1) Per capita income of the residents is not more than 70 percent of the most recently USDA implemented national average per capita income, as determined by 5-year income data from the United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau, ACS or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. If the RUS Assistant Administrator for Water and Environmental Program (WEP) has reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the per capita income of the residents, the reasons will be documented and the applicant may furnish, or the Agency may obtain, additional information regarding such per capita income data. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, state, Tribal or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source, and,

    (2) Unemployment rate of the residents is not less than 125 percent of the most recent national average unemployment rate, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    (3) Projects for which the applicant is not a Federally Recognized Tribe, but which will benefit Tribal members, may be considered eligible for funds under this part if the applicant provides acceptable documentation and certifies that more than 50 percent of the users in the project service area are members of Tribes. In such cases, funds awarded under this part cannot exceed the applicable percentage of the total eligible project cost. If the applicant is not a Tribe, the applicant must solicit a resolution or letter of consent in support of the application from the benefiting Tribe.

    (b) Residents of the rural area to be served must be experiencing a significant health risk due to the fact that a significant proportion of the community's residents do not have access to, or are not served by, adequate, affordable, water supply systems and/or waste disposal facilities. The Agency's records must clearly document and support this determination. The following requirements regarding the documentation must be followed:

    (1) The originating documentation must come from an independent third-party source that has the experience in specifying the health or sanitary problem that currently exists.

    (2) The documentation must state specifically the health or sanitary problems that exist. General statements of problems or support for the project are not acceptable.

    (3) Current users of the facility, and not future or possible users, must be experiencing the current health or sanitary problem.

    (4) If no facility exists, documentation must include specific health and sanitary problems associated with individual facilities that currently exist to warrant the health and sanitary determination.

    (5) In instances where eligible applicants are proposing to finance water or waste disposal infrastructure improvements addressing health and sanitary problems and that will help alleviate overcrowding or lack of housing, the applicant must provide adequate plans that reasonably demonstrate that the new housing development will be fully financed and will be completed once the infrastructure is completed.

    § 1777.13   Public infrastructure—Use of funds.

#### § § 1777.13

    § 1777.14   Public infrastructure—Application processing and scoring.

#### § § 1777.14

    (a)  RUS may retain funds at the National Office or may allocate funds to Rural Development (RD) State Offices. Funds allocated to RD State Offices that remain unobligated may be pooled at the National Office's discretion and made available to any RD State Offices with eligible applications on a case-by-case basis. The application and supporting information submitted with it will be used to determine applicant eligibility and scoring for available funds. Applicants that do not receive an award will be advised of their appeal rights in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. Paragraph (c) of this section indicates items and conditions which will be considered in selecting applications for funding. When ranking eligible applications for consideration of limited funds, Agency officials will consider the scoring criteria met by each application and the degree to which those criteria are met.

    (b)  Applications should be submitted in accordance with 7 CFR 1780. For funds retained at RUS National Office, applications will be processed, scored, and reviewed for funding priority by the processing office and then submitted for consideration to the RUS National Office. It is preferred that applications be submitted electronically through RD Apply or its successor platforms. Where electronic application is not feasible, an application can be submitted physically to the local processing office. Information relating to the local processing office may be found at  For funds allocated to RD state offices, the respective office will process, score, and fund projects with the available allocation. Projects that cannot be fully funded within the allocation will be considered in accordance with funds retained at the RUS National Office on a project-by-project basis. The Agency reserves the right to make no award if: no funding is received, or all applications are ineligible, incomplete, or do not meet the established program objectives and priorities. The Agency may determine that the application is:

    (1) Eligible and selected for funding,

    (2) Eligible but offered less funds than requested,

    (3) Eligible but not selected for funding due to ranking of all applications by score, or

    (4) Ineligible for funding.

    A significant decline in quality of potable water occurs when the present community source or delivery system does not meet, as a result of an emergency, the current SDWA requirements. For a private source or delivery system a significant decline in quality occurs when the water is no longer potable as a result of an emergency. As used in this Subpart, the term significant decline in quality may also include a situation where a significant decline is likely to occur within one year from the date of the filing of an application.

    A significant decline in the quantity is caused by a disruption of the potable water supply by an emergency. The disruption in quantity of water prevents the present source or delivery system from supplying potable water needs to rural residents. This would not include a decline in excess water capacity. As used in this Subpart, the term significant decline in quantity may also include a situation where a significant decline is likely to occur within one year from the date of the filing of an application.

      § 1780.7   Eligibility.

#### § § 1780.7

      Facilities financed by water and waste disposal loans or grants must serve rural areas.

      (a)  An applicant must be:

      (1) A public body, such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a state, territory or commonwealth;

      (2) An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis, such as an association, cooperative, or private corporation. The organization must be an association controlled by a local public body or bodies, or have a broadly based ownership by or membership of people of the local community; or

      (3) Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other Federally recognized Indian tribes.

      (b)  Facilities financed by RUS may be located in non-rural areas. However, loan and grant funds may be used to finance only that portion of the facility serving rural areas, regardless of facility location.

      (c)  (1) Projects must serve a rural area which, if such project is completed, is not likely to decline in population below that for which the project was designed.

      (2) Projects must be designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area to the extent practicable.

      (3) Projects must be necessary for orderly community development and consistent with a current comprehensive community water, waste disposal, or other current development plan for the rural area.

      (d)  Applicants must certify in writing and the Agency shall determine and document that the applicant is unable to finance the proposed project from their own resources or through commercial credit at reasonable rates and terms.

      (e)  Each applicant must have or will obtain the legal authority necessary for owning, constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed facility or service and for obtaining, giving security for, and repaying the proposed loan. The applicant shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility, and providing for its continued availability and use at reasonable user rates and charges. This responsibility shall be exercised by the applicant even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract or management agreement. Guidance for preparing a management agreement is available from the Agency. Such contracts, management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership.

      (f)  All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments, income, fees, or other satisfactory sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, reasonable reserves, and debt payment. If the primary use of the facility is by business and the success or failure of the facility is dependent on the business, then the economic viability of that business must be assessed.

      (g)  An outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, shall cause the applicant to be ineligible to receive a loan or grant until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied.

      (iii) Purchasing or renting equipment necessary to install, operate, maintain, extend, or protect facilities;

      (iv) Cost of additional applicant labor and other expenses necessary to install and extend service; and

      (v) In unusual cases, the cost for connecting the user to the main service line.

      (2) Only loan funds may be used for:

      (i) Interest incurred during construction in conjunction with multiple advances or interest on interim financing;

      (ii) Initial operating expenses, including interest, for a period ordinarily not exceeding one year when the applicant is unable to pay such expenses;

      (iii) The purchase of existing facilities when it is necessary either to improve service or prevent the loss of service;

      (iv) Refinancing debts incurred by, or on behalf of, an applicant when all of the following conditions exist:

      (A) The debts being refinanced are a secondary part of the total loan;

      (B) The debts were incurred for the facility or service being financed or any part thereof; and

      (C) Arrangements cannot be made with the creditors to extend or modify the terms of the debts so that a sound basis will exist for making a loan; and

      (3) Grant funds may be used to restore loan funds used to prepay grant obligated costs.

      (f) Construction incurred before loan or grant approval.

      (1) Funds may be used to pay obligations for eligible project costs incurred before loan or grant approval if such requests are made in writing by the applicant and the Agency determines that:

      (i) Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before loan or grant approval;

      (ii) The obligations will be incurred for authorized loan or grant purposes; and

      (iii) The Agency's authorization to pay such obligations is on the condition that it is not committed to make the loan or grant; it assumes no responsibility for any obligations incurred by the applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all loan or grant approval requirements, including environmental and contracting requirements.

      (2) If construction is started without Agency approval, post-approval in accordance with this section may be considered, provided the construction meets applicable requirements including those regarding approval and environmental matters.

      (g) Water or sewer service may be provided through individual installations or small clusters of users within an applicant's service area. The approval official should consider items such as: quantity and quality of the individual installations that may be developed; cost effectiveness of the individual facility compared with the initial and long term user cost on a central system; health and pollution problems attributable to individual facilities; operational or management problems peculiar to individual installations; and permit and regulatory agency requirements.

      (1) Applicants providing service through individual facilities must meet the eligibility requirements in § 1780.7.

      (2) The Agency must approve the form of agreement between the applicant and individual users for the installation, operation, maintenance and payment for individual facilities.

      (3) If taxes or assessments are not pledged as security, applicants providing service through individual facilities must obtain security necessary to assure collection of any sum the individual user is obligated to pay the applicant.

      (4) Notes representing indebtedness owed the applicant by a user for an individual facility will be scheduled for payment over a period not to exceed the useful life of the individual facility or the RUS loan, whichever is shorter. The interest rate will not exceed the interest rate charged the applicant on the RUS indebtedness.

      (5) Applicants providing service through individual or cluster facilities must obtain:

      (i) Easements for the installation and ingress to and egress from the facility if determined necessary by RUS; and

      (ii) An adequate method for denying service in the event of nonpayment of user fees.

      (h) A borrower is permitted to use up to 10 percent of the amount provided under this part to construct, improve, or acquire broadband infrastructure related to the project financed, subject to the requirements of 7 CFR part 1980, subpart M.

      § 1780.10   Limitations.

#### § § 1780.10

      (a) Loan and grant funds may not be used to finance:

      (1) Facilities which are not modest in size, design, and cost;

      (2) Loan or grant finder's fees;

      (3) The construction of any new combined storm and sanitary sewer facilities;

      (4) Any portion of the cost of a facility which does not serve a rural area;

      (5) That portion of project costs normally provided by a business or industrial user, such as wastewater pretreatment, etc.;

      (6) Rental for the use of equipment or machinery owned by the applicant;

      (7) For other purposes not directly related to operating and maintenance of the facility being installed or improved; and

      (8) A judgment which would disqualify an applicant for a loan or grant as provided for in § 1780.7(g).

      (b) Grant funds may not be used to:

      (1) Reduce EDU costs to a level less than similar system cost;

      (2) Pay any costs of a project when the median household income of the service area is more than 100 percent of the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State;

      (3) Pay project costs when other loan funding for the project is not at reasonable rates and terms; and

      (4) Pay project costs when other funding is a guaranteed loan obtained in accordance with 7 CFR part 1779 of this title.

      (c) Grants may not be made in excess of the following percentages of the RUS eligible project development costs. Facilities previously installed will not be considered in determining the development costs.

      (1) 75 percent when the median household income of the service area is below the higher of the poverty line or 80% of the state nonmetropolitan median income and the project is necessary to alleviate a health or sanitary problem.

      (2) 45 percent when the median household income of the service area exceeds the 80 percent requirements described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section but is not more than 100 percent of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.

      (3) Applicants are advised that the percentages contained in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section are maximum amounts and may be further limited due to availability of funds or the grant determination procedures contained in § 1780.35 (b).

> [62 FR 33478, June 19, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 29946, June 4, 1999; 66 FR 23151, May 8, 2001]

      § 1780.11   Service area requirements.

#### § § 1780.11

      (a) All facilities financed under the provisions of this part shall be for public use. The facilities will be installed so as to serve any potential user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served. This does not preclude:

      (1) Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and

      (2) Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to or parts thereof; the applicant publicly announces a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service from the system; and potential users located in the areas not to be initially served receive written notice from the applicant that service will not be provided until such time as it is economically feasible to do so.

      (b) Should the Agency determine that inequities exist within the applicants service area for the same type service proposed (i.e., water or waste disposal) such inequities will be remedied by the applicant prior to loan or grant approval or included as part of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems that were developed under different financing, rates, terms or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.

      (c) Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in new or developing areas in compliance with appropriate State statutes. RUS financing will be considered to an eligible applicant only in such cases when failure to complete development would result in an adverse economic condition for the rural area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to the success of a current area development plan; and loan repayment can be assured by:

      (1) The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to repay the loan; or

      (2) Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements. Such guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in § 1780.39(c)(4)(ii); or

      (3) Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the increased costs; or

      (4) The full faith and credit of a public body where the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; or

      (5) The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax revenue or assessments; or

      (6) The user charges can become a lien upon the property being served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to be used for its intended purposes.

      § 1780.12   [Reserved]

#### § § 1780.12

      § 1780.13   Rates and terms.

#### § § 1780.13

      (a)  (1) Each loan will bear interest at the rate prescribed in RD Instruction 440.1, exhibit B. The interest rates will be set by the Agency for each quarter of the fiscal year. All rates will be adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one per centum. The rate will be the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or the rate in effect at the time of loan closing unless the applicant otherwise chooses.

      (2) If the interest rate is to be that in effect at loan closing on a loan involving multiple advances of RUS funds using temporary debt instruments, the interest rate charged shall be that in effect on the date when the first temporary debt instrument is issued.

      (3) For a loan for a specific project that has been approved, but not closed on or before May 22, 2008, the rate structure in effect at that time will determine the interest rates. For loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, a percentage of the market rate will be used to determine the poverty and intermediate interest rates.

      (b)  The poverty interest rate will not exceed 5 per centum per annum. Loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, will have the poverty interest rate set at 60 percent of the market rate. All poverty rate loans must comply with the following conditions:

      (1) The primary purpose of the loan is to upgrade existing facilities or construct new facilities required to meet applicable health or sanitary standards; and

      (2) The median household income of the service area is below the higher of the poverty line, or 80 percent of the Statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.

      (c)  The intermediate interest rate will not exceed 7 percent per annum. For a loan for a specific project that has been approved, but not closed on or before May 22, 2008, the intermediate rate is the poverty rate plus one-half of the difference between the poverty rate and the market rate, not to exceed 7 percent per annum. Loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, will have the intermediate interest rate set at 80 percent of the market rate. The intermediate interest rate will apply to loans that do not meet the requirements for the poverty rate and for which the median household income of the service area is not more than 100 percent of the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State.

      (d)  The market interest rate will be set using as guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index (available in any Agency office or the program's Web site) for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter. The market rate will apply to all loans that do not qualify for a different rate under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

      (e)  The loan repayment period shall not exceed the useful life of the facility, State statute or 40 years from the date of the note or bond, whichever is less. Where RUS grant funds are used in connection with an RUS loan, the loan will be for the maximum term permitted by this part, State statute, or the useful life of the facility, whichever is less, unless there is an exceptional case where circumstances justify making an RUS loan for less than the maximum term permitted. In such cases, the reasons must be fully documented.

      (1) Principal payments may be deferred in whole or in part for a period not to exceed 36 months following the date the first interest installment is due. If for any reason it appears necessary to permit a longer period of deferment, the Agency may authorize such deferment. Deferments of principal will not be used to:

      (i) Postpone the levying of taxes or assessments;

      (ii) Delay collection of the full rates which the borrower has agreed to charge users for its services as soon as those services become available;

      (iii) Create reserves for normal operation and maintenance;

      (iv) Make any capital improvements except those approved by the Agency which are determined to be essential to the repayment of the loan or to maintain adequate security; and

      (v) Make payment on other debt.

      (2)  Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law. If State law only permits principal plus interest (P&I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used. Insofar as practical monthly payments will be scheduled one full month following the date of loan closing; or semiannual or annual payments will be scheduled six or twelve full months, respectively, following the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of the month will be avoided.

      (3) In all cases, including those in which RUS is jointly financing with another lender, the RUS payments of principal and interest should approximate amortized installments.

> [62 FR 33478, June 19, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 395, Jan. 6, 2009; 82 FR 43671, Sept. 19, 2017]

      § 1780.14   Security.

#### § § 1780.14

      Loans will be secured by the best security position practicable in a manner which will adequately protect the interest of RUS during the repayment period of the loan. Specific security requirements for each loan will be included in a letter of conditions.

      (a)  Loans to such borrowers, including Federally recognized Indian tribes as appropriate, will be evidenced by notes, bonds, warrants, or other contractual obligations as may be authorized by relevant laws and by borrower's documents, resolutions, and ordinances. Security, in the following order of preference, will consist of:

      (1) The full faith and credit of the borrower when the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; and/or

      (2) Pledges of taxes or assessments; and/or

      (3) Pledges of facility revenue and, when it is the customary financial practice in the State, liens will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts, and similar property rights, including leasehold interests, used or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds.

      (b)  Loans to other-than-public body applicants and Federally recognized Indian tribes, as appropriate, will be secured in the following order of preference:

      (1) Assignments of borrower income will be taken and perfected by filing, if legally permissible; and

      (2) A lien will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used, or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds. In unusual circumstances where it is not legally permissible or feasible to obtain a lien on such land (such as land rights obtained from Federal or local government agencies, and from railroads) and the approval official determines that the interest of RUS is otherwise adequately secured, the lien requirement may be omitted as to such land rights. For existing borrowers where the Agency already has a security position on real property, the approval official may determine that the interest of the Government is adequately secured and not require additional liens on such land rights. When the subsequent loan is approved or the acquisition of real property is subject to an outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority lien obtainable will be taken if the approval official determines that the loan is adequately secured.

      (c)  For projects utilizing joint financing, when adequate security of more than one type is available, the other lender may take one type of security with RUS taking another type. For projects utilizing joint financing with the same security to be shared by RUS and another lender, RUS will obtain at least a parity position with the other lender. A parity position is to ensure that with joint security, in the event of default, each lender will be affected on a proportionate basis. A parity position will conform with the following unless an exception is granted by the approval official:

      (1) It is not necessary for loans to have the same repayment terms. Loans made by other lenders involved in joint financing with RUS should be scheduled for repayment on terms similar to those customarily used in the State for financing such facilities.

      (2) The use of a trustee or other similar paying agent by the other lender in a joint financing arrangement is acceptable to RUS. A trustee or other similar paying agent will not normally be used for the RUS portion of the funding unless required to comply with State law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other similar paying agent on projects that include RUS funds must be clearly specified by written agreement and approved by the State program official and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). RUS must be able to deal directly with the borrower to enforce the provisions of loan and grant agreements and perform necessary servicing actions.

      (3) In the event adequate funds are not available to meet regular installments on parity loans, the funds available will be apportioned to the lenders based on the respective current installments of principal and interest due.

      (4) Funds obtained from the sale or liquidation of secured property or fixed assets will be apportioned to the lenders on the basis of the pro rata amount outstanding; provided, however, funds obtained from such sale or liquidation for a project that included RUS grant funds will be apportioned as required by the grant agreement.

      (5) Protective advances must be charged to the borrower's account and be secured by a lien on the security property. To the extent consistent with State law and customary lending practices in the area, repayment of protective advances made by either lender, for the mutual protection of both lenders, should receive first priority in apportionment of funds between the lenders. To ensure agreement between lenders, efforts should be made to obtain the concurrence of both lenders before one lender makes a protective advance.

      § 1780.15   Other Federal, State, and local requirements.

#### § § 1780.15

      Proposals for facilities financed in whole or in part with RUS funds will be coordinated with appropriate Federal, State and local agencies. If there are conflicts between this part and State or local laws or regulatory commission regulations, the provisions of this part will control. Applicants will be required to comply with Federal, State, and local laws and any regulatory commission rules and regulations pertaining to:

      (a) Organization of the applicant and its authority to own, construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facilities;

      (b) Borrowing money, giving security therefore, and raising revenues for the repayment thereof;

      (c) Land use zoning; and

      (d) Health and sanitation standards and design and installation standards unless an exception is granted by RUS.

#### § § 1780.16

      § 1780.17   Selection priorities and process.

#### § § 1780.17

      When ranking eligible applications for consideration for limited funds, Agency officials must consider the priority items met by each application and the degree to which those priorities are met. Points will be awarded as follows:

      (a)  (1) The proposed project will primarily serve a rural area having a population not in excess of 1,000—25 points;

      (2) The proposed project primarily serves a rural area having a population between 1,001 and 2,500—15 points;

      (3) The proposed project primarily serves a rural area having a population between 2,501 and 5,500—5 points.

      (b)  The proposed project is:

      (1) Needed to alleviate an emergency situation, correct unanticipated diminution or deterioration of a water supply, or to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements which pertain to a water system—25 points;

      (2) Required to correct inadequacies of a wastewater disposal system, or to meet health standards which pertain to a wastewater disposal system—25 points;

      (3) Required to meet administrative orders issued to correct local, State, or Federal solid waste violations—15 points.

      (c)  The median household income of the population to be served by the proposed project is:

      (1) Less than the poverty line if the poverty line is less than 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income—30 points;

      (2) Less than 80 percent of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income—20 points;

      (3) Equal to or more than the poverty line and between 80% and 100%, inclusive, of the State's nonmetropolitan median household income—15 points.

      (d)  (1) The proposed project will: merge ownership, management, and operation of smaller facilities providing for more efficient management and economical service—15 points;

      (2) The proposed project will enlarge, extend, or otherwise modify existing facilities to provide service to additional rural areas—10 points;

      (3) Applicant is a public body or Indian tribe—5 points;

      (4) Amount of other than RUS funds committed to the project is:

      (i) 50% or more—15 points;

      (ii) 20% to 49%—10 points;

      (iii) 5%—19%—5 points;

      (5) Projects that will serve Agency identified target areas—10 points;

      (6) Projects that primarily recycle solid waste products thereby limiting the need for solid waste disposal—5 points;

      (7) The proposed project will serve an area that has an unreliable quality or supply of drinking water—10 points.

      (e) In certain cases the State program official may assign up to 15 points to a project. The points may be awarded to projects in order to improve compatibility and coordination between RUS's and other agencies' selection systems, to ensure effective RUS fund utilization, and to assist those projects that are the most cost effective. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file each time these points are assigned.

      (f)  An application may receive consideration for funding before others at the State or National Office level when it is a subsequent request for a previously approved project which has encountered construction cost overruns. The cost overruns must be due to high bids or unexpected construction problems that cannot be reduced by negotiations, redesign, use of bid alternatives, rebidding or other means. Cost overruns exceeding 20% of the development cost at time of loan or grant approval or where the scope of the original purpose has changed will not be considered under this paragraph.

      (g)  In selecting projects for funding at the National Office level State program official points may or may not be considered. The Administrator may assign up to 15 additional points to account for items such as geographic distribution of funds, the highest priority projects within a state, and emergency conditions caused by economic problems or natural disasters. The Administrator may delegate the authority to assign the 15 points to appropriate National Office staff.

      § 1780.18   Allocation of program funds.

#### § § 1780.18

      (a)  (1) The purpose of this part is to set forth the methodology and formulas by which the Administrator of the RUS allocates program funds to the States. (The term “State” means any of the States of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or the Western Pacific Areas.)

      (2) The formulas in this part are used to allocate program loan and grant funds to Rural Development State offices so that the overall mission of the Agency can be carried out. Considerations used when developing the formulas include enabling legislation, congressional direction, and administration policies. Allocation formulas ensure that program resources are available on an equal basis to all eligible individuals and organizations.

      (3) The actual amounts of funds, as computed by the methodology and formulas contained herein, allocated to a State for a funding period, are distributed to each State office. The allocated amounts are available for review in any Rural Development State office.

      (b) —(1)  Funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Agency for use in authorized programs. On occasion, the allocation of funds to States may not be practical for a particular program due to funding or administrative constraints. In these cases, funds will be controlled by the National Office.

      (2)  Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic State factor as a part of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a particular program and through a normalization and weighting process for each of the criteria calculate the basic State factor (SF). The data sources used for each criteria are believed to be the most current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative value to the importance of each of the criteria.

      (3)  The result of multiplying the amount available for allocation less the total of any amounts held in reserve or distributed by base or administrative allocation times the basic State factor for each State. The basic formula allocation (BFA) for an individual State is equal to:

      (4)  (i) A formula based on a proportional amount of previous year allocation used to maintain program continuity by preventing large fluctuations in individual State allocations. The transition formula limits allocation shifts to any particular State in the event of changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula first checks whether the current year's basic formula allocation is within the transition range (plus or minus 20 percentage points of the proportional amount of the previous year's BFA). The formula follows:

      (ii) If the current year's State BFA is not within the transition range in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the State formula allocation is changed to the amount of the transition range limit closest to the BFA amount. After having performed this transition adjustment for each State, the sum of the funds allocated to all States will differ from the amount of funds available for BFA. This difference, whether a positive or negative amount, is distributed to all States receiving a formula allocation by multiplying the difference by the SF. The end result is the transition formula allocation. The transition range will not exceed 40% (plus or minus 20%), but when a smaller range is used it will be stated in the individual program section.

      (5)  An amount that may be allocated to each State dependent upon the particular program to provide the opportunity for funding at least one typical loan or grant in each Rural Development State office. The amount of the base allocation may be determined by criteria other than that used in the basic formula allocation such as Agency historic data.

      (6)  Allocations made by the Administrator in cases where basic formula criteria information is not available. This form of allocation may be used when the Administrator determines the program objectives cannot be adequately met with a formula allocation.

      (7)  An amount retained under the National Office control for each loan and grant program to provide flexibility in meeting situations of unexpected or justifiable need occurring during the fiscal year. The Administrator may make distributions from this reserve to any State when it is determined necessary to meet a program need or Agency objective. The Administrator may retain additional amounts to fund authorized demonstration programs.

      (8)  A technique used to ensure that available funds are used in an effective, timely and efficient manner. At the time of pooling those funds within a State's allocation for the fiscal year or portion of the fiscal year, depending on the type of pooling, that have not been obligated by the State are placed in the National Office reserve. The Administrator will establish the pooling dates for each affected program.

      (i) Mid-year: Mid-year pooling occurs near the midpoint of the fiscal year.

      (ii) Year-end: Year-end pooling usually occurs near the first of August.

      (iii) Emergency: The Administrator may pool funds at any time that it is determined the conditions upon the initial allocation was based have changed to such a degree that it is necessary to pool funds in order to efficiently carry out the Agency mission.

      (9)  Program funds are made available to the Agency on a quarterly basis.

      (10)  The State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the State allocation to processing offices. When suballocating the State Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State office reserve to provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula, criteria and weights as used by the National Office.

      (c) —(1)  See paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (2)  See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (i) The criteria used in the basic formula are:

      (A) State's percentage of national rural population will be 50 percent.

      (B) State's percentage of national rural population with income below the poverty level will be 25 percent.

      (C) State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment will be 25 percent.

      (ii) The data sources for each criterion identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed 0.05, as follows:

      (A) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the most recent decennial Census data.

      (B) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS).

      (C) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the 5-year data from the ACS.

      (3)  See paragraph (b)(3) of this section. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive formula allocations.

      (4)  See paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The percentage range for the transition formula equals 30 percent (plus or minus 15%).

      (5)  See paragraph (b)(5) of this section. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive base allocations.

      (6)  See paragraph (b)(6) of this section. States participating in the formula and base allocation procedures do not receive administrative allocations.

      (7)  See paragraph (b)(7) of this section. Any State may request reserve funds by forwarding a request to the National Office. Generally, a request for additional funds will not be honored unless the State has insufficient funds to obligate the loan requested.

      (8)  See paragraph (b)(8) of this section. Funds are generally pooled at mid-year and year-end. Pooled funds will be placed in the National Office reserve and will be made available administratively.

      (9)  See paragraph (b)(9) of this section. The allocation of funds is made available for States to obligate on an annual basis although the Office of Management and Budget apportions it to the Agency on a quarterly basis.

      (10)  See paragraph (b)(10) of this section. The State Director has the option to suballocate funds to processing offices.

    Subpart B—Loan and Grant Application Processing

      § 1780.31   General.

#### § § 1780.31

      (a) Applicants are encouraged to contact the Agency processing office early in the planning stages of their project. Agency personnel are available to provide general advice and assistance regarding RUS programs, other funding sources, and types of systems or improvements appropriate for the applicants needs. The Agency can also provide access to technical assistance and other information resources for other project development issues such as public information, income surveys, developing rate schedules, system operation and maintenance, and environmental compliance requirements. Throughout the planning, application processing and construction of the project, Agency personnel will work closely and cooperatively with the applicant and their representatives, other State and Federal agencies and technical assistance providers.

      (b) The processing office will handle initial inquiries and provide basic information about the program. They are to provide the application, SF 424.2, “Application for Federal Assistance (For Construction),” assist applicants as needed in completing SF 424.2, and in filing a request for intergovernmental review. Federally recognized Indian tribes are exempt from intergovernmental review. The processing office will explain eligibility requirements and meet with the applicant whenever necessary to discuss application processing.

      (c) Applicants can make a written request for an eligibility determination in lieu of filing an SF 424.2 along with the information required by § 1780.33. Applicants seeking only an eligibility determination, should contact the processing office to obtain a list of the items needed to make this determination. An eligibility determination for loan or grant assistance will not give an applicant priority for funding as set forth in § 1780.17.

      (d) Applications that are not developed in a reasonable period of time taking into account the size and complexity of the proposed project may be removed from the State's active file. Applicants will be consulted prior to taking such action.

      (e) During the earliest discussion with prospective applicants, the Agency will advise prospective applicants on environmental review requirements and evaluation of potential environmental impacts of the proposal. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, environmental review requirements shall be performed by the applicant simultaneously and concurrently with the proposal's engineering planning and design.

      (2) The processing office will forward one copy of the PER with comments and recommendations to the State staff engineer for review upon receipt from the applicant.

      (3) The State staff engineer will consult with the applicant's engineer as appropriate to resolve any questions concerning the PER. Written comments will be provided by the State staff engineer to the processing office to meet eligibility determination time lines.

      (d) Written certification that other credit is not available.

      (e) Supporting documentation necessary to make an eligibility determination such as financial statements, audits, organizational documents, or existing debt instruments. The processing office will advise applicants regarding the required documents. Applicants that are indebted to RUS will not need to submit documents already on file with the processing office.

      (f)  The applicant must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.

      (1) Upon receipt of the Environmental Report, the processing office shall forward one copy of the report with comments and recommendation to the State Environmental Coordinator for review.

      (2) The State Environmental Coordinator will consult with the applicant as appropriate to resolve any environmental concerns. Written comments will be provided by the State Environmental Coordinator to the processing office to meet eligibility determination time lines.

      (g) The applicant's Internal Revenue Service Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The TIN will be used by the Agency to assign a case number which will be the applicant's or transferee's TIN preceded by State and County Code numbers. Only one case number will be assigned to each applicant regardless of the number of loans or grants or number of separate facilities, unless an exception is authorized by the National Office.

      (h) Other Forms and certifications. Applicants will be required to submit the following items to the processing office, upon notification from the processing office to proceed with further development of the full application:

      § 1780.35   Processing office review.

#### § § 1780.35

      Review of the application will usually include the following:

      (a)  Boundaries for the proposed service area must not be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or national origin. This does not preclude construction of the project in phases as noted in § 1780.11 as long as it is not done in a discriminatory manner.

      (b)  Grants will be determined by the processing office in accordance with the following provisions and will not result in EDU costs below similar system user cost.

      (1)  Grants may not exceed the percentages in § 1780.10(c) of the eligible RUS project development costs listed in § 1780.9.

      (2)  Applicants will be considered for grant assistance when the debt service portion of the average annual EDU cost, for users in the applicant's service area, exceeds the following percentages of median household income:

      (i) 0.5 percent when the median household income of the service area is equal to or below 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median income.

      (ii) 1.0 percent when the median household income of the service area exceeds the 0.5 percent requirement but is not more than 100 percent the statewide nonmetropolitan household income.

      (3)  If the grant determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section results in an annual EDU cost that is not comparable with similar systems, the Agency will determine a grant amount based on achieving EDU costs that are not below similar system user costs.

      (4)  When an applicant provides wholesale sales or services on a contract basis to another system or entity, similar wholesale system cost will be used in determining the amount of grant needed to achieve a reasonable wholesale user cost.

      (5)  When annual cost to the applicant for delivery of service is subsidized by either the state, commonwealth, or territory, and uniform flat user charges regardless of usage are imposed for similar classes of service throughout the service area, the Agency may proceed with a grant in an amount necessary to reduce such delivery cost to a reasonable level.

      (c)  The user charges should be reasonable and produce enough revenue to provide for all costs of the facility after the project is complete. The planned revenue should be sufficient to provide for all debt service, debt reserve, operation and maintenance, and, if appropriate, additional revenue for facility replacement of short-lived assets without building a substantial surplus. Ordinarily, the total debt service reserve will be equal to one average annual loan installment which will accumulate at the rate of one-tenth of the total each year.

      § 1780.36   Approving official review.

#### § § 1780.36

      Projects may be obligated as their applications are completed and approved.

      (a)  The application and supporting information submitted will be used to determine the applications selected for further development and funding. After completing the review, the approval official will normally select those eligible applications with the highest priority scores for further processing. When authorizing the development of an application for funding, the following will be considered:

      (1) Funds available in State allocation;

      (2) Anticipated allocation of funds for the next fiscal year; and

      (3) Time necessary for applicant to complete the application.

      (b)  (1) In cases where preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible, high scoring application is unfeasible or would require an amount of funding from RUS that exceeds either 25 percent of a State's current annual allocation or an amount greater than that remaining in the State's allocation, the approval official may instead select the next lower scoring application for further processing provided the high scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an opportunity to revise the proposal and resubmit it.

      (2) If it is found that there is no effective way to reduce costs or no other funding sources, the approval official, after consultation with applicant, may submit a request for an additional allocation of funds for the proposed project to the National Office. The request should be submitted during the fiscal year in which obligation is anticipated. Such request will be considered along with all others on hand. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file.

      § 1780.37   Applications determined ineligible.

#### § § 1780.37

      If at any time an application is determined ineligible, the processing office will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons. The notification to the applicant will state that an appeal of this decision may be made by the applicant under 7 CFR part 11.

      § 1780.38   [Reserved]

#### § § 1780.38

      § 1780.39   Application processing.

#### § § 1780.39

      (a)  Before starting to assemble the full application, the applicant should arrange through the processing office an application conference to provide a basis for orderly application assembly. The processing office will explain program requirements, public information requirements and provide guidance on preparation of items necessary for approval.

      (b)  Fees provided for in contracts or agreements shall be reasonable. The Agency shall consider fees to be reasonable if they are not in excess of those ordinarily charged by the profession as a whole for similar work when RUS financing is not involved. Applicants will be responsible for providing the services necessary to plan projects including design of facilities, environmental review and documentation requirements, preparation of cost and income estimates, development of proposals for organization and financing, and overall operation and maintenance of the facility. Applicants should negotiate for procurement of professional services, whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiations of fair and reasonable compensation. Contracts or other forms of agreement between the applicant and its professional and technical representatives are required and are subject to RUS concurrence.

      (1)  (i) Applicants shall publicly announce all requirements for engineering and architectural services, and negotiate contracts for engineering and architectural services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services required and at a fair and reasonable price.

      (ii) When project design services are procured separately, the selection of the engineer or architect shall be done by requesting qualification-based proposals and in accordance with this section.

      (iii) Applicants may procure engineering and architectural services in accordance with applicable State statutes or local requirements provided the State Director determines that such procurement meets the intent of this section.

      (2)  Professional services of the following may be necessary: Attorney, bond counsel, accountant, auditor, appraiser, environmental professionals, and financial advisory or fiscal agent (if desired by applicant). Guidance on entering into an agreement for legal services is available from the Agency.

      (3)  Unless otherwise provided by subpart D of this part, public bodies are required to obtain the service of recognized bond counsel in the preparation of evidence of indebtedness.

      (4)  Contracts or other forms of agreements for other services including management, operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to the Agency for review and concurrence. Guidance on entering into a management agreement is available from the Agency.

      (c)  Applicants dependent on users fees for debt payment or operation and maintenance expenses shall base their income and expense forecast on realistic user estimates. For users presently not receiving service, consideration must be given to the following:

      (1) An estimated number of maximum users should not be used when setting user fees and rates since it may be several years before all residents will need service by the system. In establishing rates a realistic number of users should be employed.

      (2)  The amount of cash contributions required will be set by the applicant and concurred in by the approval official. Contributions should be an amount high enough to indicate sincere interest on the part of the potential user, but not so high as to preclude service to low income families. Contributions ordinarily should be an amount approximating one year's minimum user fee, and shall be paid in full before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Once economic feasibility is ascertained based on a demonstration of potential user cash contributions, the contribution, membership fee or other fees that may be imposed are not a loan requirement under this section. A new user cash contribution is not required when:

      (i) The Agency determines that the potential users as a whole in the applicant's service area cannot make cash contributions; or

      (ii) State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority agrees in writing to enforce such statutes, or ordinances.

      (3) An enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause is required (RUS Bulletin 1780-9 can be used) except:

      (i) For users presently receiving service; or

      (ii) Where mandatory use of the system is required.

      (4) Individual vacant property owners will not be considered when determining project feasibility unless:

      (i) The owner has plans to develop the property in a reasonable period of time and become a user of the facility; and

      (ii) The owner agrees in writing to make a monthly payment at least equal to the proportionate share of debt service attributable to the vacant property until the property is developed and the facility is utilized on a regular basis. A bond or escrowed security deposit must be provided to guarantee this monthly payment and to guarantee an amount at least equal to the owner's proportionate share of construction costs. If a bond is provided, it must be executed by a surety company that appears on the Treasury Department's most current list (Circular 570, as amended) and be authorized to transact business in the State where the project is located. The guarantee shall be payable jointly to the borrower and the United States of America.

      (5) Applicants must provide a positive program to encourage connection by all users as soon as service is available. The program will be available for review and concurrence by the processing office before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Such a program shall include:

      (i) An aggressive information program to be carried out during the construction period. The applicant should send written notification to all signed users in advance of the date service will be available, stating the date users will be expected to have their connections completed, and the date user charges will begin;

      (ii) Positive steps to assure that installation services will be available. These may be provided by the contractor installing the system, local plumbing companies, or local contractors;

      (iii) Aggressive action to see that all signed users can finance their connections.

      (d)  For all loans exceeding $500,000, where funds can be borrowed at reasonable interest rates on an interim basis from commercial sources for the construction period, such interim financing may be obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of RUS loan funds. However, the approval official may make an exception when interim financing is cost prohibitive or unavailable. Guidance on informing the private lender of RUS's commitment is available from the Agency. When interim commercial financing is used, the application will be processed, including obtaining construction bids, to the stage where the RUS loan would normally be closed, that is immediately prior to the start of construction. The RUS loan should be closed as soon as possible after the disbursal of all interim funds.

      (e)  Provision for the accumulation of necessary reserves over a reasonable period of time will be included in the loan documents.

      (1)  Ordinarily, the requirements for reserves will be considered to have been met if general obligation or other bonds which pledge the full faith and credit of the political subdivision are used, or special assessment bonds are used, and if such bonds provide for the annual collection of sufficient taxes or assessments to cover debt service.

      (2)  Each borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves sufficient to assure that loan installments will be paid on time, for emergency maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for replacement of short-lived assets which have a useful life significantly less than the repayment period of the loan. Borrowers issuing bonds or other evidences of debt pledging facility revenues as security will plan their debt reserve to provide for at least one average annual loan installment. The debt reserve will accumulate at the rate of one-tenth of an average annual loan installment each year unless prohibited by state law.

      (f)  For organizations other than public bodies, the membership will authorize the project and its financing. Form RD 1942-8, “Resolution of Members or Stockholders,” may be used for this authorization. The approval official may accept RUS Bulletin 1780-28, “Loan Resolution Security Agreement,” without such membership authorization when State statutes and the organization's charter and bylaws do not require such authorization; and

      (1) The organization is well established and is operating with a sound financial base; or

      (2) The members of the organization have all signed an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause and have made the required meaningful user cash contribution.

      (g)  The purpose of RUS's insurance requirements is to protect the government's financial interest based on the facility financed with loan funds. It is the responsibility of the applicant and not that of RUS to assure that adequate insurance and fidelity or employee dishonesty bond coverage is maintained. The requirements below apply to all types of coverage determined necessary. The approval official may grant exceptions to normal requirements when appropriate justification is provided establishing that it is in the best interest of the applicant and will not adversely affect the government's interest.

      (1) Insurance requirements proposed by the applicant will be accepted if the processing office determines that proposed coverage is adequate to protect the government's financial interest. Applicants are encouraged to have their attorney, consulting engineer, and/or insurance provider(s) review proposed types and amounts of coverage, including any deductible provisions.

      (2) The use of deductibles may be allowed by RUS providing the applicant has financial resources which would likely be adequate to cover potential claims requiring payment of the deductible.

      (3)  Applicants will provide coverage for all persons who have access to funds, including persons working under a contract or management agreement. Coverage may be provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through “blanket” coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees. An exception may be granted by the approval official when funds relating to the facility financed are handled by another entity and it is determined that the entity has adequate coverage or the government's interest would otherwise be adequately protected. The amount of coverage required by RUS will normally approximate the total annual debt service requirements for the RUS loans.

      (4)  Fire and extended coverage will normally be maintained on all structures except as noted below. Ordinarily, RUS should be listed as mortgagee on the policy when RUS has a lien on the property. Normally, major items of equipment or machinery located in the insured structures must also be covered. Exceptions:

      (i) Reservoirs, pipelines and other structures if such structures are not normally insured;

      (ii) Subsurface lift stations except for the value of electrical and pumping equipment therein.

      (5) General liability insurance, including vehicular coverage.

      (6) Flood insurance required for facilities located in special flood-and mudslide-prone areas.

      (7)  The borrower will carry worker's compensation insurance for employees in accordance with State laws.

      (h) [Reserved]

      (i) The processing office will assure that appropriate forms and documents listed in RUS Bulletin 1780-6 are complete. Letters of conditions will not be issued unless funds are available.

      § 1780.42   Transfer of obligations.

#### § § 1780.42

      An obligation of funds established for an applicant may be transferred to a different (substituted) applicant provided:

      (a) The substituted applicant is eligible and has the authority to receive the assistance approved for the original applicant; and

      (b) The need, purpose(s) and scope of the project for which RUS funds will be used remain substantially unchanged.

      § 1780.43   [Reserved]

#### § § 1780.43

      § 1780.44   Actions prior to loan or grant closing or start of construction, whichever occurs first.

#### § § 1780.44

      (a) Applicants must provide evidence of adequate insurance and fidelity or employee dishonesty bond coverage.

      (b)  In connection with a project that involves new users and will be secured by a pledge of user fees or revenues, the processing office will authenticate the number of users. Ordinarily each signed user agreement will be reviewed and checked for evidence of cash contributions. If during the review any indication is received that all signed users may not connect to the system, there will be such additional investigation made as deemed necessary to determine the number of users who will connect to the system.

      (c)  An initial compliance review should be completed under subpart E of part 1901 of this title.

      (d)  An applicant contributing funds toward the project cost shall deposit these funds in its project account before start of construction. Project costs paid with applicant funds prior to the required deposit time shall be appropriately accounted for.

      (e)  If there is a significant reduction in project cost, the applicant's funding needs will be reassessed. Decreases in RUS funds will be based on revised project costs and current number of users, however, other factors including RUS regulations used at the time of loan or grant approval will remain the same. Obligated loan or grant funds not needed to complete the proposed project will be deobligated. Any reduction will be applied to grant funds first. In such cases, applicable forms, the letter of conditions, and other items will be revised.

      (f)  Applicants expecting funds from other sources for use in completing projects being partially financed with RUS funds will present evidence of the commitment of these funds from such other sources. An agreement should be reached with all funding sources on how funds are to be disbursed before the start of construction. RUS funds will not be used to pre-finance funds committed to the project from other sources.

      (g)  Applicants are responsible for acquisition of all property rights necessary for the project and will determine that prices paid are reasonable and fair. RUS may require an appraisal by an independent appraiser or Agency employee.

      (1)  Applicants will obtain valid, continuous and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility.

      (i) The applicant must provide a legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Form RD 442-22, “Opinion of Counsel Relative to Rights-of-Way,” may be used. When a site is for major structures such as a reservoir or pumping station and the applicant is able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, the applicant will furnish a title report thereon by the applicant's attorney showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any.

      (ii) For user connections funded by RUS, applicants will obtain adequate rights to construct and maintain the connection line or other facilities located on the user's property. This right may be obtained through formal easement or user agreements.

      (2)  Title to land essential to the successful operation of facilities or title to facilities being purchased, must not contain any restrictions that will adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility. Preliminary and final title opinions must be provided by the applicant's attorney. The opinions must be in sufficient detail to assess marketability of the property. Form RD 1927-9, “Preliminary Title Opinion,” and Form RD 1927-10, “Final Title Opinion,” may be used to provide the required title opinions.

      (i) In lieu of receiving title opinions from the applicant's attorney, the applicant may use a title insurance company. If a title insurance company is used, the applicant must provide the Agency a title insurance binder, disclosing all title defects or restrictions, and include a commitment to issue a title insurance policy. The policy should be in an amount at least equal to the market value of the property as improved. The title insurance binder and commitment should be provided to the Agency prior to requesting closing instructions. The Agency will be provided a title insurance policy which will insure RUS's interest in the property without any title defects or restrictions which have not been waived by the Agency.

      (ii) The approval official may waive title defects or restrictions, such as utility easements, that do not adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility.

      (3)  The following will be furnished as applicable:

      (i) A statement by the applicant's attorney regarding the nature of the water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant (such as conveyance of title, appropriation and decree, application and permit, public notice and appropriation and use).

      (ii) A copy of a contract with another company or municipality to supply water; or stock certificates in another company which represents the right to receive water.

      (4)  Where the right of use or control of real property not owned by the applicant is essential to the successful operation of the facility during the life of the loan, such right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the owner of the property and the applicant. Lease agreements shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site of facility, forfeiture or summary cancellation clauses. Lease agreements shall provide for the right to transfer, encumber, assign and sub-lease without restriction. Lease agreements will ordinarily be written for a term at least equal to the term of the loan. Such lease contracts or agreements will be approved by the approval official with the advice and counsel of OGC, as necessary.

      (h)  The information required by OGC will be transmitted to OGC with request for closing instructions. Upon receipt of closing instructions, the processing office will discuss with the applicant and its engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with closing. State program officials have the option to work with OGC to obtain waivers for closing instructions in certain cases. Closing instructions are not required for grants.

      § 1780.45   Loan and grant closing and delivery of funds.

#### § § 1780.45

      (a)  Notes and bonds will be completed on the date of loan closing except for the entry of subsequent RUS multiple advances where applicable. The amount of each note will be in multiples of not less than $100. The amount of each bond will ordinarily be in multiples of not less than $1,000.

      (1) Form RD 440-22, “Promissory Note (Association or Organization),” will ordinarily be used for loans to nonpublic bodies.

      (2) RUS Bulletins 1780-27, “Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),” or 1780-28, “Loan Resolution Security Agreement,” will be adopted by public and other-than-public bodies. These resolutions supplement other provisions in this part.

      (3) Subpart D of this part contains instructions for preparation of notes and bonds evidencing indebtedness of public bodies.

      (b)  (1) Multiple advances. Multiple advances will be used only for loans in excess of $100,000. Advances will be made only as needed to cover disbursements required by the borrower over a 30-day period.

      (i) Subpart D of this part contains instructions for making multiple advances to public bodies.

      (ii) Advances will be requested by the borrower in writing. The request should be in sufficient amounts to pay cost of construction, rights-of-way and land, legal, engineering, interest, and other expenses as needed. The borrower may use Form RD 440-11, “Estimate of Funds Needed for 30 Day Period Commencing XXX,” to show the amount of funds needed during the 30-day period.

      (2) RUS loan funds obligated for a specific purpose, such as the paying of interest, but not needed at the time of loan closing will remain in the Finance Office until needed unless State statutes require all funds to be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing. Loan funds may be advanced to prepay costs under § 1780.9 (e)(2)(iv). If all funds must be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing to comply with State statutes, funds not needed at loan closing will be handled as follows:

      (i) Deposited in an appropriate borrower account, such as debt service or construction accounts; or

      (ii) Deposited in a joint bank account under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

      (c)  RUS Bulletin 1780-12 “Water or Waste System Grant Agreement” of this part will be completed and executed in accordance with the requirements of grant approval. The grant will be considered closed when RUS Bulletin 1780-12 has been properly executed. Processing or approval officials are authorized to sign the grant agreement on behalf of RUS. For grants that supplement RUS loan funds, the grant should be closed simultaneously with the closing of the loan. However, when grant funds will be disbursed before loan closing, as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the grant will be closed not later than the delivery date of the first advance of grant funds.

      (d)  RUS policy is not to disburse grant funds from the Treasury until they are actually needed by the applicant. Applicant funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS grant funds. RUS loan funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS grant funds except when:

      (1) Interim financing of the total estimated amount of loan funds needed during construction is arranged; and

      (2) All interim funds have been disbursed; and

      (3) RUS grant funds are needed before the RUS loan can be closed.

      (e)  (1) Arrangements will be agreed upon for the prior concurrence by the Agency of the bills or vouchers upon which warrants will be drawn. Form RD 402-2, “Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,” or similar form will be used by the Agency to monitor funds. Periodic reviews of these accounts shall be made by the Agency.

      (2)  Grant funds must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage. Also, if the balance in the account containing grant funds exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage, the excess amount must be collaterally secured. The pledge of collateral for the excess will be in accordance with Treasury Circular 176.

      (3)  RUS funds and any funds furnished by the borrower including contributions to purchase major items of equipment, machinery, and furnishings will be deposited in a joint RUS/borrower bank account if determined necessary by the approval official. When RUS has a Memorandum of Understanding with another agency that provides for the use of joint RUS/borrower accounts, or when RUS is the primary source of funds for a project and has determined that the use of a joint RUS/borrower bank account is necessary, project funds from other sources may also be deposited in the joint bank account. RUS shall not be accountable to the source of the other funds nor shall RUS undertake responsibility to administer the funding program of the other entity. Joint RUS/borrower bank accounts should not be used for funds advanced by an interim lender. When funds exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage, the excess must have a pledge of collateral in accordance with Treasury Circular 176.

      (4)  Project costs will be monitored by the RUS processing office. Invoices will be approved by the borrower and their engineer, as appropriate, and submitted to the processing office for concurrence. The review and acceptance of project costs, including construction pay estimates, by RUS does not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown or that the work has been performed under the terms of the agreements or contracts.

      (f)  Funds remaining after all costs incident to the basic project have been paid or provided for will not include applicant contributions. Funds remaining, may be considered in direct proportion to the amounts obtained from each source. Remaining funds will be handled as follows:

      (1) Remaining funds may be used for eligible loan or grant purposes, provided the use will not result in major changes to the facility(s) and the purpose of the loan and grant remains the same;

      (2) RUS loan funds that are not needed will be applied as an extra payment on the RUS indebtedness unless other disposition is required by the bond ordinance, resolution, or State statute; and

      (3) Grant funds not expended under paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be canceled. Prior to the actual cancellation, the borrower, its attorney and its engineer will be notified of RUS's intent to cancel the remaining funds. The applicant will be given appropriate appeal rights.

      (g)  In order to determine that the loan has been properly closed the loan docket will be reviewed by OGC. The State program official has the option to consult with OGC to obtain waivers of this review.

#### § § 1780.46

      § 1780.47   Borrower accounting methods, management reporting and audits.

#### § § 1780.47

      (a) Borrowers are required to provide RUS an annual audit or financial statements.

      (b)  Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless State statutes or regulatory agencies provide otherwise, or an exception is granted by the Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a basis other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary adjustments so that annual financial statements are presented on the accrual basis.

      (c)  Each borrower shall retain all records, books, and supporting material for 3 years after the issuance of the audit or management reports. Upon request, this material will be made available to RUS, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Comptroller General, or to their assignees.

      (d)  All audits are to be performed in accordance with the latest revision of the generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. In addition, the audits are also to be performed in accordance with subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. The type of audit each borrower is required to submit will be designated by RUS. Further guidance on preparing an acceptable audit can be obtained from RUS. It is not intended that audits required by this part be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be done in conjunction with those audits. Audits must be performed annually except as allowed under the provisions for biennial audits provided in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200. Audits are to be submitted to the processing office as soon as possible after receipt of the auditor's report but no later than nine months after the end of the audit period

      (e)  All borrowers who are exempt from audits, will, within 60 days following the end of each fiscal year, furnish the RUS with annual financial statements, consisting of a verification of the organization's balance sheet and statement of income and expense by an appropriate official of the organization. Forms RD 442-2, “Statement of Budget, Income and Equity,” and 442-3 may be used.

      (f)  These reports will furnish management with a means of evaluating prior decisions and serve as a basis for planning future operations and financial strategies. In those cases where revenues from multiple sources are pledged as security for an RUS loan, two reports will be required; one for the project being financed by RUS and one combining the entire operation of the borrower. In those cases where RUS loans are secured by general obligation bonds or assessments and the borrower combines revenues from all sources, one management report combining all such revenues is acceptable. The following management data will be submitted by the borrower to the processing office. These reports at a minimum will include a balance sheet and income and expense statement.

      (1)  A quarterly management report will be required for the first year for new borrowers and for all borrowers experiencing financial or management problems for one year from the date problems were noted. If the borrower's account is current at the end of the year, the processing office may waive the required reports.

      (2)  Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year the following will be submitted to the processing office. (If Form RD 442-2 is used as the annual management report, enter data in column three only of Schedule 1, and complete all of Schedule 2.)

      (i) Two copies of the management reports and proposed “Annual Budget”.

      (ii) Financial information may be reported on Form RD 442-2 which includes Schedule 1, “Statement of Budget, Income and Equity” and Schedule 2, “Projected Cash Flow” or information in similar format.

      (iii) A copy of the rate schedule in effect at the time of submission.

      (g)  When RUS loans are secured by the general obligation of the public body or tax assessments which total 100 percent of the debt service requirements, the State program official may authorize an annual audit to substitute for other management reports if the audit is received within nine months after the end of the audit period.

      § 1780.48   Regional commission grants.

#### § § 1780.48

      Grants are sometimes made by regional commissions for projects eligible for RUS assistance. RUS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RUS assistance.

      (a) When RUS has funds in the project, no charge will be made for administering regional commission funds.

      (b) When RUS has no loan or grant funds in the project, an administrative charge will be made pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.C.S. 1535). A fee of 5 percent of the first $100,000 of a regional commission grant and 1 percent of any amount over $100,000 will be paid to RUS by the commission.

      (1)  RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be followed in determining the responsibilities of RUS. The ARC Federal Co-chairman and the State program official will provide each other with the necessary notification and certification.

      (2)  Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 ) authorizes other commissions similar to ARC. RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be used to develop a separate project management agreement between RUS and the commission for each project. The agreement should be prepared by the State program official as soon as notification is received that a commission grant will be made and the amount is confirmed.

      (c) Regional commission grants should be obligated as soon as possible in accordance with § 1780.41, except that the announcement procedure referred to in RUS Staff Instruction 1780-2 is not applicable. Regional commission grants will be disbursed from the Finance Office in the same manner as RUS funds.

      § 1780.53   General.

#### § § 1780.53

      This subpart is specifically designed for use by owners including the professional or technical consultants or agents who provide assistance and services such as engineering, environmental, inspection, financial, legal or other services related to planning, designing, bidding, contracting, and constructing water and waste disposal facilities. These procedures do not relieve the owner of the contractual obligations that arise from the procurement of these services. For this subpart, an owner is defined as an applicant, borrower, or grantee.

      § 1780.54   Technical services.

#### § § 1780.54

      Owners are responsible for providing the engineering, architect and environmental services necessary for planning, designing, bidding, contracting, inspecting, and constructing their facilities. Services may be provided by the owner's “in house” engineer or architect or through contract, subject to Agency concurrence. Engineers and architects must be licensed in the State where the facility is to be constructed.

      § 1780.55   Preliminary engineering reports and environmental review documentation.

#### § § 1780.55

      Preliminary engineering reports (PERs) must conform to customary professional standards. PER guidelines for water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and storm sewer are available from the Agency. Environmental review documentation must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.

#### § § 1780.56

      § 1780.57   Design policies.

#### § § 1780.57

      Facilities financed by the Agency will be designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices, and must meet the requirements of Federal, State and local agencies.

      (a)  Facilities financed by the Agency must undergo an environmental impact analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and RUS procedures. Facility planning and design must not only be responsive to the owner's needs but must consider the environmental consequences of the proposed project. Facility design shall incorporate and integrate, where practicable, mitigation measures that avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts. Environmental reviews serve as a means of assessing environmental impacts of project proposals, rather than justifying decisions already made. Applicants may not take any action on a project proposal that will have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable project alternatives being reviewed prior to the completion of the Agency's environmental review.

      (b)  All facilities intended for or accessible to the public or in which physically handicapped persons may be employed must be developed in compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 ) as implemented by 41 CFR 101-19.6, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C 1474 ) as implemented by 7 CFR parts 15 and 15b, and Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 ).

      (c)  Facility design should consider cost effective energy-efficient and environmentally-sound products and services.

      (d)  Water facilities should have sufficient capacity to provide reasonable fire protection to the extent practicable.

      (e)  Facilities should have sufficient capacity to provide for reasonable growth to the extent practicable.

      (f)  Owners are encouraged, when economically feasible, to incorporate water conservation practices into a facility's design. For existing water systems, evidence must be provided showing that the distribution system water losses do not exceed reasonable levels.

      (g)  No funds shall be made available under this part for a water system unless the Agency determines that the water system will make significant progress toward meeting the standards established under title XIV of the Public Health Service Act (commonly known as the ‘Safe Drinking Water Act’) (42 U.S.C. 300f ).

      (h)  No funds shall be made available under this part for a water treatment discharge or waste disposal system unless the Agency determines that the effluent from the system conforms with applicable Federal and State water pollution control standards.

      (i)  New combined sanitary and storm water sewer facilities will not be financed by the Agency. Extensions to existing combined systems can only be financed when separate systems are impractical.

      (j)  Projects involving any artificial barrier which impounds or diverts water, or the rehabilitation or improvement of such a barrier, must comply with the provisions for dam safety as set forth in the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety (Government Printing Office stock No. 041-001-00187-5, Superintendent of Documents, Attn: New Orders, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954) as prepared by the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.

      (k)  All pipe used shall meet current American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) or American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards.

      (l)  For new water systems or extensions to existing water systems, leakage shall not exceed limits set by either ASTM or AWWA whichever is the more stringent.

      (m)  Water facilities financed by the Agency will have metering devices for each connection. An exception to this requirement may be granted by the State program official when the owner demonstrates that installation of metering devices would be a significant economic detriment and that environmental considerations would not be adversely affected by not installing such devices. Sanitary sewer projects should incorporate water system metering devices whenever practicable.

      (n)  The facility's design must provide the most economical service practicable.

      (o)  All new structures, fully or partially enclosed, used or intended for sheltering persons or property will be designed with appropriate seismic safety provisions in compliance with the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7701 ), and Executive Order 12699, Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction (3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 269). Designs of components essential for system operation and substantial rehabilitation of structures that are used for sheltering persons or property should incorporate seismic safety provisions to the extent practicable. RUS implementing regulations for seismic safety are in 7 CFR part 1972, subpart C.

#### § § 1780.61

      Contract documents must be sufficiently descriptive and legally binding in order to accomplish the work as economically and expeditiously as possible.

      (a)  If the construction contract documents utilized are not in the format previously approved by the Agency, OGC's review of the construction contract documents will be obtained prior to their use.

      (b)  The owner's attorney will review the executed contract documents, including performance and payment bonds, and will certify that they are adequate, and that the persons executing these documents have been properly authorized to do so. The contract documents, engineer's recommendation for award, and bid tabulation sheets will be forwarded to the Agency for concurrence prior to awarding the contract. All contracts will contain a provision that they are not effective until they have been concurred in by the Agency. The State program official or designee is responsible for concurring in construction contracts with the legal advice and guidance of the OGC when necessary.

      § 1780.62   Utility purchase contracts.

#### § § 1780.62

      Applicants proposing to purchase water or other utility service from private or public sources shall have written contracts for supply or service which are reviewed and concurred in by the Agency. To the extent practical, the Agency review and concurrence of such contracts should take place prior to their execution by the owner. OGC advice and guidance may be requested. Form RD 442-30, “Water Purchase Contract,” may be used when appropriate. If the Agency loan will be repaid from system revenues, the contract will be pledged to the Agency as part of the security for the loan. Such contracts will:

      (a) Include a commitment by the supplier to furnish, at a specified point, an adequate quantity of water or other service and provide that, in case of shortages, all of the supplier's users will proportionately share shortages.

      (b) Set out the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the respective parties including the master meter if a meter is installed at the point of delivery.

      (c) Specify the initial rates and provide a type of escalator clause which will permit rates for the association to be raised or lowered proportionately as certain specified rates for the supplier's regular customers are raised or lowered. Provisions may be made for altering rates in accordance with the decisions of the appropriate State agency which may have regulatory authority.

      (d) Cover period of time which is at least equal to the repayment period of the loan. State program officials may approve contracts for shorter periods of time if the supplier cannot legally contract for such period, or if the owner and supplier find it impossible or impractical to negotiate a contract for the maximum period permissible under State law, provided:

      (1) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or

      (2) The contract contains adequate provisions for renewal; or

      (3) A determination is made that in the event the contract is terminated, there are or will be other adequate sources available to the owner that can feasibly be developed or purchased.

      (e) Set out in detail the amount of connection or demand charges, if any, to be made by the supplier as a condition to making the service available to the owner. However, the payment of such charges from loan funds shall not be approved unless the Agency determines that it is more feasible and economical for the owner to pay such a connection charge than it is for the owner to provide the necessary supply by other means.

      (f) Provide for a pledge of the contract to the Agency as part of the security for the loan.

      (g) Not contain provisions for:

      (1) Construction of facilities which will be owned by the supplier. This does not preclude the use of money paid as a connection charge for construction to be done by the supplier.

      (2) Options for the future sale or transfer. This does not preclude an agreement recognizing that the supplier and owner may at some future date agree to a sale of all or a portion of the facility.

      (h) If it is impossible to obtain a firm commitment for either an adequate quantity or sharing shortages proportionately, a contract may be executed and concurred in provided adequate evidence is furnished to enable the Agency to make a determination that the supplier has adequate supply and/or treatment facilities to furnish its other users and the applicant for the foreseeable future; and:

      (1) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or

      (2) A suitable alternative supply could be arranged within the repayment ability of the borrower if it should become necessary; or

      (3) Concurrence in the proposed contract is obtained from the National Office.

#### § § 1780.69

      § 1780.70   Owner's procurement regulations.

#### § § 1780.70

      Owner's procurement requirements must comply with the following standards:

      (a)  Owners shall maintain a written code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of their officers, employees or agents engaged in the award and administration of contracts supported by Agency funds. No employee, officer or agent of the owner shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Agency funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Examples of such conflicts would arise when: the employee, officer or agent; any member of their immediate family; their partner; or an organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above; has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for the award.

      (1) The owner's officers, employees or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements.

      (2) To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, the owner's standards of conduct shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the owner's officers, employees, agents, or by contractors or their agents.

      (b)  All procurement transactions, regardless of whether by sealed bids or by negotiation and without regard to dollar value, shall be conducted in a manner that provides maximum open and free competition. Procurement procedures shall not restrict or eliminate competition. Examples of what are considered to be restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; noncompetitive practices between firms; organizational conflicts of interest; and unnecessary experience and bonding requirements. In specifying materials, the owner and its consultant will consider all materials normally suitable for the project commensurate with sound engineering practices and project requirements. The Agency shall consider fully any recommendation made by the owner concerning the technical design and choice of materials to be used for a facility. If the Agency determines that a design or material, other than those that were recommended should be considered by including them in the procurement process as an acceptable design or material in the water or waste disposal facility, the Agency shall provide such owner with a comprehensive justification for such a determination. The justification will be documented in writing.

      (c)  Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by the owner's officials to avoid the purchase of unnecessary or duplicate items. Consideration should be given to consolidation or separation of procurement items to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine which approach would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and efficiency, owners are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.

      (d) Solicitation of offers, whether by competitive sealed bid or competitive negotiation, shall:

      (1) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific feature of the name brands which must be met by the offeror shall be clearly stated; and

      (2) Clearly specify all requirements which offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

      (e) Affirmative steps should be taken to assure that small, minority, and women businesses are utilized when possible as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services.

      (f)  Cost plus a percentage of cost method of contracting shall not be used.

      (g)  The following will not be allowed to bid on, or negotiate for, a contract or subcontract related to the construction of the project:

      (1) An engineer as an individual or firm who has prepared plans and specifications or who will be responsible for monitoring the construction;

      (2) Any firm or corporation in which the owner's engineer is an officer, employee, or holds or controls a substantial interest;

      (3) The governing body's officers, employees, or agents;

      (4) Any member of the immediate family or partners in the entities referred to in paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section; or

      (5) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any person in the entities referred to in paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3) or (g)(4) of this section.

      (h)  Contracts shall be made only with responsible parties possessing the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall include but not be limited to matters such as integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, and accessibility to other necessary resources. Contracts shall not be made with parties who are suspended or debarred by any Agency of the United States Government.

      § 1780.74   Contracts awarded prior to applications.

#### § § 1780.74

      Owners awarding construction or other procurement contracts prior to filing an application, must provide evidence that is satisfactory to the Agency that the contract was entered into without intent to circumvent the requirements of Agency regulations.

      (a)  The contract shall be modified to conform with the provisions of this part. Where this is not possible, modifications will be made to the extent practicable and, as a minimum, the contract must comply with all State and local laws and regulations as well as statutory requirements and executive orders related to the Agency financing. When all construction is complete and it is impracticable to modify the contracts, the owner must provide the certification required by paragraph (c) of this section.

      (b)  Provide a certification by an engineer, licensed in the State where the facility is constructed, that any construction performed complies fully with the plans and specifications.

      (c)  Provide a certification by the owner that the contractor has complied with applicable statutory and executive requirements related to Agency financing for construction already performed.

      § 1780.75   Contract provisions.

#### § § 1780.75

      In addition to provisions required for a valid and legally binding contract, any recipient of Agency funds shall include the following contract provisions in all contracts.

      (a)  Contracts for more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold shall contain provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. A realistic liquidated damage provision should be included in all contracts for construction.

      (b)  All contracts exceeding $10,000, shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the owner including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

      (c)  In all contracts for construction or facility improvements exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the owner shall require bonds or cash deposit in escrow assuring performance and payment each in the amount of 100 percent of the contract cost. The surety will be in the form of performance bonds and payment bonds. For contracts of lesser amounts, the owner may require surety. When a surety is not provided, contractors will furnish evidence of payment in full for all materials, labor, and any other items procured under the contract. Form RD 1924-10, “Release by Claimants,” and Form RD 1924-9, “Certificate of Contractor's Release,” may be used for this purpose. Companies providing performance bonds and payment bonds must hold a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds as listed in Treasury Circular 570 as amended and the surety must be listed as having a license to do business in the State where the facility is located.

      (d)  All contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by owners shall contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1966 Comp., p.339), entitled, “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375 (3 CFR, 1968 Comp., p. 321), and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations 41 CFR chapter 60.

      (e)  All contracts for construction shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874). This Act provides that each contractor shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which they are otherwise entitled. The owner shall report suspected or reported violations to the Agency.

      (f)-(g) [Reserved]

      (h)  The construction contract shall require that all contract change orders be concurred in by the Agency.

      (i)  All contracts must contain a provision that they shall not be effective unless and until the State program official or designee concurs in writing.

      (j)  All construction contracts shall contain adequate provisions for retainage. No payments will be made that would deplete the retainage nor place in escrow any funds that are required for retainage nor invest the retainage for the benefit of the contractor. The retainage shall not be less than an amount equal to 5 percent of an approved partial payment estimate until the project is substantially complete and accepted by the owner, consulting engineer and Agency. The contract must provide that additional amounts may be retained if the job is not proceeding satisfactorily.

      (k)  Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that requires the contractor to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

      (l)  Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market.

      (m)  A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the governmentwide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 417, “Debarment and Suspension.” SAM exclusion records contain the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549.

      (n)  Contractors that apply or bid for an award exceeding $100,000 must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award.

      (o)  A public body, such as a state government, state agency, municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a state, territory or commonwealth, must ensure its contracts include provisions requiring compliance with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The requirements of Section 6002 include procuring only items designated in guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines.

#### § § 1780.76

      Owners shall be responsible for maintaining a contract administration system to monitor the contractors' performance and compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contracts.

      (a)  Prior to beginning construction, the owner will schedule a preconstruction conference where the consulting engineer will review the planned development with the Agency, owner, resident inspector, attorney, contractor, and other interested parties. The conference will thoroughly cover applicable items included in Form RD 1924-16, “Record of Pre-construction Conference,” and the discussions and agreements will be documented.

      (b)  The owner is required to monitor construction and provide a report to the Agency giving a full explanation under the following circumstances:

      (1) Reasons why approved construction schedules were not met;

      (2) Analysis and explanation of cost overruns and how payment is to be made for the same; and

      (3) If events occur which have a significant impact upon the project.

      (c)  Full-time resident inspection is required for all construction unless a written exception is made by the Agency upon written request of the owner. Unless otherwise agreed, the resident inspector will be provided by the consulting engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the consulting engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the resident inspector to the owner and to the Agency for acceptance in writing. If the owner provides the resident inspector, it must submit a resume of the inspector's qualifications to the project engineer for comments and the Agency for acceptance in writing prior to the preconstruction conference. The resident inspector will work under the technical supervision of the project engineer and the role and responsibilities will be defined in writing.

      (d)  The resident inspector will maintain a record of the daily construction progress in the form of a daily diary and daily inspection reports. The daily entries shall be made available to the Agency personnel and will be reviewed during project inspections. The original complete set will be furnished to the owner upon completion of construction. RUS Bulletin 1780-18 is available from the Agency for preparing daily inspection reports or the reports can be provided in other formats approved by the State staff engineer.

      (e)  Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” or other similar form may be used for construction payments. If Form 1924-18 is not used, prior concurrence by the State staff engineer must be obtained.

      (1) Payment of contract retainage will not be made until such retainage is due and payable under the terms of the contact.

      (2) Invoices for the payment of construction costs must be approved by the owner, project engineer and concurred in by the Agency.

      (3) The review and acceptance of project costs, including construction payment estimates by the Agency shall not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown, or that the work has been performed under the terms of agreements or contracts.

      (f)  A prefinal inspection will be made by the owner, resident inspector, project engineer, contractor, representatives of other agencies involved, and Agency representative (preferably the State staff engineer or designee). The inspection results will be recorded by the project engineer and a copy provided to all interested parties.

      (g)  A final inspection will be made by the Agency before final payment is made.

      (h)  (1) Changes in development plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Agency provided:

      (i) Funds are available to cover any additional costs; and

      (ii) The change is for an authorized loan or grant purpose; and

      (iii) It will not adversely affect the soundness of the facility operation or the Agency's security; and

      (iv) The change is within the scope of the contract,

      (2) Changes will be recorded on Form RD 1924-7, “Contract Change Order,” or other similar form if approved by the State program official or designee. Regardless of the form, change orders must be approved by the State program official or designee.

      (3) Changes should be accomplished only after Agency approval and shall be authorized only by means of contract change order. The change order will include items such as:

      (i) Any changes in labor and material;

      (ii) Changes in facility design;

      (iii) Any decrease or increase in quantities based on final measurements that are different from those shown in the bidding schedule; and

      (iv) Any increase or decrease in the time to complete the project.

      (4) All changes shall be recorded on chronologically numbered contract change orders as they occur. Change orders will not be included in payment estimates until approved by all parties.

      (k) For loans involving multiple advances of Agency loan funds, a preliminary approving opinion of bond counsel (or local counsel if no bond counsel is involved) if a final unqualified opinion cannot be obtained until all funds are advanced. The preliminary opinion for the entire issue shall be delivered at or before the time of the first advance of funds. It will state that the applicant has the legal authority to issue the bonds, construct, operate and maintain the facility, and repay the loan, subject only to changes occurring during the advance of funds, such as litigation resulting from the failure to advance loan funds, and receipt of closing certificates;

      (l) Final unqualified approving opinion of bond counsel, (and preliminary approving opinion, if required) or local counsel if no bond counsel is involved, including an opinion as to whether interest on bonds will be exempt from Federal and State income taxes. With approval of the State program official, a final opinion may be qualified to the extent that litigation is pending relating to Indian claims that may affect title to land or validity of the obligation. It is permissible for such opinion to contain language referring to the last sentence of section 306 (a)(1) or to section 309A (h) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926 (a)(1) or 1929a (h)).

#### § §§ 1780.84-1780.86

      § 1780.87   Permanent instruments for Agency loans.

#### § § 1780.87

      Agency loans will be evidenced by an instrument determined legally sufficient and in accordance with the following order of preference:

      (a)  Refer to paragraph (b) of this section for methods of various frequency payment calculations.

      (b)  A single instrument providing for amortized installments which follows Form RD 440-22 as closely as possible. The full amount of the loan must show on the face of the instrument, and there must be provisions for entering the date and amount of each advance on the reverse or an attachment. When principal payments are deferred, the instrument will show that “interest only” is due on interest-only installment dates, rather than specific dollar amounts. The payment period including the “interest only” installment cannot exceed 40 years, the useful life of the facility, or State statute limitations, whichever occurs first. The amortized installment, computed as follows, will be shown as due on installment dates thereafter.

      (1)  Multiply by twelve the number of years between the due date of the last interest-only installment and the final installment to determine the number of monthly payments. When there are no interest-only installments, multiply by twelve the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the amortization factor and round to the next higher dollar.

      (2)  Multiply by two the number of years between the due date of the last interest-only installment and the due date of the final installment to determine the correct number of semiannual periods. When there are no interest-only installments, multiply by two the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the applicable amortization factor.

      (3)  Subtract the due date of the last interest-only installment from the due date of the final installment to determine the number of annual payments. When there are no interest-only installments, the number of annual payments will equal the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the applicable amortization factor and round to the next higher dollar.

      (c)  If a single instrument with amortized installments is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for installments of principal plus interest accrued on the principal balance. For bonds with semiannual interest and annual principal, the interest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance times the interest rate and dividing this figure by two. Principal installments are to be scheduled so that total combined interest and principal payments closely approximate amortized payments.

      (1) The repayment terms concerning interest only installments described in paragraph (b) of this section apply.

      (2) The instrument shall contain in substance provisions indicating:

      (i) Principal maturities and due dates;

      (ii) Regular payments shall be applied first to interest due through the next principal and interest installment due date and then to principal due in chronological order stipulated in the bond; and

      (iii) Payments on delinquent accounts will be applied in the following sequence:

      (A) Billed delinquent interest;

      (B) Past due interest installments;

      (C) Past due principal installments;

      (D) Interest installment due; and

      (E) Principal installment due.

      (d)  If instruments described under the first, second, and third preferences are not legally permissible, use serial bonds with a bond or bonds delivered in the amount of each advance. Bonds will be numbered consecutively and delivered in chronological order. Such bonds will conform to the minimum requirements of § 1780.94. Provisions for application of payments will be the same as those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (e)  Coupon bonds will not be used unless required by State statute. Such bonds will conform to the minimum requirements of § 1780.94.

#### § § 1780.90

      When none of the instruments described in § 1780.87 are legally permissible or practical, a bond anticipation note or similar temporary debt instrument may be used. The debt instrument will provide for multiple advances of Agency funds and will be for the full amount of the Agency loan. The instrument will be prepared by bond counsel, or local counsel if bond counsel is not involved, and approved by the State program official and OGC. At the same time the Agency delivers the last advance, the borrower will deliver the permanent bond instrument and the canceled temporary instrument will be returned to the borrower. The approved debt instrument will show at least the following:

      (a) The date from which each advance will bear interest;

      (b) The interest rate as determined by § 1780.13;

      (c) A payment schedule providing for interest on outstanding principal at least annually; and

      (d) A maturity date which shall be no earlier than the anticipated issuance date of the permanent instruments and no longer than the 40-year statutory limit.

      § 1780.94   Minimum bond specifications.

#### § § 1780.94

      The provisions of this section are minimum specifications only and must be followed to the extent legally permissible.

      (a)  Bond resolutions or ordinances will provide that the instruments be either a bond representing the total amount of the indebtedness or serial bonds in denominations customarily accepted in municipal financing (ordinarily in multiples of not less than $1,000). Single bonds may provide for repayment of principal plus interest or amortized installments. Amortized installments are preferred by the Agency.

      (b)  Bonds will contain provisions permitting registration for both principal and interest. Bonds purchased by the Agency will be registered in the name of “United States of America” and will remain so registered at all times while the bonds are held or insured by the Government. The Agency address for registration purposes will be that of the Finance Office.

      (c)  Size of bonds and coupons should conform to standard practice. Paper must be of sufficient quality to prevent deterioration through ordinary handling over the life of the loan.

      (d)  Bonds will normally be dated as of the day of delivery. However, the borrower may use another date if approved by the Agency. Loan closing is the date of delivery of the bonds or the date of delivery of the first bond when utilizing serial bonds, regardless of the date of delivery of the funds. The date of delivery will be stated in the bond if different from the date of the bond. In all cases, interest will accrue from the date of delivery of the funds.

      (e)  Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law.

      (1) If income is available monthly, monthly payments are recommended unless precluded by State law. If income is available quarterly or otherwise more frequently than annually, payments must be scheduled on such basis. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest (P&I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used.

      (2) The payment schedule will be enumerated in the evidence of debt, or if that is not feasible, in a supplemental agreement.

      (3) If feasible, the first payment will be scheduled one full month, or other period, as appropriate, from the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th, and 31st day of the month will be avoided. When principal payments are deferred, interest-only payments will be scheduled at least annually.

      (f)  Extra payments are derived from the sale of basic chattel or real estate security, refund of unused loan funds, cash proceeds of property insurance and similar actions which reduce the value of basic security. At the option of the borrower, regular facility revenue may also be used as extra payments when regular payments are current. Unless otherwise established in the note or bond, extra payments will be applied as follows:

      (1) For loans with amortized debt instruments, extra payments will be applied first to interest accrued to the date of receipt of the payment and second to principal.

      (2) For loans with debt instruments with P&I installments, the extra payment will be applied to the final unpaid principal installment.

      (3) For borrowers with more than one loan, the extra payment will be applied to the account secured by the lowest priority of lien on the property from which the extra payments was obtained. Any balance will be applied to other Agency loans secured by the property from which the extra payment was obtained.

      (4) For assessment bonds, see paragraph (k) of this section.

      (g) The place of payments on bonds purchased by the Agency will be determined by the Agency.

      (h)  Bonds will normally contain customary redemption provisions. However, no premium will be charged for early redemption on any bonds held by the Government.

      (i)  Parity bonds may be issued to complete the project. Otherwise, parity bonds may not be issued unless acceptable documentation is provided establishing that net revenues for the fiscal year following the year in which such bonds are to be issued will be at least 120 percent of the average annual debt serviced requirements on all bonds outstanding, including the newly-issued bonds. For purposes of this section, net revenues are, unless otherwise defined by State statute, gross revenues less essential operation and maintenance expenses. This limitation may be waived or modified by the written consent of bondholders representing 75 percent of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness. Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued in accordance with the loan resolution.

      (j)  The following types of provisions in debt instruments should be avoided:

      (1) Provisions for the holder to manually post each payment to the instrument.

      (2) Provisions for returning the permanent or temporary debt instrument to the borrower in order that it, rather than the Agency, may post the date and amount of each advance or repayment on the instrument.

      (3) Provisions that amend covenants contained in RUS Bulletins 1780-27 or 1780-28.

      (4) Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the contractual provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing requirement and any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect precludes the Agency from requiring refinancing before the final maturity date, it represents a violation of the statutory refinancing requirement; therefore, it is disallowed. No loan documents shall include a provision of defeasance.

      (k)  When security includes special assessment to be collected over the life of the loan, the instrument should address the method of applying any payments made before they are due. It may be desirable for such payments to be distributed over remaining payments due, rather than to be applied in accordance with normal procedures governing extra payments, so that the account does not become delinquent.

      (l)  The following will be adhered to when preparing debt instruments:

      (1) When more than one loan type is used in financing a project, each type of loan will be evidenced by a separate debt instrument or series of debt instruments;

      (2) Loans obligated in different fiscal years and those obligated with different terms in the same fiscal year will be evidenced by separate debt instruments;

      (3) Loans obligated for the same loan type in the same fiscal year with the same term may be combined in the same debt instrument;

      (4) Loans obligated in the same fiscal year with different interest rates that will be closed at the same interest rate may be combined in the same debt instrument.

      § 1780.95   Public bidding on bonds.

#### § § 1780.95

      Bonds offered for public sale shall be offered in accordance with State law and in such a manner to encourage public bidding. The Agency will not submit a bid at the advertised sale unless required by State law, nor will reference to Agency's rates and terms be included. If no acceptable bid is received, the Agency will negotiate the purchase of the bonds.

    (3) Nonprofit corporations will not be formed to serve an area which could be served by a public agency which has adequate authority to provide the needed service unless prior approval of the National Office is obtained.

    § 1781.6   Loan purposes.

#### § § 1781.6

    (a)  WS and RCD loans may be used for:

    (1) Water development, storage, treatment and conveyance to farms for irrigation and other farm use, including farmstead, livestock, orchard, and crop spraying.

    (2) Drainage systems and facilities in farm areas to sustain agricultural production or protect farmers and rural residents from water damage.

    (3) Agricultural water management practices for annual streamflow stabilization, recharging ground water reservoirs, and conserving water supplies by management and control of vegetation along waterways and in drainage basins.

    (4) Soil conservation and water control facilities such as dikes, terraces, detention reservoirs, stream channels, ditches, and other special land treatment and stabilization measures needed to protect farms and rural residents from water damage, provided such facilities cannot be installed or improved under, or will not conflict with, other public programs such as those administered by the Corps of Engineers.

    (5) Special treatment measures or equipment primarily, though not exclusively, for flood prevention such as:

    (i) Facilities and equipment for fire prevention and control.

    (ii) Tree planting and establishment of other vegetative cover for stabilizing critical runoff and sediment-producing areas.

    (iii) Structural and vegetative measures to stabilize stream channels and gullies.

    (iv) Basic farm conservation practices to control runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.

    (6) Installing, repairing, and improving water storage facilities, including outlets for immediate and future domestic, municipal and industrial water supply and water quality management, and conveying water to treatment facilities or distribution systems. When payment of loans for such facilities are primarily dependent upon revenues from use of water stored the loan approval official must determine the adequacy of facility for use of the water before a loan is closed.

    (7) Public water based recreation and fish and wildlife developer loans will only be made to public bodies for the local share of cost for such developments for which NRCS is providing technical or financial assistance from WS or RCD funds. Loans will not be made for developments larger or more elaborate than that which is included in the WS or RCD plan. Loans may include funds for:

    (i) Construction of necessary water resource improvements such as storage capacity in multipurpose and single purpose reservoirs, water level control structures in reservoirs and streams, and stream channel improvements necessary for the development of the facilities. This may include practices for improvement of fish and wildlife habitat and environment and related areas and facilities for proper protection and management of the development.

    (ii) Essential developments, improvements, equipment and facilities for access, public health and safety, and efficient operation management and maintenance; such as energy utilities, water supply and waste disposal systems, maintenance buildings, fences, cattle guards, roads and trails, parking, picnicking, camping, beaches, playgrounds, and related shelters and equipment.

    (iii) Special areas and structures such as forest and other vegetative cover, marshes, pits, shelters and fish ladders to provide protected natural spawning, breeding, nesting, and feeding for fish and wildlife.

    (8)  Measures to reduce agriculture-related pollutants that adversely affect the community and the general public. Measures may include, but are not limited to, holding ponds, debris basins, diversions, terraces, and community distribution systems.

    (9) Acquiring fee simple title to lands or perpetual easements, or rights-of-way for sites for works of improvement or project measures and related costs for removal, relocation, or replacement of existing improvements including relocation payments for displaced persons, business enterprises and facilities, and other related purposes. Funds for land acquisition will be limited to costs necessary for WS works of improvement or RCD measures. Final construction plans will indicate minimum essential lands and rights-of-way to be acquired. In some cases, sponsoring local organizations may need to acquire lands in excess of actual needs when it is expedient for planned development. If the Rural Development State Director determines that the acquisition of excess land is necessary or expedient for the orderly development of a WS works of improvement, or RCD measure, he may authorize the action subject to the following conditions:

    (i) The applicant must agree to sell excess land as soon as practicable and apply the proceeds, together with any income from excess land, on the debt to RUS.

    (ii) The applicant must furnish legal evidence of authority to acquire additional land and dispose of it as agreed.

    (iii) Evidence must be provided to justify acquisition of additional land.

    (iv) Easements for land or water resource protection structures must be perpetual and must not include clauses that terminate the easement with the dissolution or abandonment of the applicant organization. Loan funds will not be used for an easement that deviates in any way from that provided in the standard NRCS form unless modifications of it are approved by both NRCS and RUS.

    (10) Acquisition of water supply or water right by purchase or by appropriation under local, State, and Federal laws. The loan may include funds for the purchase of land on which the water supply or water right is presently being used when:

    (i) The water supply or water right cannot be purchased without the land; and

    (ii) The value of the land is not the major portion of the cost; and

    (iii) Any excess land thus acquired will be sold as soon as possible and the proceeds applied on the loan.

    (11) Purchase of equipment and machinery necessary for development and operation of planned WS works of improvement or RCD measures or projects including:

    (i)  Purchase or rent special-purpose equipment to install or maintain any community facility in categories in paragraph (a)(11) of this section or to establish on farms soil and water conservation measures such as terraces, ponds, land leveling for irrigation or drainage, subsoiling, seeding, tree planting, and removal of brush, scattered trees, and stumps, provided:

    (A) Such equipment is not otherwise available when needed.

    (B) There is sufficient need and local demand to justify ownership or rental.

    (C) Rates to be charged include, among other things, an allowance for depreciation, obsolescence, and replacement based upon the recommendations of the equipment manufacturer or the experience of contractors engaged in providing services for similar types of work.

    (ii)  Purchase or rent basic special-purpose equipment, facilities, certain land or land rights, and supplies needed for furnishing services for the establishment, improvement, protection, and harvesting of timber (not processing) suitable for lumber, pulp, poles or posts; providing that the forest program and forest practices benefiting from such services are in accordance with approved conservation practices for the development, use, and control of water resources on farms and in forests. Special-purpose equipment may include such items as tractors, bull dozers, plows, planters, trucks, loaders, fire-fighting equipment, and sprayers. Facilities may include such items as ponds and reservoirs, pipelines, buildings for storage of equipment and supplies, nurseries, access roads, fire lanes, and lookout towers. Supplies may include such things as seed, seedlings, fertilizers, fencing, and pesticides. Land or land-rights acquisition will be limited to that necessary for sites for facilities listed above which are directly related to the forestry program. Loans for these purposes may be made only when the equipment, supplies, and facilities to be provided:

    (A) Are not readily available when needed.

    (B) Will be justified by local need and demand.

    (C) Will be available to users at rates sufficient to cover loan amortization, obsolescence, replacement, operation, and cost of supplies.

    (D) Will more efficiently serve the group through cooperative effort.

    (12) Refinancing debt obligations of the sponsoring local organization that were incurred before application for a WS or RCD loan when that is not the primary purpose of the loan and:

    (i) The debt being refinanced was for works of improvement or measures for which loan funds could be used; and

    (ii) The debt is a valid obligation of the sponsor; and

    (iii) Creditors will not modify payment terms on existing debts, and the organization cannot pay existing debts and a loan from RUS over the same period of time; and

    (iv) Long-term debts will not be refinanced unless necessary to provide a sound basis for the loan or WS advance and concurrence is obtained from the National Office.

    (13) If repayment is based on revenues, loan funds (not WS advances) can be used for payment of interest installments until the facility is generating enough revenue to make accrued interest payments. Loan funds for interest payments will not exceed the estimated amount that will accrue to the end of the third full calendar year after loan closing without prior approval from the National Office.

    (14) Relocation payment to displaced persons, businesses, and farm operations and for relocation assistance advisory services in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-646, 84 Stat. 1894), the Regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Act (7 CFR part 21), and the Memorandum of Understanding Between NRCS and RUS.

    (iii) Costs of labor, technical or professional services, and fees to be incurred in obtaining the loan and in planning and completing the facilities or services to be financed with loan funds.

    (iv) Services such as those listed in paragraph (a)(16) of this section.

    (b)  Purposes for which RCD loans may be made in addition to those included in paragraph (a) of this section are:

    (1)  Lands, equipment and facilities to collect, transport, and dispose of solid waste in sanitary landfills for which NRCS is providing technical assistance.

    (2)  Lands for uses such as grazing, forestry, wildlife, natural areas and parks, greenbelts, and other open spaces.

    (3)  Purchase existing facilities for shift-in-land use, soil and water development, conservation, control and use when it is determined that purchase is necessary to provide efficient service through a facility owned and operated by a public agency (or a nonprofit corporation in a rural area), or the owner is either unwilling or unable to make improvements, enlargement, or extensions needed to provide significant additional or improved service for present users or for a new group of users at reasonable rates.

    (c)  NRCS watershed advances are loans that may be made from NRCS construction funds for the following purposes included in a watershed work plan agreement:

    (1) To pay construction costs including cost of engineering and related services for increasing reservoir capacity (including intake and outlet structures) for a future water supply for municipal, domestic, industrial, or agricultural uses.

    (2) To preserve sites for authorized watershed works of improvement by acquiring land, easements, and rights-of-ways or other property rights.

    § 1781.7   Loan and advance limitations and obligations incurred before loan closing.

#### § § 1781.7

    (a)  (1) Loans will not be used for:

    (xiv) Payment of that part of the cost of facilities, improvements, and practices that could be earned by participation in agricultural conservation programs unless such cost cannot be covered by purchase orders or assignments to material suppliers or contractors. If a loan is made for such purposes for which practice or cost share payments exceed $500, RUS will obtain an assignment on such payments to be paid on the loan.

    (xv) Primarily for water and sewage treatment plants and distribution systems.

    (xvi) Drainage facilities primarily for the benefit of other than rural areas.

    (xvii) Any single RCD measure that requires a loan of more than $500,000.

    (xviii) The total amount of principal outstanding for all WS loans made for one or more watershed works of improvement in a single watershed project, whether made to one or more sponsoring organizations, will not exceed $10,000,000.

    (b)  (1) A WS advance for future water supply will not be used for acquiring property rights including lands, easements, and rights-of-way; water rights; administration of contracts; storage capacity for immediate municipal use; pipelines from the reservoir to place of use; or for other uses such as irrigation, fish and wildlife, and recreation.

    (2) A WS advance for increasing reservoir capacity for future water supply will not exceed 30 percent of the total installation cost of one structure.

    (3) A WS advance for site preservation will not exceed that determined necessary by NRCS except to purchase land in excess of actual needs in accordance with the provisions of § 1781.6(a)(7).

    (4) Before a project agreement is entered into, there must be satisfactory evidence that the borrower will develop the site to be acquired or will use the future water supply and that revenue will be sufficient to meet all scheduled installments.

    (c)  (1) WS loans, WS advances, and RCD loans may be used for payment of obligations incurred before loan closing when the Rural Development State Director determines that:

    (i) The obligations incurred are necessary for planned developments; and

    (ii) The obligations are incurred for authorized loan purposes; and

    (iii) Contracts and construction plans meet RUS and NRCS standards; and

    (iv) The applicant has legal authority to incur the obligations at the time proposed; and

    (v) The Rural Development State Director authorizes such action in a letter to the applicant.

    (2) The Rural Development State Director's letter will specifically state that the permission is granted on the condition that RUS is not committed to make a loan and assumes no responsibility for any obligation incurred by the applicant because of the permission granted and that the loan will be closed subject to compliance with agency regulations including closing instructions of the Regional Attorney Office of the General Counsel.

    § 1781.8   Rates and terms—WS loans and WS advances and RCD loans.

#### § § 1781.8

    (a)  The interest rate for WS loans, WS advances and RCD loans will be at a rate not to exceed the current market yield for outstanding municipal obligations with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturity for the loan, adjusted to the nearest   of 1 percent.

    (1) For loans, unless otherwise required by State law, interest will accrue from date of check delivery where Form RD 440-22, “Promissory Note (Association Organization),” is used. Where bonds are used interest will accrue from the applicable dates recorded on the bonds. Where multiple loan disbursements are used interest will accrue from date of check.

    (2) Interest on an advance for future water supply will begin as required by State law, when water is first used from the future water storage capacity installed with advance, or ten years from the scheduled date of the completion of the facility, whichever date is the earlier.

    (3) Interest on an advance for preservation of sites will begin on the date the advance is closed.

    (b)  The repayment period on loans may not exceed the shortest of the following periods:

    (1) The statutory limitation on the sponsoring local organization's borrowing authority.

    (2) Fifty (50) years for WS loans and WS advances and 30 years for RCD loans from the date when the principal benefits from the WS works of improvement or RCD measure being financed first become available.

    (3) The useful life of the WS works of improvement or RCD measure being financed with loan or advance funds.

    (c)  Deferred or partial payments may be authorized in the following circumstances:

    (1) Payments need to be delayed until the receipt of income from taxes or other revenues is enough to meet a regular installment but not exceed:

    (i) The completion date of the facility; or

    (ii) The date when benefits from the facility begins; but

    (iii) In no case for more than 5 years for other than future water supply.

    (2) Payments will depend on the increased returns expected from planned improvements, or from the installation on individual farms of land development or other soil and water improvements essential for obtaining benefits from the improvement to be installed with loan funds.

    (3) They will not be used to permit the accelerated payment of other debts, to make capital improvements, or to create operating reserves.

    (4) Where prohibited by State statutes; interest payments will not be deferred even though payments on principal may be deferred.

    (5) Loans or advances for future water supply will be repaid within the life of the reservoir structure but in no event later than 50 years for WS and 30 years for RCD after the reservoir structure is built. Payments on the principal amount may be deferred one year after the water is first used from the storage capacity installed with the advance or for 10 years from the scheduled completion date of the structures, whichever occurs first.

    (i) Interest will begin for a future water supply as required by State law, or when water is first used from the future storage capacity or 10 years from the scheduled date of completion of the facility, whichever occurs first.

    (ii) If State law requires that interest be charged and repaid before water is first used or earlier than 10 years from completion date of the structure, interest payments will be scheduled to comply with State law even though payments of principal may be deferred.

    (iii) The borrower should be encouraged to begin repayments as soon as practicable after the reservoir is built even though this liberal deferment policy exists.

    (iv) WS advances for preservation of sites must be fully repaid before beginning construction of the works of improvement for which such sites were acquired.

    (A) Unless a WS advance is to be repaid with a WS loan, installments will be scheduled at the earliest possible date following the date of closing the advance. The date and amount of each such installment will be fixed to coincide with the receipt of income from taxes or other revenues.

    (B) Payments for both principal and interest on a WS advance for preservation of sites may be scheduled for payment in one installment to be paid on the date of the closing of a WS loan which includes funds for the repayment of the WS advance.

    (C) Interest on a WS advance for preservation of sites will begin on the date the WS advance is closed.

    (d)  (1) A borrower may make prepayments on WS loans, WS advances or RCD loans in any amount at any time.

    (2) Payments will be applied first to interest accrued to the date of the receipt of payment, and second to the principal balance. If the regular payments plus any prepayments exceed the cumulative amount due, the excess payments will be applied on the next installment first to interest, then principal. Loan refunds and proceeds from the sale of security property, however, will be applied on the final unpaid installment.

    (3) Payments will be scheduled annually beginning one year following the date of loan closing or one year following the end of any approved deferment period, unless another annual due date is required by State statute or upon prior written authorization from the National Office. In those cases where loans are being made under statutes requiring a repayment date other than this, the Rural Development State Director will send a copy of the Regional Attorney's opinion that such is required, to the Finance Office.

    (4) When a single obligation instrument is used, amortized installments will be required. When this cannot be done because of state law, serial bonds or a single bond having installments of principal plus interest, stated separately, will be used. In cases where the payment of interest has been deferred, all collections will be applied to interest until such interest has been paid. Also, when a full installment is not paid when due, the payment made will be applied first to accrued interest.

    (5) In cases where the indebtedness will be represented by serial bonds or a single bond having installments of principal plus interest, stated separately, annual payments of principal and interest will be scheduled to permit them to be paid in amounts approximately equal to the amounts that would be required for annual amortized installments.

    (6) If the borrower will be retiring other debts represented by bonds or notes, the payment on such bonds may be considered in developing the payment schedule for the RUS loan. In some cases, it may be desirable to reduce the amount of payments to RUS in the early years of the loan in order to preclude the necessity for refinancing the outstanding debt. When such payment schedules are proposed, National Office authorization will be obtained prior to loan approval.

    (7)  Insofar as loan payments are consistent with income availability, applicable State statutes, and commercial customs in the preparation of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness, they should be scheduled on a monthly basis either in the bond or other evidence of indebtedness or through the use of a supplemental agreement. Such requirements will be accomplished not later than the time of loan closing. When monthly payments are required, such payments will be scheduled beginning one full month following the date of loan closing or the end of any approved deferment period. Subsequent monthly payments will be scheduled each full month thereafter. In those cases where evidence of indebtedness calls for annual or semiannual payments, they will be scheduled beginning six or twelve full months, respectively following the date of loan closing or the end of any approved deferment period. Subsequent payments will be scheduled each sixth or twelfth full month respectively, thereafter. When the evidence of indebtedness is dated the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month, the payment date will be scheduled the 28th day of the month.

    § 1781.9   Security, feasibility, evidence of debt, title, insurance and other requirements.

#### § § 1781.9

    (a)  WS loans, WS advances, and RCD loans will be secured in accordance with applicable provisions of § 1780.14 of this chapter.

    (b)  All projects financed under the provisions of this part must be based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other satisfactory sources in an amount that will provide for facility operation and maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and payment of the debt. The Rural Development State Director may obtain needed assistance in determining economic feasibility from officials of NRCS and other appropriate USDA agencies. See § 1780.7(f) of this chapter for applicable economic feasibility requirements and feasibility reports.

    (c)  See subpart D of part 1780 of this chapter for applicable requirements and provisions.

    (d)  See § 1780.39(g) of this chapter for requirements.

    (e)  The requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 ) as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4003 ) will be complied with in accordance with applicable provisions of RD Instruction 1901-L. Also see § 1780.39(g) of this chapter.

    (f)  See subpart C of part 1780 of this chapter for applicable provisions.

    (g)  (1) Title evidence for land, easements, and rights-of-way to be acquired with proceeds of loans or advances will be furnished by the sponsoring local organization in accordance with NRCS policies and procedures.

    (2) RUS will specify and approve the form and content of instruments for conveying title to or interest in real estate on which a lien will be taken to secure a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan. These should be consistent with the applicable provisions of § 1780.14 of this chapter. The Rural Development State Director will make his decision after consultation with the Regional Attorney and the State Conservationist. He will notify NRCS in writing of his decision. Thereafter, title clearance will be completed under NRCS regulations except that a marketable title must be obtained on any tract of land, a part of which will be sold as excess land in accordance with § 1781.6(a)(9). In addition to the title evidence required by NRCS, applicants will furnish an opinion of legal counsel on all land and interest in land acquired with loan or advance funds.

    (h)  The amounts paid for lands, rights, and facilities with loan funds will be not more than that determined to be reasonable and fair by the loan approval official based upon an appraisal of the current market value made by an Rural Development employee or an independent appraiser.

    (i)  Applicants will be required to comply with applicable State and local laws and regulations governing appropriating, diverting, storing and using water, changing the place and manner of use of water, and in disposing of water. All of the rights of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water from any source will be fully honored in all respects as they may be affected by facilities installed with WS loans and advances and RCD loans. If, under the provisions of State law, notice of the proposed diversion or storage of water by the applicant may be filed, the applicant will be required to file such a notice. An applicant must furnish evidence to provide reasonable assurance that its water rights will be or have been properly established, will not interfere with prior vested rights, will likely not be contested or enjoined by other water users or riparian owners, and will be within the provisions of any applicable interstate compact.

    § 1781.10   [Reserved]

#### § § 1781.10

    § 1781.11   Other considerations.

#### § § 1781.11

    (a)  When pipelines from reservoirs to treatment plants are included in watershed work plans, NRCS will not furnish engineering services for their design or installation. When such pipelines are to be financed by WS or RCD loans, RUS will supervise the activities of the private engineers retained for the purpose. Such RUS supervision will include, among other things, approval of private engineer's contracts, approval of plans and specifications, authorization of contract awards, spot checks of engineering inspection, and final inspection and acceptance.

    (b)  Applicants will be responsible for providing the services necessary to plan projects including design of facilities, preparation of cost and income estimates, development of proposals for organization and financing, and overall operation and maintenance of the facility. Necessary professional services may include such as that of an engineer, architect, attorney, bond counsel, accountant, auditor, and financial advisor or fiscal agent. Form RD 442-19, “Agreement for Engineering Services,” may be used when appropriate. RUS Bulletin 1780-7, “Legal Service Agreement” may be used to prepare the agreement for legal services.

    (c)  Contracts for other services such as management, operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to the RUS official developing the docket for review and approval.

    (d)  Fees provided for in contracts, agreements or services will not be more than those ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work when RUS financing is not involved.

    (e)  Facilities will be designed, installed and operated to prevent pollution of water in excess of established standards. Effluent disposal will conform with appropriate State and Federal Water Pollution Control Standards.

    (f)  When repayment of a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan will be dependent upon income from the use or sale of water, RUS approval will be contingent upon a determination that the proposed use of stored water for recreation or municipal supply might not be permitted by a State health department because the water is being polluted from an upstream or other source.

    (g)  Actions will be taken to comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. When environmental assessments and environmental impact statements have been prepared on WS plans or RCD area plans by NRCS, a separate environmental impact statement or assessment on WS works of improvement or RCD measures for which a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is requested will not be necessary unless the NRCS environmental review fails to meet the requirements of 7 CFR part 1970. If the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment is satisfactory, the Agency should formally adopt the document in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. If a determination is made that further analysis of the environmental impact is needed, the Agency will make necessary arrangements with the NRCS State Conservationist for such action to be taken before a loan is made.

    (h)  All projects will comply with the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 ) in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-F.

    (i)  Recipients of WS loans, WS advances, or RCD loans are subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d ), which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, or national origin. Borrowers must agree not to discriminate in their operations by signing Form RD 400-4, “Nondiscrimination Agreement,” before loan closing. This requirement should be discussed with the applicant as early in the negotiations as possible. Necessary actions will be taken in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-E.

    (j)  When required by the Rural Development State Director, appraisals will be made by an Rural Development official designated or an independent appraiser. Form RD 442-10, “Appraisal Report—Water and Waste Disposal Systems,” with appropriate supplements, may be modified as needed for use with the type of facilities being appraised.

    (k)  All facilities financed with RUS loans and grants which are accessible to the public or in which physically handicapped persons may be employed or reside must be developed in compliance with this act (42 U.S.C. 4151 ).

    (2) The Rural Development State Director will request the NRCS State Conservationist to provide information justifying the WS advance along with a written recommendation that it be made. This will include:

    (i) Economic feasibility of the proposed WS advance.

    (ii) Evidence of the legal authority of the sponsoring local organization to incur the obligation and make required payments.

    (iii) Any limitations on the issuance of additional bonds or notes which may be imposed by the provisions of bond ordinances or on resolutions which authorize the issuance of any outstanding obligation of the sponsoring local organization.

    (iv) The amount of WS advance funds to be provided, purpose for which funds will be used, and date funds will be needed.

    (3) When the above information has been made available to the Rural Development State Director, he will send written recommendations concerning further action on the WS advance request to the NRCS State Conservationist including actions to be taken in the preparation of the WS advance docket.

    (c)  If an applicant requests both a WS loan and WS advance, the application for the WS loan should indicate the amount of the WS advance needed and whether a request for it has been made to NRCS. The Rural Development State Director and the NRCS State Conservationist will coordinate applicable processing actions of such applications. When the Rural Development State Director determines that favorable consideration will be given to an application for a loan or advance, he will provide instructions to the processing office for completing and processing the appropriate docket. Any questions concerning eligibility or other legal matters should be cleared with the Regional Attorney.

    (d)  When it is determined that the preapplication or application cannot be given favorable consideration, the Rural Development State Director will return it to the processing office along with written reasons. When the processing office receives this information, it will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state that the RUS Administrator may be requested to review the decision. This action will be taken in accordance with § 1780.37 of this chapter.

    (1) Upon receipt of the State Office copy of a review request from the applicant, the Rural Development State Director will furnish a report on the matter to the Administrator.

    (2) The Administrator will notify the applicant and the Rural Development State Director in writing of his decision and the reasons therefore.

#### § § 1781.14

    (a) WS and RCD area plans are developed by sponsoring local agencies and organizations with technical assistance from NRCS and other Federal and State agencies. These plans include WS works of improvement and RCD measures to be developed or constructed for which NRCS construction funds may be made available on a cost share basis along with funds provided by the sponsoring local organization, a portion or all of which may be obtained by a WS loan and/or WS advance or a RCD loan.

    (b) Current information on the availability of cost share funds and purposes for which they may be used is provided by NRCS. The amount of NRCS cost share funds and the amount of funds to be provided by the sponsoring local organizations will be indicated in each plan. The estimated amount of WS loan, WS advance or RCD loan anticipated by the sponsoring local organization should also be included.

    (c) Plans for the development or construction of individual WS works of improvement and RCD measures will normally be developed with NRCS technical assistance. In every case they will be approved by both the NRCS State conservationist and the Rural Development State Director or their designated agent when a WS loan, WS advance or RCD loan is made.

    (d) Options and appraisals related to the purchase of real estate for which a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is made must be developed in accordance with NRCS and RUS requirements and approved by RUS.

#### § § 1781.16

    § 1781.17   Docket preparation and processing.

#### § § 1781.17

    (a)  Dockets for WS loans, WS advances and RCD loans will be prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1780 of this chapter.

    (1)  Docket preparation may begin as soon as a preliminary draft of the watershed plan or RCD area plan, together with an estimate of costs and benefits, have been prepared with the assistance of NRCS and approved by the sponsoring local organization applicant. However, the applicant must understand that approval of the WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan will not be determined until the work plan has been authorized for assistance by NRCS. To the extent practicable, docket preparation may be completed by that time to facilitate the availability of funds when needed.

    (2)  When the Rural Development State Director has determined that plans and other requirements are completed to the extent that preparation of the loan docket may begin, he will send the processing office a memorandum giving complete instructions for docket preparation, with a list of documents to be included in the docket.

    (3)  The docket should include information for use in determining that:

    (i) The sponsoring local organization:

    (A) Has legal authority to construct and operate the proposed facility, borrow money, give security, incur debt, and generate revenue needed for operation, maintenance, reserves, debt payment, and other cash requirements.

    (B) Is a sponsor or cosponsor of the WS plan or RCD work plan and is otherwise eligible for assistance.

    (ii) Funds will be used for authorized purposes.

    (iii) The source of income to be pledged for debt payment and the security proposed is adequate.

    (iv) Actions required for loan closing are administratively satisfactory, legally sufficient and properly documented in accordance with Agency regulations.

    (4)  The docket will be assembled in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and will include the following:

    (i) A copy of the WS works of improvement agreement or RCD measure agreement.

    (ii) A copy of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement between NRCS and the WS or RCD sponsoring local organization for the WS works of improvement or the RCD measure.

    (iii) A statement from the NRCS State Conservationist concurring in the feasibility of the WS work of improvement or RCD measure and that NRCS is providing financial and/or technical assistance in accordance with applicable WS or RCD authorities.

    (5)  This should be included in or attached to the Project Summary. It should relate project costs to benefits of the WS or RCD loan or WS advance. Minimum and average individual charges, tax levies or assessments should be given where applicable. Where taxes or assessments on land will be levied, acres should be indicated and average cost per acre should be given. Analyses of income from recreational facilities should be based on the best information available from local, State, and Federal agencies concerned with such recreation facilities. Determination of water rates, schedules, and estimated consumption of water should be made by the same methods as for loans for domestic water and irrigation.

    (6)  The docket should include, as part of the Project Summary, current estimated costs of easements, rights-of-way, and other land rights which must be acquired. The amount estimated for such purposes in the WS or RCD plan should reflect current conditions.

    (b) —(1)  The processing office will check the docket for accuracy and completeness and forward it to the State Office with their recommendations. The Rural Development State Director will review the docket to determine that:

    (i) All documents are accurate and complete.

    (ii) The proposed loan complies with WS and RCD program policies and procedures of both RUS and NRCS.

    (iii) Security is adequate and the repayment plan is sound.

    (iv) Funds requested are for authorized purposes.

    (v) Actions are in compliance with requirements of applicable Federal and State laws.

    (2)  When the Rural Development State Director determines that the docket is complete and the proposed activity is feasible, he will prepare a proposed letter of conditions under which the application may be further processed. The letter will be delivered to and discussed with the applicant. Upon acceptance of the conditions the applicant will indicate intentions to meet the conditions by a letter of interest and the application will be further processed.

    (3)  The complete docket and proposed letter of conditions will be forwarded to the Regional Attorney, OGC for review and preparation of closing instructions. If it is not possible to issue closing instructions at that time, the Regional Attorney, will issue a preliminary legal opinion commenting upon the applicants legal existence, authority to incur debt and give security for the WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan requested and actions to be taken before closing instructions may be issued.

    (4)  When the Rural Development State Director receives closing instructions or a preliminary legal opinion for a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan that is not within his approval authority he will send this information along with the docket, the proposed letter of conditions, and a memorandum recommending approval to the National Office. A copy of his memorandum will be sent to the processing office. If the proposed action is within the Rural Development State Director's approval authority he need not submit the material listed in this paragraph (b)(4) to the National Office unless he wants review and comments before approval.

    (c)  (1) When the Rural Development State Director has concurred with the NRCS State Conservationist in the inclusion of a WS advance in a watershed plan, preparation of the advance docket can be initiated and will be processed in the same manner as for a WS loan. Where both a WS loan and WS advance are planned only one docket will be prepared to include both the WS loan and WS advance.

    (2) If the advance appears to be sound and proper, the Rural Development State Director will send a proposed memorandum of concurrence to the NRCS State Conservationist. The memorandum will state that RUS concurs in the execution of a work of improvement agreement for which NRCS will obligate advance funds and that RUS will accept the proposed obligations of the applicant to repay the advance subject to conditions specified in or attached to the memorandum. These conditions will include all appropriate requirements in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and will specify compliance with closing instructions issued by the Regional Attorney. It will also indicate that preparation of the WS advance docket will be in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

    (3) The Rural Development State Director and the NRCS State Conservationist will sign the memorandum of concurrence to NRCS when:

    (i) It has been determined that funds for the advance will be obligated by NRCS; and

    (ii) The WS advance docket, has been approved; and

    (iii) Closing instructions have been issued by the Regional Attorney; and

    (iv) The Rural Development State Director and NRCS State Conservationist have determined that the applicant can comply with all requirements of the letter of conditions and closing instructions.

    § 1781.18   Feasibility.

#### § § 1781.18

    (a) Before WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is approved, a determination of feasibility will be made by the Rural Development State Director based upon a review of plans developed in cooperation with NRCS personnel. The feasibility determination must have the concurrence of the NRCS State Conservationist before a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is approved.

    (b) A written assessment of the project's feasibility will be made by the processing office, Architect/Engineer, and Program Chief in their recommendations or comments on the Project Summary. These should reflect concurrence of the respective NRCS personnel in counterpart positions with whom they cooperate in administering these programs.

    § 1781.19   Approval, closing, and cancellation.

    (a) Approval and closing actions will be taken in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1780 of this chapter and the following requirements have been met:

    (1) The WS or RCD plan has been approved for operations by NRCS and the applicant is an official sponsoring or cosponsoring local organization for the plan as evidenced by being included in the list of sponsoring or co-sponsoring local organizations in the plan.

    (2) Closing instructions or a preliminary legal opinion has been prepared by the Regional Attorney.

    (3) The governing body of the applicant's sponsoring local organization has formally passed and approved the loan resolution.

    (4) The Rural Development State Director and NRCS State Conservationist have determined that all planned actions can be carried out as proposed in the project plan and the docket.

    (5) The NRCS State Conservationist and Rural Development State Director have mutually agreed on the priority to be given the WS loan or WS advance, or RCD loan. In making this determination, consideration will be given to the relative priority of the WS works of improvement or RCD measures to all other such work in the State and the anticipated availability of Federal and local funds to assure continuity of action and work until the project is completed. When funds are to be provided by NRCS for a WS or RCD loan or a WS advance such funds must be obligated by NRCS before closing.

    (6) Public bodies will be required to use bond counsel in accordance with subpart D of part 1780 of this chapter.

    (b) When favorable action is not taken on a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan, the Rural Development State Director will notify the NRCS State Conservationist and the applicant in writing and, if possible, arrange for a meeting of RUS and NRCS representatives with the applicant to explain the action. WS loans, WS advances, or RCD loans may be canceled before closing.

    § 1781.20   Disbursement of WS and RCD loan funds and WS advance funds.

#### § § 1781.20

    (a) WS and RCD loan funds will be disbursed by the processing office in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 1780.45 of this chapter and RUS Bulletin 1781-1, paragraph (5). Funds will be made available to the borrower as needed for payment of development or other costs for which the loan is made. The processing office must determine that the payment is for an authorized purpose and is for benefits accrued to the borrower. This will require evidence from NRCS in accordance with the applicable provisions of RUS Bulletin 1781-1, “Memorandum of Understanding Between RUS and NRCS.”

    (b) WS advance funds may be disbursed in the same manner as WS loan funds if such funds are transferred to RUS by NRCS for disbursement or they may be disbursed by NRCS. When WS advance funds are disbursed by NRCS, payments from advance of funds will be reported to the Rural Development State Director each month to be reported to the Finance Office and charged to the borrower's account. This action will be taken in accordance with the applicable provisions of RUS Bulletin 1781-1 or RUS Bulletin 1781-2 and agreement between the NRCS State Conservationist and Rural Development State Director as follows:

    (1) When a future water supply is being developed with NRCS, WS advance funds, the NRCS State Conservationist will send the Rural Development State Director a monthly report of funds disbursed. This will include three (3) copies of Form NRCS-AS-49a and 49b, “Contract Payment Estimate and Construction Progress Report,” along with a transmittal Memorandum showing the sequential number (first, second, third, etc.) of the payment, the amount and date of payment, the check number by which the payment was made and the cumulative amount of advance funds disbursed to date. When the works of improvement, for which WS advance funds are used is completed the final report will, in addition to the above, show the date that construction was completed and the total amount of WS advance funds used.

    (2) WS advances for construction costs will be set out each month on Form NRCS-49a. The Rural Development State Director should make arrangements with the NRCS State Conservationist to be supplied each month with a copy of Form NRCS 49a when advance funds are included together with an official statement from the NRCS State Administrative Officer giving the date of the check and the exact amount of each advance of funds made under the advance provisions of the project agreement or of any engineering services agreement or other supplementary agreement which further implements the proposal for the advance in the project agreement. The original will be sent immediately to the Finance Office and a copy provided for the processing office file.

    (3) When WS advance funds are used to acquire property for site preservation the same reporting procedure as for a future water supply will be used except that Form NRCS-AS-49a and 49b if used, should be adopted to indicate fund use. As payments are made on land on which a mortgage or other security instrument is required, such instruments will be executed in accordance with instructions from the Regional Attorney, OGC.

    (4) The Rural Development State Director must send the bond or note evidencing WS advance indebtedness of the borrower to the Finance Office along with reports of payments from advance funds disbursed by NRCS. A copy of the bond or note and copy of each report of payment will be sent to the processing office.

    (c)  Actions will be taken in accordance with § 1780.44 of this chapter.

    § 1781.21   Borrower accounting methods, management, reporting, and audits.

#### § § 1781.21

    § 1782.12   Sale or exchange of security property.

#### § § 1782.12

    A cash sale of all or a portion of a borrower's assets or an exchange of security property may be approved subject to the conditions set forth in this section.

    (a)  Approval may be given when the servicing official determines that:

    (1) The consideration is for the full amount of the debt or the present fair market value as determined by an appraisal completed by a qualified Rural Development employee or an independent appraiser as determined appropriate by the approval official;

    (2) The sale or exchange will not prevent carrying out the purpose of the loan;

    (3) The remaining property is adequate security for the loan and the transaction will not adversely affect the Agency's security position;

    (4) If the property to be sold or exchanged will be used for similar purposes that the loan was made, the purchaser will:

    (i) Execute Form RD 400-4, “Assurance Agreement.” The instrument of conveyance will contain the civil rights covenant referenced in 7 CFR 1901.202(e); and

    (ii) Provide the Agency with a written agreement assuming all rights and obligations of the original borrower, and

    (5) Proceeds remaining after paying any reasonable and necessary selling expenses are to be used for one or more of the following purposes:

    (i) To pay Agency debt, pay on debts secured by a prior lien, and pay on debts secured by a parity or subsequent lien if it is to the Agency's advantage;

    (ii) To purchase or acquire property more suited to the borrower's needs, providing the Agency's security position is maintained; and

    (iii) To develop or enlarge the facility if necessary to improve the borrower's debt-paying ability, place the operation on a sounder financial basis, or further the loan objectives and purposes.

    (b)  The requirements for the sale or disposition of assets financed with Agency grants are determined by the terms of the grant agreement, 7 CFR parts 3015, 3016, and 3019, and E.O. 12803, as applicable.

    (c)  If a borrower can no longer meet the objectives of the loan, the property may be sold. If the full amount of the borrower's debt is paid or assumed, the State Director may release the borrower from liability.

    § 1782.13   Transfer of security and assumption of loans.

#### § § 1782.13

    It is the Agency's policy to approve transfers and assumptions to transferees that will continue the original purpose of the loan. Assistant Administrator written concurrence is required when the transfer exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority. The transfer will be approved in accordance with the following requirements:

    (a)  The fulfillment of the following requirements for transfers will be determined by the approval official, in his or her discretion:

    (1) The transferees must meet the eligibility requirements of 7 CFR part 1780 and provide the same information required in 7 CFR part 1780, subpart B, for application processing.

    (2) The transfer will not be disadvantageous to the Government as determined by the approval official.

    (3) If the Agency debt(s) exceeds the present market value of the security as determined by an appraisal, the transferee will assume an amount at least equal to the present market value.

    (4) The Agency must concur in plans for disposition of funds in any reserve account, including project construction bank accounts. A reserve account may be considered as a transferable asset.

    (5) The transferee will assume all of the borrower's responsibilities regarding loans. The transferee will also agree to accept the original loan conditions plus any conditions set forth by the Agency with regard to the transfer.

    (6) A current appraisal will be completed to establish the present market value of the security when the full debt is not being assumed.

    (7) There must be no lien, judgement, or similar claims of other parties against the Agency security being transferred unless the transferee is willing to accept such claims. The Agency must also determine that the claims will not prevent the transferee from repaying the Agency debt, meeting all operating and maintenance costs, and maintaining required reserves. The written consent of any other lienholder will be obtained where required.

    (8) A letter of conditions establishing requirements to be met in connection with the transfer will be issued, and the transferee will be required to execute Form RD 1942-46, “Letter of Intent to Meet Conditions,” prior to closing of the transfer.

    (9) The transferee will obtain insurance according to Agency requirements.

    (10) The effective date of the transfer is the date the transfer is closed, which is the same date Form RD 1951-15, “Community Programs Assumption Agreement,” or other appropriate assumption agreement which is executed and delivered by all necessary parties.

    (11) Title to all assets will be conveyed from the transferor to the transferee unless all parties concerned, including the Agency, agree upon other arrangements. All instruments of conveyance will contain the necessary nondiscrimination covenant as referred to in § 1782.5.

    (12) If the transfer and assumption is to one or more members of the borrower's organization, there must not be a loss to the Government.

    (13) The State Director is authorized to approve transfers to eligible transferees at the same interest rate as on the borrower's note(s) or bond(s). The maturity of the debt instrument for the assumed debt may not exceed the lesser of the repayment period authorized in 7 CFR part 1780 for a “new” loan or the expected life of the facility.

    (14) Agency National Office concurrence is required for transfers not in compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (13) of this section.

    (b)  If a loan is evidenced and secured by a note and lien on real or chattel property, Form RD 1951-15, or other appropriate assumption agreement will be executed by the transferee. If a bond secures a loan, transfer documents will be developed by bond counsel and approved by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), USDA.

    (1) Loans being transferred and assumed may be combined when the security is the same, new terms are being provided, a new debt instrument will be issued, and the loans have the same interest rate and are for the same purpose. If applicable, 7 CFR part 1780 will govern the preparation of any new debt instruments required.

    (2) A loan may be made in connection with a transfer if the transferee meets all eligibility and other requirements for the kind of loan being made. Such a loan will be considered as a separate loan and must be evidenced by a separate debt instrument. However, it is permissible to have one authorizing loan resolution or ordinance if permitted by State statutes.

    (3) Any development funds remaining in a bank account that are not refunded to the Agency will be transferred to a bank account for the transferee. This will occur simultaneously with the closing of the transfer, and the funds will be used in completing planned development.

    (c)  Transferors may be released from liability when their debt is paid in full or when the debt is settled in accordance with § 1782.20 of this part.

    (d)  The requirements for the sale or disposition of assets financed with Agency grants are determined by the terms of the grant agreement, 7 CFR parts 3015, 3016, and 3019, and E.O. 12803, as applicable.

    § 1782.14   Protection of service areas—7 U.S.C. 1926(b).

#### § § 1782.14

    (a) 7 U.S.C. 1926(b) was enacted to protect the service area of Agency borrowers with outstanding loans, or those loans sold in the sale of assets authorized by the “Joint Resolution Making Continuing Appropriations for the Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341 (1986),” from loss of users due to actions or activities of other entities in the service area of the Agency financed system. Without this protection, other entities could extend service to users within the service area, and thereby undermine the purpose of the congressionally mandated water and waste loan and grant programs and jeopardize the borrower's ability to repay its Agency debt.

    (b) Responsibility for initiating action in response to those actions prohibited by 7 U.S.C. 1926(b) rests with the borrower.

    § 1782.15   Mergers and consolidations.

#### § § 1782.15

    Mergers and consolidations will be processed the same as a transfer and assumption, although approvals by the Agency will give consideration to the differences under the applicable law regarding the type of transaction under consideration and the unique facts involved in each transaction. Mergers occur when two or more entities combine in such a manner that only one remains in existence. Consolidations occur when two or more entities combine to form a new consolidated entity, and the original entities cease to exist. In both mergers and consolidations, the surviving or emerging entity acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity or entities that ceased to exist.

    § 1782.16   Defeasance of Agency indebtedness.

#### § § 1782.16

    Defeasance, or amending outstanding loan instruments and agreements to permit defeasance of Agency debt instruments, is prohibited.

    § 1782.17   Parity lien.

#### § § 1782.17

    In order for the Agency to agree to a parity lien position, the borrower must submit a written request to the servicing office.

    (a) The written request for parity must contain the following items:

    (1) An explanation of the purpose of the request for parity; amount of loan for which parity is requested; description of security property; type of security instrument; name and address of financial institution requesting the transaction; and other information determined necessary by the servicing official to evaluate the request.

    (2) Current financial statements or an audit, if available or determined necessary by the servicing official.

    (3) An annual operating budget which projects income and expenses for a typical year's operation. If construction is involved, the budget must be projected through the first full year of operation following completion of the planned improvements.

    (4) A copy of the proposed security instrument.

    (5) A certification from the borrower that the Agency debt cannot be refinanced at reasonable rates and terms.

    (6) An appraisal, when the primary security is real estate or determined necessary by the servicing official in order to determine the adequacy of loan security or repayment ability.

    (7) A certification that any development work will comply with subpart C of part 1780 of this chapter.

    (b) Requests for parity must comply with requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, requirements as specified in the bond or loan documents, the requirements as specified in 7 CFR part 1780, subpart D, and as provided in applicable State law.

    (c) If the borrower has met all of the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the proposal is determined to be in the Government's interest, the Agency will then grant approval of the borrower's request for parity. The following factors will be considered in assessing whether the request is in the Government's interest:

    (1) The value of the added assets compared with the amount of new debt to be secured;

    (2) The value of the assets already pledged under the security documents, and any effects of the proposed transaction on the value of those assets;

    (3) The ratio of the total outstanding debt secured under the security documents to the value of all assets pledged as security under the security documents;

    (4) The borrower's ability to repay its debt owed to the Government;

    (5) The overall financial viability of the borrower;

    (6) The borrower's current relationship with the Agency (i.e. no defaults under the loan documents);

    (7) Such other factors that may be relevant in individual cases, as determined by the Agency.

    § 1782.18   [Reserved]

#### § § 1782.18

    § 1782.19   Third party agreements.

#### § § 1782.19

    The State Director may authorize third party operation, maintenance, and management of an Agency financed facility. The borrower's attorney must review the contract, management agreement, written lease, or other third party agreement and issue an opinion to the Agency as to their legal sufficiency. The borrower shall retain the legal authority necessary for owning, constructing, operating, and maintaining the facility.

    § 1782.20   Debt Settlement.

#### § § 1782.20

    Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 1981, this section prescribes policies for debt settlement of Water and Waste Disposal loans; Watershed loans and advances; Resource Conservation and Development loans; and 306 (c) Water and Waste Facility loans. Within the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) is the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. This law provides that any non-tax debt or claim owed to the United States that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days shall be turned over to the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action to collect or terminate collection actions on the debt or claim. Debt that is in litigation or foreclosure, with a collection agency or designated Federal debt collection center, or that will be disposed of under an asset sales program, is exempt from transfer to the Secretary.

    (a)  (1) The debt or any extension thereof on which settlement is requested must be due and payable. The debt will be due and payable either under the terms of the note or other instrument, or by acceleration, unless the debt is to be cancelled without application under paragraph (e)(2) of this section or charged off under paragraph (f) of this section.

    (2) Normally, all security will be disposed of prior to the date of application for debt settlement unless it is necessary to abandon security through the debt settlement process. In such cases, debt settlement may proceed if the servicing official determines that further collection efforts would be ineffective, uneconomical, and not in the best interests of the Government.

    (3) Debtors will not be permitted to sell security and use the proceeds as part or all of a compromise/adjustment debt settlement offer.

    (4) Requests for debt settlement will consist of Form RD 1956-1 “Application For Settlement of Indebtedness,” current financial information, description and estimated market value of collateral, and status of operation (i.e., number of users, compliance with environmental issues, etc.).

    (5) Office of General Counsel (OGC) advice on compliance with State or Federal statutes that may affect the debt settlement action must be requested.

    (b)  Debts will not be settled if:

    (1) Referral to the Office of Inspector General and/or to OGC is contemplated or pending because of suspected criminal violation,

    (2) Civil action to protect the interest of the Government is contemplated or pending,

    (3) An investigation for suspected fiscal irregularity is contemplated or pending, or

    (4) The debtor requests settlement of a claim that has been referred to or a judgment obtained by the United States Attorney. The settlement offer and any related payment must be submitted directly to the United States Attorney for consideration.

    (c)  Typically, debt settlement will be accomplished through compromise/adjustment, charge-off, or cancellation. Any debt remaining after the security has been liquidated, by sale or transfer, will be cancelled if there are no other assets from which to collect the debt. The servicing official will proceed with advice from OGC and the National Office, as required.

    (d)  Debts may be compromised or adjusted and security retained by the debtor, provided:

    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the indebtedness in full,

    (2) The debtor has offered an amount equal to the present fair market value of all security or facility financed, and

    (3) The debtor has offered any additional amount that the debtor is able to pay.

    (e)  Non-judgment debts, regardless of the amount, may be cancelled with or without application by the debtor.

    (1)  Debts may be cancelled upon application of the debtor, subject to the following conditions:

    (i) The servicing official furnishes a favorable recommendation concerning the cancellation;

    (ii) There is no known security for the debt and the debtor has no other assets from which the debt could be collected;

    (iii) The debtor is unable to pay any part of the debt, and has no reasonable prospect of being able to do so; and

    (iv) The debt or any extension thereof is due and payable under the terms of the note or other instrument or due to acceleration by written notice prior to the date of application.

    (2)  Debts may be cancelled upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official in the following instances:

    (i)  If there is no security for the debt, debts discharged in bankruptcy shall be cancelled by the use of Form RD 1956-1. A copy of the Bankruptcy Court's Discharge Order must be attached.

    (ii)  Debts may be cancelled if it is impractical to obtain a signed application and the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) of this section are met. Form RD 1956-1 will document the specific reason(s) why it was impossible or impracticable to obtain the signature of the debtor. If the debtor refused to sign the application, the reason(s) should be documented.

    (f) —(1)  Judgment debts, regardless of the amount, may be charged off without the debtor's signature upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official provided:

    (i) The United States Attorney's file is closed, and

    § 1782.23   Use of Rural Development loans and grants for other purposes.

#### § § 1782.23

    (a) If, after making a loan or a grant, the Administrator determines that the circumstances under which the loan or grant was made have sufficiently changed to make the project or activity for which the loan or grant was made available no longer appropriate, the Administrator may allow the borrower or grantee to use property (real and personal) purchased or improved with the loan or grant funds, or proceeds from the sale of property (real and personal) purchased with such funds, for another project or activity that:

    (1) Will be carried out in the same area as the original project or activity;

    (2) Meets the criteria for a loan or grant described in section 381E(d) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (Pub. L. 87-128), as amended; and

    (3) Satisfies such additional requirements as are established by the Administrator.

    (b) If the new use of the property is under the authority of another USDA Agency Administrator, the other Administrator will be consulted on whether the new use will meet the criteria of the other program. Since the new project or activity must be carried out in the same area as the original project or activity, a new rural area determination will not be necessary.

    (c) Borrowers and grantees that wish to use the proceeds for other purposes may make their request through the appropriate Rural Development State Office. Permission to use this option will be exercised on a case-by-case-basis on applications submitted through the State Office to the Administrator for consideration. If the proposal is approved, the Administrator will issue a memorandum to the State Director outlining the conditions necessary to complete the transaction.

The ANTHC shall notify the funding agencies and the IHS if a change in the project or project scope occurs which could change any previously prepared environmental findings or determinations or could adversely impact the environment. In the event of an unanticipated discovery of a historic property or other environmental resource, the ANTHC shall stop construction activity in the area of the discovery and notify the appropriate authority and the IHS. Mitigation options resulting from unanticipated discoveries, including but not limited to changes in project scope or cancellation of the project will be evaluated by the funding agencies in collaboration with the ANTHC and IHS. If appropriate and necessary, mitigation plans will be negotiated and approved by all parties. When the funding agencies have approved a mitigation plan and IHS has reaffirmed its environmental review process, including all findings and determinations, the ANTHC will be authorized to initiate the agreed to mitigation plan. The IHS shall bear no mitigation costs as it is not a funding agency for projects under this part.

      (g) RUS will have an opportunity to review the IHS or DEC environmental review documents, including all findings and determinations to ensure consistency with this part and agency procedures. Where an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required by the lead agency's environmental policies and procedures, the lead agency will ensure that the scope and content of the EA or EIS satisfies the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to RUS. Where an EA and EIS is not required under the applicable lead agency's procedures for implementing NEPA, the review by RUS will be limited to ensure that the applicable lead agency's procedures were followed.

      (h) The National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 review requirements completed for ANTHC administered projects will be carried out in accordance with the process described in Appendix B of the June 15, 2011 MOU.

      (c)  A borrower who qualifies pursuant to § 1786.28(a) may at its option elect to use a private loan to make a prepayment, or a portion of a prepayment, pursuant to this subpart. Private loans, the proceeds of which are used exclusively to prepay FFB loans, shall be eligible for a guarantee under this subpart. The Administrator shall endorse a guarantee on each note evidencing a qualifying private loan. The private loan shall be structured in a manner which in the judgment of RUS shall not result in an increase in loan guarantee risk and shall comply with the following:

      (1) The private loan shall provide for the periodic payment of interest by the borrower not less frequently than annually, at either a variable or fixed rate in a manner which shall not result in an increase in loan guarantee risk.

The loan documentation shall also provide RUS with a right, upon the occurrence of such an “Event of Default,” to accelerate payment on its guarantee and accelerate payment on the note evidencing the private loan on the earlier of any date the interest rate on the private loan is reset, without premium or penalty; any date the borrower may prepay in accordance with the terms of the private loan, or the tenth anniversary of the date the private loan first bears interest at a fixed interest rate.

      (7) The principal of the private loan shall not include amounts attributable to fees associated with the private loan. At the time it submits its application, a borrower may request that the Administrator approve the inclusion of amounts attributable to fees as part of the interest rate on the private loan, if the net effective interest rate including such fees meets the test contained in § 1786.28(c)(1). For the purposes of these regulations, such financed fees shall be considered “interest”.

      (8) Private loans and guaranteed notes evidencing private loans shall otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator.

      (d)  Qualifying borrowers may elect to utilize internally generated funds without a guarantee to prepay an FFB loan, or partially prepay an FFB loan, pursuant to this subpart, if

      (1) The borrower notifies RUS, of its intent to prepay using internally generated funds in accordance with the application procedures set forth in this subpart; and

      § 1786.29   Prepayment authority, program allocations, categories of prepayment applications and financially distressed borrowers' reserve.

#### § § 1786.29

      (a)  So long as the aggregate amount of prepayments made after December 22, 1987, including prepayments made pursuant to § 1786.28(d) and § 1786.28(e), under section 306(A) of the RE Act, does not exceed $2.5 billion, the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury is not required in order to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart (such amount of prepayments is hereinafter called prepayment authority).

      (b)  In accordance with the provisions of section 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act, $350 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed electric systems and $150 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed telephone utilities. The amounts of prepayment authority allocated to electric program borrowers and telephone program borrowers shall not be transferred between programs. Borrowers may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer prepayment authority to another borrower.

      (c)  Applications received by RUS from borrowers desiring to prepay pursuant to this subpart will be separated into the following two application categories:

      (1)  Electric program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed electric utilities, that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period. Electric program applications will be further subdivided and classified as being either (i) a financially distressed borrower's application, or (ii) a standard electric program application. Applications received from borrowers determined by the Administrator not to be a financially distressed borrower will be classified and processed as a standard electric program application;

      (2)  Telephone program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed telephone utilities that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period;

      (d)  The $350 million of prepayment authority allocated for RUS-financed electric utilities, is initially set aside into a financially distressed borrowers' reserve. This reserve of prepayment authority will be available for prepayments pursuant to this subpart by financially distressed borrowers who apply to make such a prepayment during the application period. In the event that a portion of financially distressed borrowers' reserve remains unsubscribed at the end of the initial application period, the unallocated portion of the financially distressed borrowers' reserve will be allocated to other electric borrowers having submitted applications during an application period to be announced by RUS. Such prepayment applications shall be classified as standard electric program applications.

      § 1786.30   Processing procedure.

#### § § 1786.30

      (a)  The determination of the order or method in which applications or portions of applications will be processed by RUS pursuant to this subpart rests solely within the discretion of the Administrator. RUS expects that a number of prepayment applications will be processed simultaneously. In the event that it becomes necessary to establish priorities of processing, prepayment applications will be processed without regard to the date received, generally in the following order of priority:

      (1) Applications from telephone borrowers;

      (2) Applications from financially distressed borrowers;

      (3) Applications from all other borrowers. When assigning priority to such applications, RUS will consider a number of factors, including without limitation, (i) the number of prepayment applications being processed by the area office; (ii) the novelty or complexity of the proposed transaction; (iii) the method of prepayment; and (iv) the availability of resources. In the event that RUS receives during the initial application period, prepayment applications from such borrowers in an amount less than remaining prepayment authority for each respective program, RUS will establish a new application period and publish a notice to that effect in the

      (b)  Standard electric program applications, and telephone program applications will be prorated within their respective application categories to permit partial prepayments in the event that the aggregate amount of prepayment applications received during the application period exceeds the amount of prepayment authority allocated to that application category. In such circumstances, the amount of each borrower's permitted prepayment shall be determined within each respective application category, as follows:

      (1) The principal amount of FFB advances under each individual application, which, if prepaid pursuant to this subpart, would result in an economic savings to the borrower, shall be divided by the aggregate principal amount of FFB advances, under all of the applications, which, if prepaid pursuant to this subpart, would result in an economic savings to the borrowers, in order to determine a percentage (hereinafter called a pro-rated percentage) for each borrower;

      (2) Each borrower's share of the prepayment authority for its application category shall be equal to the product of (i) the prepayment authority times (ii) the respective pro-rated percentage, and may be used to prepay a portion of any of the borrower's FFB loans listed pursuant to § 1786.31(a)(2);

      (3) If any approved prepayment transaction fails to be settled within 180 days of the date the borrower is notified by RUS of its prepayment allocation, RUS may rescind its approval. The unused prepayment authority represented by such a failed transaction is subject to being included in any subsequent notice of a new application period under this subpart; and

      (4) In the event that applications from financially distressed borrowers exceed the amount prepayment authority remaining in the financially distressed borrowers' reserve, the Administrator at his discretion shall select one or more of such applications and allocate the reserve. In making such a selection and allocation, the Administrator may consider various factors, including without limitation, (i) the dollar amount of savings to be realized by the proposed prepayment; (ii) the interest rates on the FFB loans proposed to be prepaid; (iii) the magnitude of the default or potential default; and (iv) whether the borrower has previously completed a prepayment under section 306(A).

      (c)  Promptly after allocating the prepayment authority to borrowers and completing any proration calculations that may be necessary, RUS will return to each borrower submitting a prepayment application pursuant to this subpart, a copy of their Notice of Intent to Prepay the Federal Financing Bank specifying the amount of the borrower's prepayment allocation.

#### § § 1786.152

      An electric loan made under the RE Act shall not be sold or prepaid at a value that is less than the outstanding principal balance, except that, on request of a borrower, an electric loan made under the RE Act, or a portion of such a loan, that was advanced before May 1, 1992, or has been advanced for not less than 2 years, shall be prepaid by the borrower at the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the discounted present value thereof.

      § 1786.153   Discounted present value.

#### § § 1786.153

      (a) The discounted present value shall be calculated by summing the present values of all remaining payments on all Qualified Notes to be prepaid according to the following formula and adjusted as provided in paragraph (b) of this section if tax exempt financing is used.

      (b)(1) In the event that the borrower prepays a loan under paragraph (a) of this section using, directly or indirectly, tax exempt financing, the discount shall be adjusted to ensure that the borrower receives a benefit that is no greater than the benefit the borrower would receive if the borrower used financing that was not tax exempt. The borrower shall certify in writing whether the financing will be tax exempt.

      (2) The discount rate established in paragraph (a) of this section shall be adjusted for a tax exempt financing by substituting for the “I” term in the discount rate formula, a discount rate equal to the interest rate(s) published pursuant to 7 CFR 1714.5, determination of interest rates on municipal rate loans. This is the interest rate established for the new RUS loan program which is based on municipal interest rates for issues of comparable maturity. No interpolation or average will be used. If a note is to be prepaid under this subpart and is subject to this tax exempt adjustment, the discount rate will be determined from the published table in the  For example, if the note to be discounted matures in the year 1999 then the discount rate will be the interest rate for the year 1999. RUS will publish a schedule of interest rates for municipal rate loans in the  at the beginning of each calendar quarter. The published rates in effect eight business days prior to closing will be used for the discount rates. All notes to be prepaid that have remaining years to maturity of more than 20 years will be discounted at the interest rate in effect for new RUS municipal rate loans of comparable maturity at the time of closing.

During the 120 month period the Administrator may consider providing an insured loan if, among other matters, it is necessary to assure repayment of, or protect the Government's security for any outstanding loans or loan guarantees, or the borrower's system has suffered severe physical plant related damage due to conditions beyond its control and the borrower is unable to obtain financing at reasonable terms to restore the system from non-RUS sources, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and from private sources. Upon expiration of the 120 months, such borrowers may apply for direct or insured loans in the same manner as other borrowers provided that such borrowers may not apply for direct or insured loans for facilities, construction of which commenced prior to the expiration of the 120 months. Special provisions for mergers involving a borrower that has prepaid pursuant to this subpart are in 7 CFR 1717.158.

      (a) A premium shall be assessed against a borrower that refinances or prepays a loan or loan advance, or any portion of a loan or advance, under this section. RUS will collect the prepayment premium as calculated by FFB. FFB will calculate this premium as described in this section. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the premium shall be equal to the lesser of:

      (1) The difference between the outstanding principal balance of the loan being refinanced and the present value of the loan discounted at a rate equal to the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the loan being refinanced or prepaid;

      (2) 100 percent of the amount of interest for 1 year on the outstanding principal balance of the loan or loan advance, or any portion of the loan or advance, being refinanced, multiplied by the ratio that:

      (i) The number of quarterly payment dates between the date of the refinancing or prepayment and the maturity date for the loan advance; bears to

      (ii) The number of quarterly payment dates between the first quarterly payment date that occurs 12 years after the end of the year in which the amount being refinanced was advanced and the maturity date of the loan advance; and

      (3)(i) The present value of 100 percent of the amount of interest for 1 year on the outstanding principal balance of the loan or loan advance, or any portion of the loan or advance, being refinanced or prepaid; plus

      (ii) For the interval between the date of the refinancing or prepayment and the first quarterly payment date that occurs 12 years after the end of the year in which the amount being refinanced or prepaid was advanced, the present value of the difference between:

      (A) Each payment scheduled for the interval on the loan amount being refinanced or prepaid; and

      (B) The payment amounts that would be required during the interval on the amounts being refinanced or prepaid if the interest rate on the loan were equal to the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the loan being refinanced or prepaid.

      (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the premium provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be required for refinancing or prepayment under this section.

      (2) In the case of a loan advanced under an agreement that permits the refinancing or prepayment of the loan advance based on the payment of 1 year of interest on the outstanding principal balance of the loan advance, a borrower may, in lieu of the premium required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, pay a premium as provided by:

      (i) Paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the loan advance has reached the 12-year maturity required under the loan agreement for the refinancing or prepayment; or

      (ii) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the loan advance has not reached the 12-year maturity required under the loan agreement for the refinancing or prepayment.

      § 1786.208   Increased principal.

#### § § 1786.208

      A borrower can meet the premium requirements by increasing the outstanding principal balance of the loan advance that is being refinanced. If it does so the borrower shall make a payment at the time of the refinancing equal to 2.5 percent of the amount of the premium that is added to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.

      § 1786.209   Outstanding loan documents.

#### § § 1786.209

      (a) Except as expressly provided in this subpart, the borrower shall comply with all provisions of its RUS loan contract, its outstanding notes issued to RUS, and the RUS mortgage.

      (b) Nothing in this subpart shall affect any rights of supplemental lenders under the RUS mortgage or the rights of any other creditors of the borrower.

      (c) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit a borrower from making prepayments on any loans pursuant to the RE Act in accordance with the terms thereof or as may be otherwise permitted by law.

      § 1786.210   Approvals.

#### § § 1786.210

      The borrower shall be responsible for obtaining all approvals necessary to consummate the transaction as required by the refinancing note, including such approvals as may be required by regulatory bodies and other lenders.

  PART 1787—THE “BUY AMERICAN” REQUIREMENT

### Part 1787

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 903.

**Source:** Source: 83 FR 60730, Nov. 27, 2018, unless otherwise noted.

    § 1787.1   General.

#### § § 1787.1

    (a) The “Buy American” provision of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) requires, to the extent practicable and the cost of which is not unreasonable, that RUS Borrowers use loan funds only for such manufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have been manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country, substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States or any eligible country.

    (b) Each RUS Borrower is responsible for assuring that its use of loan funds complies with this requirement, and that the contracts it enters into for construction, materials and equipment, and purchases with vendors contain the Buy American requirement, along with certification as to compliance, made through RUS Form 213.

    § 1787.2   Definitions.

#### § § 1787.2

    For purpose of this part, the following terms have the following meanings:

    The Administrator of the RUS, or his/her designee.

    A provision of the RE Act requiring that loan funds only be used to purchase products made in the U.S. or an eligible country.

    Any article, material, or supply, whether manufactured or unmanufactured, that is directly incorporated into the end product at the final assembly location.

    A product or like product which both:

    (1) Is manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country; and

    (2) Contains components manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country consisting of more than 50 percent of the total cost of all components used in the product.

    Any country that the United States Trade Representative determines as having corporations located therein, as eligible to enter into contract with an RUS Borrower, under which loan funds will be provided for unmanufactured and manufactured goods.

    Funds provided under an RUS direct or guaranteed loan.

    The application of processes to alter the form or function of materials or of elements of the product such that value is added or the materials or elements are transformed into a new end product functionally different from that which would result from mere assembly of the materials or elements.

    An offer to sell a nondomestic product to an RUS borrower.

    Any product other than a domestic product or product from an eligible country.

    An item of manufactured material or assembled components, which is complete and capable of performing an intended practical purpose.

    Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 ).

    Any organization that has an outstanding RUS loan made or guaranteed by RUS pursuant to the RE Act.

    Any communication service for the transmission or reception of voice, data, sounds, signals, pictures, writings, or signs of all kinds, by wire, fiber, radio, light, or other visual or electromagnetic means, including all telephone lines, facilities, or systems used in the rendition of such service; but shall not be deemed to mean message telegram service or community antenna television system services or broadcasting facilities other than those intended exclusively for educational purposes, or radio broadcasting services or facilities within the meaning of section 3(o) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

    With respect to articles, materials, or supplies, refers to such goods that have not been manufactured.

    § 1787.3   Products constituting a portion of a purchase order or contract.

#### § § 1787.3

    Where a supplier or contractor offers or furnishes several products under a purchase order or contract, the provisions of this part apply to each product individually.

    § 1787.4   Unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies.

#### § § 1787.4

    The Buy American requirement also applies to unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies to be financed with RUS loan funds, and will be considered domestic if mined or produced in the United States or in an eligible country.

    § 1787.5   Eligible countries.

#### § § 1787.5

    The United State Trade Representative (USTR) determines what countries are eligible countries with respect to purchases made by electric borrowers or telecommunications borrowers. A particular country may be determined to be an eligible country for purchases made by telecommunications borrowers, for electric borrowers, or both. RUS maintains the latest  notice on its website which sets out the list of Eligible Countries for each RUS program at

    § 1787.6   Nondomestic products.

#### § § 1787.6

    A product is considered to be nondomestic for the purpose of compliance with the “Buy American” requirement if:

    (a) The product is manufactured outside the United States or any eligible country; or

    (b) The product is manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country, but the cost of nondomestic components used therein constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of all components. The cost of components shall be determined on a comparable basis, so that only the cost of domestic and nondomestic components, up to the point where they are combined and manufactured into a complete product shall be considered.

    (1) The determination of the cost of the nondomestic components of a product shall include:

    (i) The price paid to the nondomestic source;

    (ii) The cost of shipment to the port of entry into the United States;

    (iii) Applicable tariffs or duties;

    (iv) The cost of transportation from the port of entry to the distributor's plant or warehouse; and

    (v) Profit, overhead, and commissions of domestic and nondomestic suppliers and subcontractors of the components.

    (2) The following items shall not be considered in determining the cost of components, although they are proper elements in the determination of the final selling price of the product:

    (i) Fabrication or processing costs, if any, of nondomestic or domestic components at the assembly plant, or any other place of fabrication in the United States or any eligible country;

    (ii) Testing costs at the assembly plant or at the installation site;

    (iii) Direct profit, overhead, and commissions of the domestic distributor; and

    (iv) Cost of transportation from the domestic assembly point to the installation site.

    § 1787.7   Components.

#### § § 1787.7

    Where a component is manufactured only determines whether the component is classified as domestic or nondomestic even if all the materials and subcomponents comprising the component are manufactured in ineligible countries. A component manufactured in the United States or in an eligible country shall be considered domestic when determining whether a product is classified as domestic or nondomestic. A component manufactured in an ineligible country shall be considered nondomestic.

    § 1787.8   Purchase of nondomestic products.

#### § § 1787.8

    An RUS Borrower may only use loan funds to purchase a nondomestic product if a waiver pursuant to § 1787.10 has been received by the Administrator before entering into a contract with the vendor. Should the Administrator deny the waiver request, the RUS Borrower must use its own funds for the expenditure.

    § 1787.9   Waivers.

#### § § 1787.9

    Under limited circumstances the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement with respect to a specific contract entered into between an RUS Borrower and a third party which will be paid for with loan funds, subject to §§ 1787.10 through 1787.14.

    § 1787.10   Applications for specific waivers.

#### § § 1787.10

    RUS borrowers may request a specific waiver of the Buy American requirement through a written, detailed explanation showing that:

    (a) The cost between the nondomestic product and domestic product is unreasonable;

    (b) There is a non-availability of domestic products; or

    (c) It is not in the public interest or impractical for the RUS Borrower to purchase a domestic product.

    § 1787.11   Cost differential.

#### § § 1787.11

    By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement if the cost of the domestic product is unreasonable. Given that RUS loans terms normally range from 20 to 35 years, and that additional costs will be magnified with interest over these terms, the Administrator has determined that if the lowest bid or offered price is a nondomestic bid that is at least 6percent lower than the next lowest bid or offered price, the RUS Borrower may request a cost differential waiver. With respect to contracts that are not required to be bid, prices of market-available, domestic products must be used for comparison in a request for waiver.

    § 1787.12   Non-availability or shortages.

#### § § 1787.12

    By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement upon a showing that there is no domestic product available in the market in sufficient and reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality, and that such shortage of suitable domestic alternatives jeopardizes the project being completed on budget and/or according to scheduled planning. A lack of responsive and responsible bids to a well-publicized request for bids will be presumed to meet the conditions of a non-availability waiver. With respect to contracts that are not required to be bid, sufficient evidence must be presented to the Administrator in order to make a determination.

    § 1787.13   Public interest or impracticality.

#### § § 1787.13

    (a) By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement upon a showing that application of the requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest or impractical for the RUS Borrower. With respect to impracticality, an RUS Borrower may request a waiver upon a showing that the domestic product is incompatible or impractical to integrate with existing, significant capital infrastructure or existing, critical software already in use. Notwithstanding, the burden shall rest with the RUS Borrower to present how the use of the domestic product would create a hardship or negatively impact its project.

    (b) With respect to contracts that were approved by RUS based on a bidder or offer that originally certified compliance with the Buy America requirements, but which can no longer comply with such certification, the Administrator may grant an impracticality waiver based on a showing that the original certification was made in good faith and that the product cannot now be obtained domestically due to commercial impossibility or impracticability, or without undue hardship or a negative impact to the project.

    (c) In determining whether to issue any public interest waiver, the Administrator will consider all appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis, unless a general waiver has already been issued by the Administrator with respect to the product.

    § 1787.14   General waivers.

#### § § 1787.14

    (a) The Administrator may issue a general waiver for all RUS Borrowers for a determinate period, if the Administrator finds that such manufactured or unmanufactured goods are in shortage regionally or nationally, so as to avoid the administrative burden of issuing individual, specific waivers.

    (b) The Administrator has determined that it is in the best interest of RUS to issue a permanent general public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements for “small purchases,” which shall be published in the  for each program under the RE Act and amended as needed from time to time. In carrying out this exception, however, the Administrator shall ensure that contracts are not artificially fragmented.

    Subpart A—Borrower Insurance Requirements

      § 1788.1   General and definitions.

#### § § 1788.1

      (a) The standard forms of documents covering loans made or guaranteed by the Rural Utilities Service contain provisions regarding insurance and fidelity coverage to be maintained by each borrower. This part implements those provisions by setting forth the requirements to be met by all borrowers.

      (b) As used in this part:

      means any entity with any outstanding loan made or guaranteed by RUS.

      has the meaning found in § 1773.2.

      means the loan agreement, notes, and mortgage evidencing or used in conjunction with an RUS loan.

      means the mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement, or other security document securing an RUS loan.

      means any property subject to the lien of a mortgage.

      (c) RUS may revise these requirements on a case by case basis for borrowers with unusual circumstances.

      § 1788.2   General insurance requirements.

#### § § 1788.2

      (a) Borrowers will take out, as the respective risks are incurred, and maintain the classes and amounts of insurance in conformance with generally accepted utility industry standards for such classes and amounts of coverage for utilities of the size and character of the borrower and consistent with Prudent Utility Practice. Prudent Utility Practice shall mean any of the practices, methods, and acts which, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, in light of the facts, including but not limited to, the practices, methods, and acts engaged in or approved by a significant portion of the electric utility industry in the case of an electric borrower or of the telecommunications industry in the case of a telecommunications borrowers prior thereto, known at the time the decision was made, would have been expected to accomplish the desired result consistent with cost-effectiveness, reliability, safety, and expedition. It is recognized that Prudent Utility Practice is not intended to be limited to optimum practice, method, or act to the exclusion of all others, but rather is a spectrum of possible practices, methods, or act which could have been expected to accomplish the desired result at the lowest reasonable cost consistent with cost-effectiveness, reliability, safety, and expedition.

      (b) The foregoing insurance coverage shall be obtained by means of bond and policy forms approved by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, and, with respect to insurance upon any part of the mortgaged property securing an RUS loan, shall provide that the insurance shall be payable to the mortgagees as their interests may appear by means of the standard mortgagee clause without contribution. Each policy or other contract for such insurance shall contain an agreement by the insurer that, notwithstanding any right of cancellation reserved to such insurer, such policy or contract shall continue in force for at least 30 days after written notice to each mortgagee of suspension, cancellation, or termination.

      (c) In the event of damage to or the destruction or loss of any portion of the mortgaged property which is used or useful in the borrower's business and which shall be covered by insurance, unless each mortgagee shall otherwise agree, the borrower shall replace or restore such damaged, destroyed, or lost portion so that such mortgaged property shall be in substantially the same condition as it was in prior to such damage, destruction, or loss and shall apply the proceeds of the insurance for that purpose. The borrower shall replace the lost portion of such mortgaged property or shall commence such restoration promptly after such damage, destruction, or loss shall have occurred and shall complete such replacement or restoration as expeditiously as practicable, and shall pay or cause to be paid out of the proceeds of such insurance form all costs and expenses in connection therewith.

      (d) Sums recovered under any policy or fidelity bond by the borrower for a loss of funds advanced under a note secured by a mortgage or recovered by any mortgagee or holder of any note secured by the mortgage for any loss under such policy or bond shall, unless applied as provided in the preceding paragraph, be used as directed by the borrower's mortgage.

      (e) Borrowers shall furnish evidence annually that the required insurance and fidelity coverage has been in force for the entire year, and that the borrower has taken all steps currently necessary and will continue to take all steps necessary to ensure that the coverage will remain in force until all loans made or guaranteed by RUS are paid in full. Such evidence shall be in a form satisfactory to RUS. Generally a certification included as part of the RUS Financial and Statistical Report filed by the borrower annually (RUS Form 7 or Form 12 for electric borrowers, RUS Form 479 for telecommunications borrowers, or the successors to these forms) is sufficient evidence of this coverage.

      § 1788.3   Flood insurance.

#### § § 1788.3

      (a) Borrowers shall purchase and maintain flood insurance for buildings in flood hazard areas to the extent available and required under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, ) The insurance should cover, in addition to the building, any machinery, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings contained in the building.

      (b) The National Flood Insurance Program (see 44 CFR part 59 ) provides for a standard flood insurance policy; however, other existing insurance policies which provide flood coverage may be used where flood insurance is available in lieu of the standard flood insurance policy. Such policies must be endorsed to provide:

      (1) That the insurer give 30 days written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to the insured with respect to the flood insurance coverage. To be effective, such notice must be mailed to both the insured and RUS and other mortgagees if any and must include information as to the availability of flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program, and

      (2) That the flood insurance coverage is at least as broad as the coverage offered by the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

      § 1788.4   Disclosure of irregularities and illegal acts.

#### § § 1788.4

      (a) Borrowers must immediately report, in writing, all irregularities and all indications or instances of illegal acts in its operations, whether material or not, to RUS and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See 7 CFR 1773.9(c)(3) for OIG addresses. The reporting requirements for borrowers are the same as those for CPA's set forth in § 1773.9

      (b) Borrowers are required to make full disclosure to the bonding company of the dishonest or fraudulent acts.

      § 1788.5   RUS endorsement required.

#### § § 1788.5

      § 1788.6   RUS right to place insurance.

#### § § 1788.6

      If a borrower fails to purchase or maintain the required insurance and fidelity coverage, the mortgagees may place required insurance and fidelity coverage on behalf and in the name of the borrower. The borrower shall pay the cost of this coverage, as provided in the loan documents.

      (b) Electric borrowers shall also ensure that all architects and engineers working under contract with the borrower have insurance coverage for Errors and Omissions (Professional Liability Insurance) in an amount at least as large as the amount of the architectural or engineering services contract but not less than $500,000.

      (c) The borrower may increase the limits of insurance if desired.

      (d) The minimum requirement of $1 million of public liability insurance does not apply to contractors performing maintenance work, janitorial-type services, meter reading services, rights-of-way mowing, and jobs of a similar nature. However, borrowers shall ensure that the contractor performing the work has public liability coverage at a level determined to be appropriate by the borrower.

      (e) If requested by RUS, the borrower shall provide RUS with a certificate from the contractor, engineer, or architect evidencing compliance with the requirements of this section.

#### § § 1789.152

      (a) As provided in this subpart, RUS may, at its discretion, use the services of Consultants funded by a Borrower where such services will facilitate timely action on an Application by such Borrower for financial assistance or other approvals. Such Consultants may provide financial, legal, engineering, environmental or other technical advice and services in connection with the review of an Application.

      (b) With the approval of RUS, a Borrower may fund the cost of consulting services in connection with the review by RUS of an Application by such Borrower. Such funding shall be provided pursuant to the terms of a Funding Agreement between the Borrower and the Consultant designated by RUS.

      (c) RUS may not, without the consent of the Borrower, require, as a condition of processing any Application for approval, that the Borrower agree to pay the costs of a Consultant hired to provide services to RUS.

      (d) The government shall retain sole discretion in the selection of Consultants to provide services to RUS and the form of contract utilized. RUS may either use the services of one or more Consultants retained under Retainer Contracts or the government may elect to retain a Consultant not otherwise on retainer. The government shall have sole discretion to prescribe terms and conditions of Consultant Contracts. The Borrower may bring considerations to the attention of the government which the Borrower deems pertinent to the selection process.

      (e) RUS shall retain sole discretion as to whether to further pursue use of an outside consultant for the relevant application in the event the Borrower does not enter into the agreements referenced in § 1789.158(c)(3)(iii) within 60 days of the government providing to the Borrower the information set forth in § 1789.158(c)(3).

      § 1789.153   Borrower funding.

#### § § 1789.153

      Borrowers shall use their general funds for the purposes of funding consultant services hereunder. Borrowers may not use the proceeds of loans made or guaranteed under the RE Act for costs incurred by Borrowers pursuant to the funding of consultant services for RUS.

      § 1789.154   Eligible borrowers.

#### § § 1789.154

      All Borrowers are eligible to fund consultant services under this part.

      § 1789.155   Approval criteria.

#### § § 1789.155

      RUS will consider approving the use of consultant services funded by a Borrower on a case by case basis taking into account, among other matters, the following:

      (a) Whether such services are required to facilitate timely action on a Borrower's Application. RUS shall determine what represents timely action with respect to each Application considering, among other matters, the review period normally required for such projects by RUS and other lenders and the consequences to the Borrower of adjusting the review period.

      (b) The availability of staff resources, the priorities of other projects then before RUS, and the efficiencies to be realized from the use of consultant services.

      (c) Whether it is in the best interest of RUS to use Borrower-funded Consultants. Certain types of projects, such as those involving issues of program-wide significance, may not be well suited for the use of Borrower funded Consultants.

      § 1789.156   Proposal procedure.

#### § § 1789.156

      (a) In the event RUS determines that consideration should be given to the use of a Borrower-funded consultant in connection with the review of an Application, the RUS Regional Director or the Director of the Power Supply Division, as appropriate, will discuss with the Borrower the nature of the Application and the projected review period required of RUS. If RUS concludes that the projected review period will not result in timely action on the Application, and after being so notified in writing by RUS the Borrower wishes to fund consultant services to facilitate RUS review, the Borrower shall submit to the same Director a funding proposal. The proposal shall set forth the following:

      (1) Identification in the heading or caption as a Notice of Proposal to Fund Consulting Services;

      (2) Borrower's REA/RUS designation;

      (3) Borrower's legal name and address;

      (4) A description of the Application, critical issues and concerns relating to the Application, time deadlines, and the consequences of any delays in RUS review;

      (5) A description of the consulting service(s) that would facilitate timely RUS review of the Application; and

      (6) Such additional documents and information as RUS may request.

      (b) RUS will review the Notice of Proposal to Fund and any additional information RUS deems relevant in determining whether to proceed with procuring Borrower funded Consultants. If RUS proposes to utilize Legal Consultants, RUS must obtain the concurrence of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the Department of Agriculture. RUS will notify the Borrower in writing of its determination.

      § 1789.157   Consultant contract.

#### § § 1789.157

      (a) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR Ch. 1, and the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation (AGAR), 48 CFR Ch. 4, shall apply to all Consultant Contracts entered into pursuant to this part except as provided in this section.

      (1) Contracts for Legal Consultants shall provide for a technical representative from OGC.

      (2) All Consultant Contracts shall provide for an escrow account funding mechanism pursuant to this part and for the government's sole discretion in determining whether payments are to be made from the Escrow Account to the Consultant.

      (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall be given prominent emphasis in requests for proposals issued under this part.

      § 1789.158   Implementation.

#### § § 1789.158

      (a) Upon making a determination to go forward with Borrower funding for consulting services, RUS shall initiate a procurement request for a Consultant to provide the services. The government may either contract with a Consultant on a case by case basis or elect to use a Consultant pursuant to an outstanding Retainer Contract. The Borrower will not be informed of the Consultant selected until such time as the government provides the information set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

      (b) If the government determines to contract with a Consultant on a case by case basis, the government shall notify the Borrower of the applicable procedures.

      (c) If the government determines to contract with a Consultant under an outstanding Retainer Contract, the following procedures will normally apply:

      (1) Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the government will prepare a draft Task Order requesting consultant services in connection with the review of the Borrower's Application. The draft Task Order shall set forth for the Consultant's review and acceptance, a description of the services to be provided and applicable time frames for the provision of such services.

      (2) The government will request that the Consultant:

      (i) Notify the government as to the acceptability of the form and substance of the draft Task Order;

      (ii) Notify the government as to its ability to provide a satisfactory conflict of interest certification consistent with the requirements of the FAR (48 CFR ch. 1); and

      (iii) Provide a cost estimate for the draft Task Order.

      (3) When the government is satisfied with the response(s) received pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the government shall promptly provide to the Borrower:

      (i) A copy of the draft Task Order identifying the Consultant;

      (ii) The Consultant's cost estimate for the draft Task Order; and

      (iii) Contract information required to enable the Borrower to develop a Funding Agreement, an Escrow Agreement and an Indemnification Agreement (the “agreements”).

      (4) The Borrower shall develop and submit to the government for approval executed originals of:

      (i) The agreements; and

      (ii) A certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors authorizing the Borrower to enter into the agreements and to take such other action as is necessary to effect the purposes of the agreements.

      (5) Upon receiving written RUS approval of the agreements and the form and substance of the board resolution, the Borrower shall:

      (i) Establish and fund the Escrow Account; and

      (ii) Provide written notice to the government of the Escrow Account number, the funding thereof, and such other information as required pursuant to the agreements.

      (6) After the Borrower has funded the Escrow Account, the government shall issue Task Order(s) for consultant services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Retainer Contract.

      § 1789.159   Contract administration.

#### § § 1789.159

      The government shall be solely responsible for the administration of a Consulting Contract and shall have complete control over the scope of the Consultant's work, the timetable for performance, the standards to be applied in determining the acceptability of deliverables and the approval of payment of Invoices.

      § 1789.160   Access to information.

#### § § 1789.160

      The Borrower shall not have rights in nor right of access to the work product of the Consultant. All analyses, studies, opinions, memoranda, and other documents and information provided by the Consultant pursuant to a Consulting Contract may be released and made available to the Borrower only with the approval of RUS. This section does not restrict release of information by RUS pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)) or other legal process.

      § 1789.161   Conflicts of interest.

#### § § 1789.161

      The standard for determining organizational conflicts of interest shall be as set forth in the FAR subpart 9.5 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.5); however, the identification of the existence of an organizational conflict of interest may be made by either the Administrator or the cognizant Contracting Officer. In the event an organizational conflict of interest is determined to exist, the cognizant Contracting Officer shall take the actions prescribed at FAR 9.504 (48 CFR 9.504) to attempt to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the conflict. Should these actions be deemed by the Administrator and the Contracting Officer to adequately resolve the conflict, the contracting action with the offeror/contractor may proceed. Should the Administrator or the Contracting Officer determine that an organizational conflict of interest still exists such that contract award or other contracting action cannot be taken (award of task/delivery order, etc.) the offeror/contractor shall be so informed by the Contracting Officer and be provided a reasonable opportunity to respond in accordance with FAR 9.504(e) (48 CFR 9.504(e)). After considering the contractor's response, if it is found by both the Administrator and Contracting Officer to remedy the conflict of interest, the contracting action may proceed. If the Administrator and Contracting Officer determine that the contractor's response does not resolve the conflict of interest, yet continuing with the contracting action with the offeror/contractor in question is considered in the best interest of the United States, a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 (48 CFR 9.503) may be executed. This waiver shall be submitted under the Contracting Officer's signature and approved by the Administrator. The Administrator has been delegated Head of Contracting Activity authority by the USDA Senior Procurement Executive solely for the purpose of waiver approval.

      § 1789.162   Indemnification agreement.

#### § § 1789.162

      As a condition of approving Borrower funding, the government will require the Borrower to enter into an Indemnification Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, providing that the Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the government and any officers, agents or employees of the government from any and all liability, including costs, fees, and settlements arising out of, or in any way connected with the payment of the Consultant's fee pursuant to the Consultant Contract. The Indemnification Agreement may recognize, as a condition of liability thereunder, the rights of the borrower to prompt notice, to use of counsel of its own choosing, and to participation in any settlement of a claim against which indemnification is sought.

      § 1789.163   Waiver.

#### § § 1789.163

      RUS may waive any requirement or procedure of this subpart by determining that its application in a particular situation would not be in the government's interest, except that certain provision that the subject contracts are subject to the provisions of the FAR (48 CFR ch. 1) and AGAR (48 CFR ch. 4).
