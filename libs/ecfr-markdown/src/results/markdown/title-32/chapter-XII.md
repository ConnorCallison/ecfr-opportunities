      § 1290.8   Procedures.

#### § § 1290.8

      (a)  with:

      (1) The means to process and dispose of certain categories of minor offenses by mail. Under this system, U.S. Magistrate and District Courts will, by local court rule, preset fines for the bulk of petty violations (Federal or Assimilated) and permit persons charged with such violations, who do not contest the charge nor wish to have a court hearing, to pay their fines by using mail-in, preaddressed, postage paid envelopes furnished to them with the violation notice.

      (2) Efficient, minimal commitment of judicial and clerical time by using uniform procedures which centralize the collection of fines, the scheduling of mandatory hearings or hearings where violators request them, and the keeping of violator records.

      (3) A simple but sure method of accounting for fines collected and tickets issued.

      (4) Impartial enforcement of minor offense laws.

      (b) —(1)  (i) As required by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, each District Court will determine, by local court rule, those offenses requiring mandatory appearance of violators.

      (B) Offenses resulting in accidents.

      (C) Operation of motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or a narcotic or habit producing or other mind altering drug, or permitting another person who is under the influence of intoxicating alcohol, or a narcotic or habit producing or mind altering drug to operate a motor vehicle owned by the defendant or in his/her custody or control.

      (D) Reckless driving or speeding.

      (2) Voluntary Appearances—(i)  (A) Personnel issuing DD Form 1805 will refer violator for hearings before U.S. Magistrates in each instance where a hearing is requested by the violator.

      (B) Command security officers will provide security force personnel with necessary information to facilitate scheduling violators to appear before U.S. Magistrates. Box B of the DD Form 1805 will be marked by the issuing official for each violator requesting a hearing. Additionally procedures set forth in appendix A will be accomplished by the official issuing violation notice.

      (ii)  (A) Voluntary appearance procedures are also available for violators who are not present at the time a DD Form 1805 is issued (i.e., parking violations) or who subsequently decide to voluntarily appear before a U.S. Magistrate rather than pay the fine indicated in the DD Form 1805.

      (B) Violators who use the mail-in procedure to voluntarily appear before a U.S. Magistrate must follow the instructions in Box B of the DD Form 1805 (violator copy). The violator will be notified by the clerk of the District Court of the time and place to appear for the scheduled hearing.

      § 1290.9   Forms and reports.

#### § § 1290.9

      (a)  (1) The U.S. Magistrate system is based on use of a four-ply ticket designed to provide legal notice to violators and records required by the court, law enforcement authorities, and, if appropriate, the state motor vehicle departments. The DD Form 1805 is printed on chemically carbonized paper and prenumbered in series for accounting control. Heads of DLA primary level field activities are responsible for maintaining accountability for each ticket issued and stocks on hand.

      (2) DLA field activity Counsels will coordinate with the U.S. Magistrate of the judicial district in which the activity is located and maintain the information listed below:

      (i) List of petty offenses for which mail-in procedure is authorized and the amount of the fine for each specific offense. The District Court address will be prestamped on the violator's copy of the DD Form 1805 by the applicable issuing authority.

      (ii) List of minor offenses requiring mandatory appearance of the violator before the magistrate. The name and location of the magistrate before whom violators will appear. Schedule will be coordinated with nearest Military Service activity and appearance will be conducted jointly whenever possible.

      (b)  (1) Information entered on the DD Form 1805 is dependent upon two considerations:

      (i) The type of violation, i.e., parking, (such as blocking a fire lane) moving traffic violation, or nontraffic offenses.

      (ii) Whether the offense cited requires the mandatory appearance of the violator before a U.S. Magistrate.

      (2) Preparation and disposition of DD Form 1805:

      (i) See illustration in appendix B for petty offenses where the mail-in fine procedures are authorized.

      (A) The amount of the fine for a specific offense must be recorded in the lower right corner of the DD Form 1805. This amount will always be predetermined by the U.S. Magistrate and provided to on duty enforcement personnel by the activity security officer or equivalent authority. When violation notices are issued for an offense (e.g., parking violation) and the offender is absent, all entries concerning the violator will be left blank.

      (B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:

      () The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator or placed on the vehicle of the violator.

      () Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security Officer will forward copies one and two, by letter of transmittal, to the appropriate U.S. District Court.

      () Copy three will be filed at the Security Office or equivalent issuing authority. DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record, will be annotated with each traffic offense.

      (ii) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mail-in type violations, the appropriate supervisor will be provided an information copy of DLA Form 635, Security/Criminal Incident Report, denoting the date, time, place, and type of violation, and the amount of fine assessed.

      (iii) Heads of DLA primary level field activities or their representative will not accept or otherwise collect any fines or keep records of fines paid or not paid. They also will take no action concerning nonpayment delinquencies except where warrants are subsequently issued for the violator concerned by the appropriate court authorities.

      (iv) See illustrations in appendices C and D for minor offenses requiring the mandatory appearance of violators before the U.S. Magistrate:

      (A) Mail-in fine procedures will not apply in mandatory appearance cases. The law enforcement authority issuing a violation notice for an offense requiring mandatory appearance of the violator, will place a check mark in “Box A”, DD Form 1805. The name and location of the U.S. Magistrate before whom the violator must appear will be inserted on the line below “United States District Court” as shown in appendix C. The date and time of the initial appearance will be entered in the space provided in “Box A”. It is the violator's responsibility to verify the date, time, and place of required court appearances.

      (B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:

      () The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator.

      () Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security Officer will forward copies one and two, by transmittal as soon as possible, to the magistrate before whom the violator is scheduled to appear.

      () Copy three will be filed in the office of the Security Officer or equivalent issuing authority.

      (C) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mandatory appearance type offenses, the individual's supervisor will be provided an information copy of DLA Form 635, denoting the date, time, place, and type of violation, and the date the violator is scheduled to appear before the U.S. Magistrate.

      (v) Additional information governing preparation of DD Form 1805 is provided as appendix A.
