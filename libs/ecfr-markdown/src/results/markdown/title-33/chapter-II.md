    Subpart A—Introduction

      § 203.11   Purpose.

#### § § 203.11

      This part prescribes administrative policies, guidance, and operating procedures for natural disaster preparedness, response, and recovery activities of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

      § 203.12   Authority.

#### § § 203.12

      Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 701n) (69 Stat. 186), commonly and hereinafter referred to as Public Law 84-99, authorizes an emergency fund to be expended at the discretion of the Chief of Engineers for: preparation for natural disasters; flood fighting and rescue operations; repair or restoration of flood control works threatened, damaged, or destroyed by flood, or nonstructural alternatives thereto; emergency protection of federally authorized hurricane or shore protection projects which are threatened, when such protection is warranted to protect against imminent and substantial loss to life and property; and repair and restoration of federally authorized hurricane or shore protection projects damaged or destroyed by wind, wave, or water of other than ordinary nature. The law includes provision of emergency supplies of clean water when a contaminated source threatens the public health and welfare of a locality, and activities necessary to protect life and improved property from a threat resulting from a major flood or coastal storm. This law authorizes the Secretary of the Army (Secretary) to construct wells and to transport water within areas determined by the Secretary to be drought-distressed. The Secretary of the Army has delegated the authority vested in the Secretary under Public Law 84-99 through the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) to the Chief of Engineers, subject to such further direction as the Secretary may provide.

      § 203.13   Available assistance.

#### § § 203.13

      Corps assistance provided under authority of Public Law 84-99 is intended to be supplemental to State and local efforts. The principal assistance programs and activities of the Corps are described in this section.

      (a)  Technical assistance for many types of disasters is available to State and local interests. Primary Corps efforts are focused on technical assistance for, and inspections of, flood control works, and related flood fight preparedness and training activities. Technical assistance for specialized studies, project development, and related activities, and requirements for long term assistance, are normally beyond the scope of disaster preparedness assistance, and are appropriately addressed by other Corps authorities and programs. Subpart B addresses disaster preparedness responsibilities and activities.

      (b)  Emergency operations, consisting of Flood Response (flood fight and rescue operations) and Post Flood Response assistance, may be provided to supplement State and local emergency operations efforts. Subpart C of this part addresses emergency operations assistance.

      (c)  The Corps may rehabilitate flood control works damaged or destroyed by floods and coastal storms. The Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) incorporates both disaster preparedness activities and Rehabilitation Assistance. The RIP consists of a process to inspect flood control works; a status determination,  an inspection-based determination of qualification for future potential Rehabilitation Assistance; and the provision of Rehabilitation Assistance to those projects with Active status that are damaged in a flood or coastal storm event. Subpart D addresses Rehabilitation Assistance and the RIP.

      (d)  The Corps may provide emergency supplies of clean water to any locality confronted with a source of contaminated water causing, or likely to cause, a substantial threat to the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the locality. Subpart E addresses emergency water supply assistance.

      (e)  Corps assistance may be provided to drought-distressed areas (as declared by the Secretary of the Army or his delegated nominee) to construct wells and to transport water for human consumption. Subpart E addresses drought assistance.

      (f)  Advance Measures assistance may be provided to protect against imminent threats of predicted, but unusual, floods. Advance Measures projects must be justified from an engineering and economic standpoint, and must be capable of completion in a timely manner. Advance Measures assistance may be provided only to protect against loss of life and/or significant damages to improved property due to flooding. Subpart F of this part addresses Advance Measures assistance.

      § 203.14   Responsibilities of non-Federal interests.

#### § § 203.14

      Non-Federal interests, which include State, county and local governments; federally recognized Indian Tribes; and Alaska Native Corporations, are required to make full use of their own resources before Federal assistance can be furnished. The National Guard, as part of the State's resources when it is under State control, must be fully utilized as part of the non-Federal response. Non-Federal responsibilities include the following:

      (a)  Disaster preparedness is a basic tenet of State and local responsibility. Disaster preparedness responsibilities of non-Federal interests include:

      (1) Operation and maintenance of flood control works;

      (2) Procurement and stockpiling of sandbags, pumps, and/or other materials or equipment that might be needed during flood situations;

      (3) Training personnel to operate, maintain, and patrol projects during crisis situations, and preparation of plans to address emergency situations;

      (4) Taking those actions necessary for flood control works to gain and maintain an Active status in the Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), as detailed in subpart D of this part; and,

      (5) Responsible regulation, management, and use of floodplain areas.

      (b)  During emergency operations, non-Federal interests must commit available resources, to include work force, supplies, equipment, and funds. Requests for Corps emergency operations assistance will be in writing from the appropriate State, tribal, or local official. For flood fight direct assistance and Post Flood Response assistance, non-Federal interests must furnish formal written assurances of local cooperation by entering into Cooperation Agreements (CA's), as detailed in subpart G of this regulation. (For Corps work authorized under Public Law 84-99, the term “Cooperation Agreement” is used to differentiate this agreement from a Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) that addresses the original construction of a project.) Following Flood Response or Post Flood Response assistance, it is a non-Federal responsibility to remove expedient flood control structures and similar works installed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99.

      (c)  Prior to Corps rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects, non-Federal interests must furnish formal written assurances of local cooperation by entering into a CA, as detailed in subpart G of this part. Requirements of local participation include such items as provision of lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and suitable borrow and dredged or excavated material disposal areas (LERRD's), applicable cost-sharing, and costs attributable to deficient and/or deferred maintenance.

      (d)  Sponsors of Federal flood control projects are usually not required to furnish written assurances of local cooperation, if the PCA for the original construction of the project is sufficient. ( The PCA may also be referred to as a local cooperation agreement (LCA), cooperation and participation agreement (C&P), or similar terms.) In lieu of a new PCA, the Corps will notify the sponsor of the sponsor's standing requirements, including such items as LERRD's, costs attributable to deficient or deferred maintenance, removal of temporary works, relocations, and any cost-sharing requirements contained in subpart G of § 203.82. Modifications to the existing Operation and Maintenance Manual may be required based on the Rehabilitation Assistance required.

      (e)  Except for federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations, Non-Federal interests must first seek emergency water assistance through the Governor of the affected State. If the State is unable to provide the needed assistance, then the Governor or his or her authorized representative must request Corps assistance in writing. Similarly, requests for Corps assistance for Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations must be submitted in writing. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Requests for assistance must include information concerning the criteria prescribed by subpart E of this part.

      (f)  Except for federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations, non-Federal interests must first seek emergency drinking water assistance through the Governor of the affected State. Requests for Corps assistance will be in writing from the Governor or his or her authorized representative. Similarly, requests for Corps assistance for Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations must be submitted in writing. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Assistance can be provided to those drought-distressed areas (as declared by the Secretary of the Army) to construct wells and to transport water for human consumption. Requests for assistance must include information concerning the criteria prescribed by subpart E of this part.

      (g)  Advance Measures assistance should complement the maximum non-Federal capability. Requests for assistance must be made by the Governor of the affected State, except requests for assistance on tribal lands held in trust by the United States, or on lands of the Alaska Natives, may be submitted directly by the affected Federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation, or through the regional representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or through the Governor of the State in which the lands are located. A CA (see subpart G of this part) is required prior to assistance being rendered. Non-Federal participation may include either financial contribution or commitment of non-Federal physical resources, or both.

      § 203.15   Definitions.

#### § § 203.15

      The following definitions are applicable throughout this part:

      A project constructed by the Corps, and subsequently turned over to a local sponsor for operations and maintenance responsibility. This definition also includes any project specifically designated as a Federal project by an Act of Congress.

      A project designed and constructed to have appreciable and dependable effects in preventing damage from irregular and unusual rises in water level. For a multipurpose project, only those components that are necessary for the flood control function are considered eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.

      All references in part 203 to the Governor of a State also refer to: the Governors of United States commonwealths, territories, and possessions; and the Mayor of Washington, D.C.

      A flood control project designed and constructed to have appreciable and predictable effects in preventing damage to developed areas from the impacts of hurricanes, tsunamis, and coastal storms. These effects are primarily to protect against wave action, storm surge, wind, and the complicating factors of extraordinary high tides. HSPP's include projects known as shore protection projects, shore protection structures, periodic nourishment projects, shore enhancement projects, and similar terms. Components of an HSPP may include both hard (permanent construction) and soft (sacrificial,  sand) features.

      A project constructed with non-Federal funds, or a project constructed by tribal, State, local, or private interests, or a component of such a project. A project constructed under Federal emergency disaster authorities, such as Public Law 84-99 or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, ) (hereinafter referred to as the Stafford Act), is a non-Federal project unless it repairs or replaces an existing Federal project. Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects, and projects funded completely or partially by other (non-Corps) Federal agencies, are considered non-Federal projects for the application of Public Law 84-99 authority.

      A non-Federal sponsor is a public entity that is a legally constituted public body with full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement as the non-Federal partner of the Corps for a project, and able to pay damages, if necessary, in the event of its failure to perform. A non-Federal sponsor may be a State, County, City, Town, Federally recognized Indian Tribe or tribal organization, Alaska Native Corporation, or any political subpart of a State or group of states that has the legal and financial authority and capability to provide the necessary cash contributions and LERRD's necessary for the project.

      The term “repair and rehabilitation” means the repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure, after the structure has been damaged by a flood, hurricane, or coastal storm, to the level of protection provided by the structure prior to the flood, hurricane, or coastal storm. “Repair and rehabilitation” does not include improvements (betterments) to the structure, nor does “repair and rehabilitation” include any repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure that, in the normal course of usage, has become structurally unsound and is no longer fit to provide the level of protection for which it was designed.

      § 203.16   Federally recognized Indian Tribes and the Alaska Native Corporations.

#### § § 203.16

      Requests for Public Law 84-99 assistance on tribal lands held in trust by the United States, or on lands of the Alaska Natives, may be submitted to the Corps directly by the affected federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation, or through the appropriate regional representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or through the Governor of the State.

    Subpart B—Disaster Preparedness

      § 203.21   Disaster preparedness responsibilities of non-Federal interests.

#### § § 203.21

      Disaster preparedness is a basic tenet of State and local responsibility. Assistance provided under authority of Public Law 84-99 is intended to be supplemental to the maximum efforts of State and local interests. Assistance under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided when non-Federal interests have made insufficient efforts to address the situation for which assistance is requested. Assistance under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided when a request for such assistance is based entirely on a lack of fiscal resources with which to address the situation. Non-Federal interests' responsibilities are addressed in detail as follows:

      (a)  Flood control works must be operated and maintained by non-Federal interests. Maintenance includes both short-term activities (normally done on an annual cycle, or more frequently) such as vegetation control and control of burrowing animals, and longer term activities such as repair or replacement of structural components (e.g., culverts) of the project.

      (b)  Procurement and stockpiling of sandbags, pumps, and/or other materials or equipment that might be needed during flood situations is a non-Federal responsibility. The Corps is normally a last resort option for obtaining such materials. Local interests should request such materials from State assets prior to seeking Corps assistance. Local interests are responsible for reimbursing (either in kind or in cash) the Corps for expendable flood fight supplies and materials, and returning items such as pumps. When a flood is of sufficient magnitude to receive a Stafford Act emergency or disaster declaration, then the District Engineer may waive reimbursement of expendable supplies.

      (c)  Training personnel to operate, maintain, and patrol flood control projects during crisis situations is a non-Federal responsibility. Specific plans should be developed and in place to address known problem areas. For instance, the non-Federal sponsor of a levee reach prone to boils should have personnel specifically trained in flood fighting boils. In addition, contingency plans must be made when needed to address short term situations. For instance, if a culvert through a levee is being replaced, then the contingency plan should address all actions needed should a flood event occur during the construction period when levee integrity is lacking.

      (d)  To be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance under Public Law 84-99, it is a non-Federal responsibility to take those actions necessary for flood control works to gain and maintain an Active status in the Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), as detailed in subpart D of this part.

    Subpart C—Emergency Operations

      § 203.31   Authority.

#### § § 203.31

      Emergency operations under Public Law 84-99 apply to Flood Response and Post Flood Response activities. Flood Response activities include flood fighting, rescue operations, and protection of Corps-constructed hurricane/shore protection projects. Post Flood Response activities include certain limited activities intended to prevent imminent loss of life or significant public property, or to protect against significant threats to public health and welfare, and are intended to bridge the time frame between the occurrence of a disaster and the provision of disaster relief efforts under authority of The Stafford Act.

      (a)  Flood Response measures are applicable to any flood control work where assistance is supplemental to tribal, State, and local efforts, except that Corps assistance is not appropriate to protect flood control works constructed, previously repaired, and/or maintained by other Federal agencies, where such agencies have emergency flood fighting authority. Further, Flood Response measures (except technical assistance) are not appropriate for flood control works protecting strictly agricultural lands. Corps assistance in support of other Federal agencies, or State and local interests, may include the following: technical advice and assistance; lending of flood fight supplies, e.g., sandbags, lumber, polyethylene sheeting, or stone; lending of Corps-owned equipment; hiring of equipment and operators for flood operations; emergency contracting; and similar measures.

      (b)  The Corps may furnish Post Flood Response assistance for a period not to exceed 10 days (the statutory limitation) from the date of the Governor's request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an emergency or disaster declaration under authority of the Stafford Act. Requests for Post Flood Response assistance must be made by the Governor of the affected State, except that requests for assistance on lands held in trust by the United States, or on lands of the Alaska Natives, may be submitted directly by the affected federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation, or through the appropriate regional representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or through the Governor of the State in which the lands are located. Assistance from the Corps may include the following: provision of technical advice and assistance; cleaning of drainage channels, bridge openings, or structures blocked by debris deposited during a flood event, where the immediate threat of flooding of or damage to public facilities has not abated; removal of debris blockages of critical water supply intakes, sewer outfalls, etc.; clearance of the minimum amounts of debris necessary to reopen critical transportation routes or public services/facilities; other assistance required to prevent imminent loss of life or significant damage to public property, or to protect against significant threats to public health and welfare. Post Flood Response assistance is supplemental to the maximum efforts of non-Federal interests.

      § 203.32   Policy.

#### § § 203.32

      Prior to, during, or immediately following flood or coastal storm activity, emergency operations may be undertaken to supplement State and local activities. Corps assistance is limited to the preservation of life and property,  residential/commercial/industrial developments, and public facilities/services. Direct assistance to individual homeowners, individual property owners, or businesses is not permitted. Assistance will be temporary to meet the immediate threat, and is not intended to provide permanent solutions. All Corps activities will be coordinated with the State Emergency Management Agency or equivalent. Reimbursement of State or local emergency costs is not authorized. The local assurances required for the provision of Corps assistance apply only to the work performed under Public Law 84-99, and will not prevent State or local governments from receiving other Federal assistance for which they are eligible.

      (a)  Requests for Corps assistance will be in writing from the appropriate requesting official, or his or her authorized representative. When time does not permit a written request, a verbal request from a responsible tribal, State, or local official will be accepted, followed by a written confirmation.

      (1) Corps assistance may include operational control of flood response activities, if requested by the responsible tribal, State, or local official. However, legal responsibility always remains with the tribal, State, and local officials.

      (2) Corps assistance will be terminated when the flood waters recede below bankfull, absent a short term threat (e.g., a significant storm front expected to arrive within a day or two) likely to cause additional flooding.

      (3) Removal of ice jams is a local responsibility. Corps technical advice and assistance, as well as assistance with flood fight operations, can be provided to supplement State and local efforts. The Corps will not perform ice jam blasting operations for local interests.

      (b)  A written request from the Governor is required to receive Corps assistance. Corps assistance will be limited to major floods or coastal storm disasters resulting in life threatening situations. The Governor's request will include verification that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been requested to make an emergency or disaster declaration; a statement that the assistance required is beyond the State's capability; specific damage locations; and the extent of Corps assistance required to supplement State and local efforts. Corps assistance is limited to 10 days following receipt of the Governor's written request, or on assumption of activities by State and local interests, whichever is earlier. After a Governor's request has triggered the 10-day period, subsequent request(s) for additional assistance resulting from the same flood or coastal storm event will not extend the 10-day period, or trigger a new 10-day period. The Corps will deny any Governor's request for Post Flood Response if it is received subsequent to a Stafford Act Presidential disaster declaration, or denial of such a declaration. Shoreline or beach erosion damage reduction/prevention actions under Post Flood Response will normally not be undertaken unless there is an immediate threat to life or critical public facilities.

      (c)  (1) Issuance of Government-owned equipment or materials to non-Federal interests is authorized only after local resources have been fully committed.

      (2) Equipment that is lent will be returned to the Corps immediately after the flood operation ceases, in a fully maintained condition, or with funds to pay for such maintenance. The Corps may waive the non-Federal interest's responsibility to pay for or perform maintenance if a Stafford Act Presidential emergency or disaster declaration has already been made for the affected locality, and the waiver is considered feasible and reasonable.

      (3) Expendable supplies that are lent, such as sandbags, will be replaced in kind, or paid for by local interests. The Corps may waive the local interest's replacement/payment if a Stafford Act Presidential disaster declaration has been made for the affected locality, and the waiver is considered feasible and reasonable. All unused expendable supplies will be returned to the Corps when the operation is terminated.

    Subpart D—Rehabilitation Assistance for Flood Control Works Damaged by Flood or Coastal Storm: The Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program

      § 203.41   General.

#### § § 203.41

      (a)  Public Law 84-99 authorizes repair and restoration of the following types of projects to ensure their continued function:

      (1) Flood control projects.

      (2) Federally authorized and constructed hurricane/shore protection projects.

      (b)  The Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) implements Public Law 84-99 authority to repair and rehabilitate flood control projects damaged by floods and coastal storm events. The RIP consists of a process to inspect flood control work; a status determination,  an inspection-based determination of qualification for future Rehabilitation Assistance; and the provision of Rehabilitation Assistance to those projects with Active status that are damaged in a flood or coastal storm event.

      (c)  In order for a flood control work to be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance, it must be in an Active status at the time of damage from a flood or coastal storm event. To gain an Active status, a non-Federal flood control work must meet certain engineering, maintenance, and qualification criteria, as determined by the Corps during an Initial Eligibility Inspection (IEI). To retain an Active status, Federal and non-Federal flood control works must continue to meet inspection criteria set by the Corps, as determined by the Corps during a Continuing Eligibility Inspection (CEI). All flood control works not in an Active status are considered to be Inactive, regardless of whether or not they have previously received a Corps inspection, or Corps assistance.

      (d)  Modification of a flood control project to increase the level of protection, or to provide protection to a larger area, is beyond the scope of Public Law 84-99 assistance. Such modifications to Federal projects are normally accomplished under congressional authorization and appropriation, or under Continuing Authorities Programs of the Corps. Such modifications to non-Federal projects are normally accomplished by the non-Federal sponsor and local interests. Modifications necessary to preserve the structural integrity of an existing non-Federal flood control project may be funded by the RIP, but such work must meet the criteria established in § 203.47 to be eligible for funding under Public Law 84-99.

      § 203.42   Inspection of non-Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.42

      (a)  The Corps will conduct inspections of non-Federal flood control works. These inspections are IEI's and CEI's. Conduct of IEI's and CEI's will be as provided for in § 203.48.

      (1) Corps involvement with any non-Federal flood control work normally begins when the sponsor requests an IEI. The Corps will conduct an IEI to determine if the flood control work meets minimum engineering and maintenance standards and is capable of providing the intended degree of flood protection. An Acceptable or Minimally Acceptable rating (see § 203.48) on the IEI is required to allow the project to gain an Active status in the RIP.

      (2) CEI's are conducted periodically to ensure that projects Active in the RIP continue to meet Corps standards, and to determine if the sponsor's maintenance program is adequate. A rating of Acceptable or Minimally Acceptable (see § 203.48) on a CEI is required in order to retain an Active status in the RIP.

      (b)  Information on the results of IEI and CEI inspections will be furnished in writing to non-Federal sponsors, and will be maintained in Corps district offices.

      (1) Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that an IEI rating of Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to remain in an Inactive status, and ineligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.

      (2) Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that a CEI rating of Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to be placed in an Inactive status, and ineligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.

      (3) Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that maintenance deficiencies found during CEI's may negatively impact on eligibility of future Rehabilitation Assistance, and the degree of local cost-sharing participation in any proposed work. Follow-up inspections can be made by the Corps to monitor progress in correcting deficiencies when warranted.

      § 203.43   Inspection of Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.43

      (a)  A completed Federal flood control project, or completed functional portions thereof, is granted Active status in the RIP upon transfer of the operation and maintenance of the project (or functional portion thereof) to the non-Federal sponsor. Federal flood control works will be periodically inspected in accordance with 33 CFR 208.10 and Engineer Regulation (ER) 1130-2-530, Flood Control Operations and Maintenance Policies. These periodic inspections of Federal flood control works are also, for simplicity, known as CEI's. If a Federal project is found to be inadequately maintained on a CEI, then it will be placed in an Inactive status in the RIP. [ This is a separate and distinct action from project deauthorization, which is not within the scope of PL 84-99 activities.] A Federal project will remain in an Inactive status until such time as an adequate maintenance program is restored, and the project is determined by the Corps to be adequately maintained.

      (b)  Information on the results of CEI inspections will be furnished in writing to non-Federal sponsors, and will be maintained in Corps district offices. Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that a CEI rating of Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to be placed in an Inactive status, and not eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance. Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that maintenance deficiencies found during CEI's may negatively impact on eligibility of future Rehabilitation Assistance, and the degree of local cost-sharing participation in any proposed work. Follow-up inspections can be made by the Corps to monitor progress in correcting deficiencies when warranted.

      § 203.44   Rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.44

      (a)  The Corps will provide assistance in the rehabilitation of non-Federal projects only when repairs are clearly beyond the normal physical and financial capabilities of the project sponsor. The urgency of the work required will be considered in determining the sponsor's capability.

      (b)  A flood control project is eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance provided that the project is in an Active status at the time of the flood event, the damage was caused by the flood event, the work can be economically justified, and the work is not otherwise prohibited by this subpart D.

      (c)  At the earliest opportunity prior to commencement of or during authorized rehabilitation work, the Corps will inform the project sponsor of any work that must be accomplished at non-Federal cost. This includes costs to correct maintenance deficiencies, and any modifications that are necessary to preserve the integrity of the project.

      (d)  Any non-Federal project constructed or modified without the appropriate local, State, tribal, and/or Federal permits, or waivers thereof, will not be rehabilitated under Public Law 84-99.

      (e)  A Cooperation Agreement is required in accordance with subpart G of this part.

      § 203.45   Rehabilitation of Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.45

      Rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects will be identical to rehabilitation of non-Federal projects (§ 203.44), except for those conditions contained in subpart G of this part concerning cooperation agreements, when the original PCA for the Federal project is sufficient. Additional requirements for Hurricane/Shore Protection Projects are covered in § 203.49.

      § 203.46   Restrictions.

#### § § 203.46

      (a)  Flood control works are designed and constructed to have appreciable and dependable protection in preventing damage from irregular and unusual rises in water levels. Structures built primarily for the purposes of channel alignment, navigation, recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement, land reclamation, habitat restoration, drainage, bank protection, or erosion protection are generally ineligible for Public Law 84-99 Rehabilitation Assistance.

      (b)  Rehabilitation of flood control structures damaged by occurrences other than floods, hurricanes, or coastal storms will generally not be provided under Public Law 84-99.

      (c)  Rehabilitation under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided for either Federal or non-Federal flood control projects that, as a result of poor maintenance or deterioration, require substantial reconstruction. All deficient or deferred maintenance existing when flood damage occurs will be accomplished by, or at the expense of, the non-Federal sponsor, either prior to or concurrently with authorized rehabilitation work. When work accomplished by the Corps corrects deferred or deficient maintenance, the estimated deferred or deficient maintenance cost will not be included as contributed non-Federal funds, and will be in addition to cost-sharing requirements addressed in § 203.82. Failure of project sponsors to correct deficiencies noted during Continuing Eligibility Inspections may result in ineligibility to receive Rehabilitation Assistance under Public Law 84-99.

      (d)  No flood control work will be rehabilitated unless the work required satisfies Corps criteria for a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio, and the construction cost of the work required exceeds $15,000. Construction costs greater than $15,000 do not preclude the Corps from making a determination that the required work is a maintenance responsibility of the non-Federal sponsor, and not eligible for Corps Rehabilitation Assistance.

      § 203.47   Modifications to non-Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.47

      Modifications necessary to preserve the structural integrity of existing non-Federal projects may be constructed at additional Federal and non-Federal expense in conjunction with approved rehabilitation work. The additional Federal cost will be limited to not more than one-third of the estimated Federal construction cost of rehabilitation to preflood level of protection, or $100,000, whichever is less. The modification work must be economically justified. Non-Federal interests are required to contribute a minimum of 25% of the total construction costs of the modification, LERRD's, and any additional funds necessary to support the remaining cost of the modification beyond what the Corps can provide. Engineering and design costs will be at Corps cost.

      (a)  Non-Federal contributions will be only in cash. In-kind services are not permitted for modification work.

      (b)  Modifications designed to provide protection to additional area are not authorized.

      § 203.48   Inspection guidelines for non-Federal flood control works.

#### § § 203.48

      (a)  The intent of these guidelines is to facilitate inspections of the design, construction, and maintenance of non-Federal flood control works. The guidelines are not intended to establish design standards for non-Federal flood control works, but to provide uniform procedures within the Corps for conducting required inspections. The results of these inspections determine Active status in the RIP, and thus determine eligibility for Rehabilitation Assistance. The contents of this section are applicable to both IEI's and CEI's.

      (b)  Evaluations of non-Federal flood control works will be made through on site inspections and technical analyses by Corps technical personnel. The level of detail required in an inspection will be commensurate with the complexity of the inspected project, the potential for catastrophic failure to cause significant loss of life, the economic benefits of the area protected, and other special circumstances that may occur. Technical evaluation procedures are intended to establish the general capability of a non-Federal flood control work to provide reliable flood protection.

      (c)  The IEI assesses the integrity and reliability of the flood control work. In addition, other essential information required to help determine the Federal interest in future repairs/rehabilitation to the flood control work will be obtained. The IEI will establish the estimated level of protection and structural reliability of the existing flood control work. Subsequent CEI's will seek to detect changed project conditions that may have an impact on the reliability of the flood protection provided by the flood control work, to include the level of maintenance being performed on the flood control work.

      (d) —(1)  The level of protection provided by a non-Federal flood control work will be evaluated and expressed in terms of exceedence frequency (e.g., a 20% chance of a levee being overtopped in any given year). These analyses also include an evaluation of existing or needed erosion control features for portions of a project that may be threatened by stream flows, overland flows, or wind generated waves.

      (2)  The Geotechnical evaluation will be based primarily on a detailed visual inspection. As a minimum, for levees, the IEI will identify critical sections where levee stability appears weakest and will document the location, reach, and cross-section at these points.

      (3)  Project maintenance analysis will evaluate the maintenance performance of the non-Federal sponsor, and deficiencies of the project. This evaluation should reflect the level of maintenance needed to assure the intended degree of flood protection, and assess the performance of recent maintenance on the project. The effects of structures on, over, or under the flood control work, such as buried fiber optic cables, gas pipelines, etc., will be evaluated for impact on the stability of the structure.

      (4)  Other features that may be present, such as pump stations, culverts, closure structures, etc., will be evaluated.

      (e)  Inspected flood control works will receive a rating in accordance with the table below. The table below provides the general assessment parameters used in assigning a rating to the inspected flood control work.

      (f)  If the results of a Corps evaluation are not acceptable to the project sponsor, the sponsor may choose, at its own expense, to provide a detailed engineering study, preferably certified by a qualified Professional Engineer, as a reclama to attempt to change the Corps evaluation.

      § 203.49   Rehabilitation of Hurricane and Shore Protection Projects.

#### § § 203.49

      (a)  The Chief of Engineers is authorized to rehabilitate any Federally authorized hurricane or shore protection structure damaged or destroyed by wind, wave, or water action of an other than ordinary nature when, in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers, such rehabilitation is warranted for the adequate functioning of the project.

      (b)  (1) Rehabilitation of HSPP's is limited to the repair/restoration of the HSPP to a pre-storm condition that allows for the adequate functioning of the project, provided that the damage was caused by an extraordinary storm.

      (2) To be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance, HSPP's must be:

      (i) A completed element of a Federally authorized project; or,

      (ii) A portion of a Federally authorized project constructed by non-Federal interests when approval of such construction was obtained from the Commander, Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE), or his designated representative; or,

      (iii) A portion of a Federally authorized project constructed by non-Federal interests and designated by an Act of Congress as a Federal project; and

      (3) Rehabilitation Assistance for sacrificial features will be limited to that necessary to reduce the immediate threat to life and property, or restoration to pre-storm conditions, whichever is less.

      (4) To be eligible for rehabilitation, the sacrificial features of an HSPP must be substantially eroded by wind, wave, or water action of an other than ordinary nature. The determination of whether a storm qualifies as extraordinary will be made by the Director of Civil Works, and may be delegated to the Chief, Operations Division, Directorate of Civil Works.

      (5) Rehabilitation will not be provided for uncompleted HSPP's. An HSPP (or separable portion thereof) is considered completed when transferred to the non-Federal sponsor for operation and maintenance.

      (6)  An extraordinary storm is a storm that, due to prolongation or severity, creates weather conditions that cause significant amounts of damage to a Hurricane/Shore Protection Project. “Prolongation or severity” means a Category 3 or higher hurricane as measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale, or a storm that has an exceedance frequency equal to or greater than the design storm of the project. “Significant amounts of damage” have occurred when:

      (i) The cost of the construction effort to effect repair of the HSPP or separable element thereof (exclusive of dredge mobilization and demobilization costs) exceeds $1 million and is greater than two percent of the original construction cost (expressed in current day dollars) of the HSPP or separable element thereof; or,

      (ii) The cost of the construction effort to effect repair of the HSPP or separable element thereof (exclusive of dredge mobilization and demobilization costs) exceeds $6 million; or,

      (iii) More than one-third of the planned or historically placed sand for renourishment efforts for the HSPP (or separable element thereof) is lost.

      (c)  Rehabilitation of HSPP'S will be done in accordance with § 203.45, except as modified by this section.

      (d)  In some cases, the non-Federal sponsor may wish to fully restore the sacrificial features of a project where only a partial restoration is justifiable as Rehabilitation Assistance. In these cases, a cost allocation between Rehabilitation Assistance and periodic nourishment under the terms of the project PCA will be determined by the Director of Civil Works.

      § 203.50   Nonstructural alternatives to rehabilitation of flood control works.

#### § § 203.50

      (a)  Under Public Law 84-99, the Chief of Engineers is authorized, when requested by the non-Federal sponsor, to implement nonstructural alternatives (NSA's) to the rehabilitation, repair, or restoration of flood control works damaged by floods or coastal storms.

      (b)  (1) The option of implementing an NSA project (NSAP) in lieu of a structural repair or restoration is available only to non-Federal sponsors of flood control works eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance in accordance with this regulation, and only upon the request of such non-Federal sponsors.

      (2) A sponsor is required for implementation of an NSAP. The NSAP sponsor must be either a non-Federal sponsor as defined in § 203.15, or another Federal agency. The NSAP sponsor must demonstrate that it has the legal authority and financial capability to provide for the required items of local cooperation.

      (3) The Corps shall not be responsible for the operation, maintenance, or management of any NSAP implemented in accordance with this section.

      (4) The Corps may, in its sole discretion, reject any request for an NSA that would:

      (i) Lead to significantly increased flood protection expenses or flood fighting expenses for public agencies, flood control works sponsors, public utilities, or the Federal Government; or,

      (ii) Threaten or have a significant adverse impact on the integrity, stability, or level of protection of adjacent or nearby flood control works; or,

      (iii) Lead to increased risk of loss of life or property during flood events.

      (5) The principal purposes of an NSAP are for:

      (i) Floodplain restoration;

      (ii) Provision or restoration of floodways; and,

      (iii) Reduction of future flood damages and associated flood control works repair costs.

      (c)  Exclusive of the costs of investigation, report preparation, engineering and design work, and related costs, Corps expenditures for implementation of an NSAP are limited to the lesser of the Federal share of rehabilitation construction costs of the project were the flood control work to be structurally rehabilitated in accordance with subpart D of this part, or the Federal share of computed benefits which would be derived from such structural rehabilitation. This limitation on Corps expenditures may be waived by the Director of Civil Works or the Chief, Operations Division, Directorate of Civil Works when compelling reasons exist.

      (d)  (1) Operate and maintain the NSAP;

      (2) Provide, or arrange for and obtain, all funding required to implement the NSAP in excess of the limitation established in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (3) Accept the transfer of ownership of any lands or interests in lands acquired by the Corps and determined by the Corps to be necessary to implement the NSAP.

      (e)  The Corps may participate with one or more Federal agencies in NSAP's. If the Corps is the lead Federal agency, based on mutual agreement of the Federal agencies, then a non-Federal NSAP sponsor is required. ( paragraph (d) of this section.) If another Federal agency is the lead Federal agency, then Corps participation in the NSAP will be based on the content of this section, with appropriate allowances for effecting an NSAP in accordance with the authority and ultimate goal of the lead Federal agency. In such cases, a Memorandum of Agreement between the Corps and the lead Federal agency is required, in accordance with paragraph (1) of this section.

      (f)  (1) The flood control work project sponsor must request the Corps undertake an NSA project in lieu of rehabilitation of the flood control work, in accordance with the sponsor's applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

      (2) If not also the NSAP sponsor, the flood control work project sponsor must:

      (i) Divest itself of responsibility to operate and maintain the flood control work involved in the NSAP; and

      (ii) Provide to the NSAP sponsor such lands or interests in lands as it may have which the Corps determines are necessary to implement the NSAP.

      (g)  (1) Acquisition of land or interests in land.

      (2) Removal of structures, including manufactured homes, for salvage and/or reuse purposes.

      (3) Demolition and removal of structures, including utility connections and related items.

      (4) Debris removal and debris reduction.

      (5) Removal, protection, and/or relocation of highways, roads, utilities, cemeteries, and railroads.

      (6) Construction to promote, enhance, control, or modify water flows into, out of, through, or around the nonstructural project area.

      (7) Nonstructural habitat restoration, to include select planting of native and desirable plant species, native species nesting site enhancements, etc.

      (8) Total or partial removal or razing of existing reaches of levee, to include removal of bank protection features and/or riprap.

      (9) Protection/floodproofing of essential structures and facilities.

      (10) Supervision, administrative, and contract administration costs of other expenses allowed in this subparagraph.

      (h)  Corps participation in development and implementation of an NSAP may cease, at the sole discretion of the Corps, one year after the date of approval of rehabilitation of the damaged flood control work or the date of receipt of the flood control work public sponsor's request for an NSAP, whichever is earlier, if insufficient progress is being made to develop and implement the NSAP for reasons beyond the control of the Corps. In such circumstances, the Corps may, at its sole discretion, determine that Rehabilitation Assistance for the damaged flood control project may also be denied.

      (i)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the participation of other Federal, State, tribal, local, and private agencies in the development, implementation, or future operations and maintenance of an NSAP under this section, subject to the limitations of such participating agency's authorities and regulations.

      (j)  After transfer of NSAP operation and maintenance responsibility to the NSAP sponsor or the lead Federal agency, flood-related assistance pursuant to Public Law 84-99 will not be provided anywhere within the formerly protected area of the flood control work, except for rescue operations provided in accordance with § 203.13(b). As an exception, on a case-by-case basis, certain structural flood control works (or elements thereof) repaired or set back as part of the implementation of an NSAP having a non-Federal sponsor may be considered for future flood-related assistance.

      (k)  NSAP's are subject to the same environmental requirements, restrictions, and limitations as are structural rehabilitation projects.

      (l) —(1)  In order to clearly define the obligations of the Corps and of non-Federal interests, a CA with the NSAP non-Federal sponsor is required. Requirements are addressed in paragraphs (l)(2) through (10) of this section. When another Federal agency is the lead Federal agency, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Corps and that agency is required. Wording of MOA's will be similar to, and consistent with, requirements detailed in paragraphs (l)(2) through (10) of this section for CA's, with appropriate modifications based on the other Federal agencies' authorized expenditures and programs.

      (2) The CA requirements of subpart G of this part are not applicable to NSAP's.

      (3)  For NSAP's, non-Federal interests shall:

      (i) Provide without cost to the United States all borrow sites and dredged or excavated material disposal areas necessary for the project;

      (ii) Hold and save the United States free from damages due to the project, except for damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractor; and

      (iii) Maintain and operate the project after completion in a manner satisfactory to the Chief of Engineers.

      (4)  The Corps may assume up to 100 percent of the costs of implementing an NSAP, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (5)  NSAP CA's shall not prohibit non-Federal interests from accepting funding from other Federal agencies, so long as the provision of such other Federal agency funding is not prohibited by statute.

      (6)  Contributed funds may be accepted without further approval by the Chief of Engineers upon execution of the CA by all parties. The required certificate of the district commander will cite 33 U.S.C. 701h as the pertinent authority.

      (7)  In accordance with OMB Circular A-34, all contributed funds must be received in cash and deposited with the Treasury before any obligations can be made against such funds.

      (8)  The prohibition of future assistance described in paragraph (j) of this section must be included in the NSAP CA.

      (9)  NSAP CA's shall include acknowledgment of, and a statement of planned adherence to, Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, 3 CFR 117 (1977 Compilation), or as it may be revised in the future, by the NSAP sponsor.

      (10) The CA must include a statement of legal restrictions placed on formerly protected lands that would preclude future use and/or development of such lands in a fashion incompatible with the purposes of the NSAP.

      (m)  (1) For the acquisition of LERRD's, reimbursement may be made to the non-Federal sponsor of an NSAP. Such reimbursements are subject to the normal Corps land acquisition process, funding caps set forth in (c) of this section, and availability of appropriations.

      (2) For the acquisition of LERRD's, Corps funding may be combined with the funding of other Federal agencies, absent specific statutory language or principle prohibiting such combinations, under the terms of the MOA with other Federal agencies.

      § 203.51   Levee owner's manual.

#### § § 203.51

      (a)  In accordance with section 202(f) of Public Law 104-303, the Corps will provide a levee owner's manual to the non-Federal sponsor of all flood control works in an Active status in the RIP.

      (b) —(1)  A levee owner's manual developed and distributed by the Corps will be provided to all sponsors of _Active non-Federal projects._ The levee owner's manual will include the standards that must be met to maintain an Active status in the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program. Levee owner's manuals will also be provided, upon request, to sponsors of Inactive non-Federal projects so that the sponsors may evaluate their projects and prepare for an IEI to gain an Active status in the RIP.

      (2)  The Operation and Maintenance Manual specified by 33 CFR 208.10(a)(10) will fulfill the requirement of providing a levee owner's manual if the Corps has not provided a separate levee owner's manual to the sponsor of a Federal project.

      (c)  Levee Owner's Manuals will be initially provided to non-Federal sponsors of Active flood control works during scheduled CEI's and IEI's. Sponsors of Inactive projects and private levee owners will be provided manuals upon written request to the responsible Corps district.

#### § § 203.52

    Subpart E—Emergency Water Supplies: Contaminated Water Sources and Drought Assistance

      § 203.61   Emergency water supplies due to contaminated water source.

#### § § 203.61

      (a)  The Chief of Engineers is authorized to provide emergency supplies of clean water to any locality confronted with a source of contaminated water causing, or likely to cause, a substantial threat to the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the locality.

      (b)  (1) Any locality faced with a threat to public health and welfare from a contaminated source of drinking water is eligible for assistance.

      (2) Eligibility for assistance will be based on one or more of the following factors:

      (i) The maximum contaminant level  treatment technique f_or_ a contaminant, as established by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act ( 40 CFR 141), is exceeded.

      (ii) The water supply has been identified as a source of illness by a tribal, State, or Federal public health official. The specific contaminant does not have to be identified.

      (iii) An emergency (e.g., a flood or chemical spill) has occurred that has resulted in either: one or more contaminants entering the source on a sufficient scale to endanger health; or, the emergency has made inoperable the equipment necessary to remove known contaminants.

      (iv) The presence of a contaminant is indicated on the basis of other information available.

      (3) Corps assistance will be directed toward the provision of the minimum amount of water required to maintain the health and welfare requirements of the affected population. The quantity of water and the means of distribution will be at the discretion of the responsible Corps official, who will consider the needs of the individual situation, the needs of the affected community, and the cost effectiveness of providing water by various methods.

      (4) If a locality has multiple sources of water, assistance will be furnished only to the extent that the remaining sources, with reasonable conservation measures, cannot provide adequate supplies of drinking water.

      (5) Loss of water supply is not a basis for assistance under this authority.

      (6) Water will not be furnished for commercial processes, except as incidental to the use of existing distribution systems. This does not prohibit the furnishing of water for drinking by employees and on-site customers. Water for preparing retail meals and similar personal needs may be provided to the extent it would be furnished to individuals.

      (7) The permanent restoration of a safe supply of drinking water is the responsibility of local interests.

      (8) Corps assistance is limited to 30 days, and requires the local interests to provide assurances of cooperation in a CA. ( subpart G of this part.) Extension of this 30-day period requires agreement (as an amendment to the previously signed CA) between the State and the Corps. This agreement must cover specified services and responsibilities of each party, and provision of a firm schedule for local interests to provide normal supplies of water.

      (9) State, tribal, and local governments must make full use of their own resources, including National Guard capabilities.

      (c)  A letter signed by the Governor, or his or her authorized representative, requesting Corps assistance and addressing the State's commitments and capabilities in response to the emergency situation, is required. All requests should identify the following information:

      (1) Describe the local and State efforts undertaken. Verify that all reasonably available resources have been committed.

      (2) Identify the specific needs of the State, and the required Corps assistance.

      (3) Identify additional commitments to be accomplished by the State.

      (4) Identify the project sponsor(s).

      (d)  Non-Federal interests are responsible for restoration of the routine supply of clean drinking water, including correcting any situations that cause contamination. If assistance is furnished by the Corps, local interests must furnish the basic requirements of local cooperation as detailed in the Cooperation Agreement. In all cases, reasonable water conservation measures must be implemented. Local interests will be required to operate and maintain any loaned equipment, and to remove and return such equipment to Federal interests, in a fully maintained condition, after the situation is resolved.

      § 203.62   Drought assistance.

#### § § 203.62

      (a)  The Chief of Engineers, acting for the Secretary of the Army, has the authority under certain statutory conditions to construct wells for farmers, ranchers, political subdivisions, and to transport water to political subdivisions, within areas determined to be drought-distressed.

      (b)  (1) It is a non-Federal responsibility for providing an adequate supply of water to local inhabitants. Corps assistance to provide emergency water supplies will only be considered when non-Federal interests have exhausted reasonable means for securing necessary water supplies, including assistance and support from other Federal agencies.

      (2) Before Corps assistance is considered under this authority, the applicability of other Federal assistance authorities must be evaluated. If these programs cannot provide the needed assistance, then maximum coordination should be made with appropriate agencies in implementing Corps assistance.

      (c)  A letter signed by the Governor, requesting Corps assistance and addressing the State's commitments and capabilities with response to the emergency situation, is required. All requests should identify the following information:

      (1) A description of local and State efforts undertaken. A verification that all available resources have been committed, to include National Guard assets.

      (2) Identification of the specific needs of the State, and the required Corps assistance.

      (3) Identification of the additional commitments to be accomplished by the State.

      (4) Identification of the project sponsor(s).

      (d) —(1)  This term includes initial construction, reconstruction, or repair.

      (2)  An area that the Secretary of the Army determines, due to drought conditions, has an inadequate water supply that is causing, or is likely to cause, a substantial threat to the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the impacted area, including the threat of damage or loss of property.

      (3)  Any rancher, farmer or political subdivision within a designated drought-distressed area that is experiencing an inadequate supply of water due to drought.

      (4)  An individual who realizes at least one-third of his or her gross annual income from agricultural sources, and is recognized in the community as a farmer or rancher. A farming partnership, corporation, or similar entity engaged in farming or ranching, which receives its majority income from such activity, is also considered to be a farmer or rancher, and thus an eligible applicant.

      (5)  A city, town, borough, county, parish, district, association, or other public body created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law, having jurisdiction over the water supply of such public body.

      (6)  In connection with the Corps construction of a well, means the lesser of:

      (i) The cost of the Chief of Engineers to construct a well in accordance with these regulations, exclusive of:

      (A) The cost of transporting equipment used in the construction of wells, and

      (B) The cost of investigation and report preparation to determine the suitability to construct a well, or,

      (ii) The cost to a private business of constructing such a well.

      (7)  Any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Marianas Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

      (e)  (1) Assistance to an eligible applicant for the construction of a well may be provided on a cost-reimbursable basis if:

      (i) It is in response to a written request by a farmer, rancher, or political subdivision for construction of a well under Public Law 84-99.

      (ii) The applicant is located within an area that the Secretary of the Army has determined to be drought-distressed.

      (iii) The Secretary of the Army has made a determination that:

      (A) The applicant, as a result of the drought, has an inadequate supply of water.

      (B) An adequate supply of water can be made available to the applicant through the construction of a well.

      (C) As a result of the drought, a private business could not construct the well within a reasonable time.

      (iv) The applicant has secured the necessary funding for well construction from commercial or other sources, or has entered into a contract to pay to the United States the reasonable cost of such construction with interest over a period of years, not to exceed 30, as the Secretary of the Army deems appropriate.

      (v) The applicant has obtained all necessary Federal, State and local permits.

      (2) The financing of the cost of construction of a well by the Corps under this authority should be secured by the project applicant.

      (3) The project applicant will provide the necessary assurances of local cooperation by signing a Cooperation Agreement (subpart G of this part) prior to the start of Corps work under this authority.

      (4) Equipment owned by the United States will be utilized to the maximum extent possible in exercising the authority to drill wells, but can only be used when commercial firms cannot provide comparable service within the time needed to prevent the applicant from suffering significantly increased hardships from the effects of an inadequate water supply.

      (f)  (1) Assistance to an applicant in the transportation of water may be provided if:

      (i) It is in response to a written request by a political subdivision for transportation of water.

      (ii) The applicant is located within an area that the Secretary of the Army has determined to be drought-distressed.

      (iii) The Secretary of the Army has made a determination that, as a result of the drought, the applicant has an inadequate supply of water for human consumption, and the applicant cannot obtain water.

      (2) Transportation of water by vehicles, small diameter pipe line, or other means will be at 100 percent Federal cost.

      (3) Corps assistance in the transportation of emergency water supplies will be provided only in connection with water needed for human consumption. Assistance will not be provided in connection with water needed for irrigation, recreation, or other non-life supporting purposes, or livestock consumption.

      (4) Corps assistance will not include the purchase of water, nor the cost of loading or discharging the water into or from any Government conveyance, to include Government-leased conveyance.

      (5) Equipment owned by the United States will be utilized to the maximum extent possible in exercising the authority to transport water, consistent with lowest total Federal cost.

      (g)  A written request must be made to the district commander with Civil Works responsibility for the affected area. Upon receipt of a written request, the appropriate State and Federal agencies will be notified, and coordination will continue as appropriate throughout the assistance.

    Subpart F—Advance Measures

      § 203.71   Policy.

#### § § 203.71

      Advance Measures consists of those activities performed prior to a flood event, or potential flood event, to protect against loss of life and/or significant damages to improved property from flooding. Emergency work under this authority will be considered when requested by the Governor of a State confronted with an imminent threat of unusual flooding. Corps assistance will be to complement the maximum efforts of tribal, State, and local authorities. Projects will be designed for the specific threat, normally of expedient-type construction, and typically temporary in nature.

      § 203.72   Eligibility criteria and procedures.

#### § § 203.72

      (a)  An  threat of  flooding must exist before Advance Measures projects can be approved. The threat may be established by National Weather Service predictions, or by Corps of Engineers determinations of _unusual_ flooding from adverse or unusual conditions. The threat must be clearly defined to the extent that it is readily apparent that damages will be incurred if preventive action is not taken immediately.

      (b)  A letter signed by the Governor, requesting Corps assistance and addressing the State's commitments and capabilities with response to the emergency situation, is required. All requests should identify the following information:

      (1) Describe the non-Federal efforts undertaken. Verify that all available resources have been committed.

      (2) Identify the specific needs, and the required Corps assistance.

      (3) Identify additional commitments to be accomplished by the non-Federal interests.

      (4) Identify the non-Federal sponsor(s).

      (c)  The proposed work should be temporary in nature, technically feasible, designed to deal effectively and efficiently with the specific threat, and capable of construction in time to prevent anticipated damages.

      (d)  All work undertaken under this category must have a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio, under Corps of Engineers economic guidelines.

      (e)  Subpart G of this part provides requirements for a Cooperation Agreement needed to provide local assurances. The project sponsor must remove temporary works constructed by the Corps when the operation is over, at no cost to the Corps.

      (f)  Occasionally weather phenomena occur which produce a much higher than normal probability or threat of flooding which may be predicted several months in advance of occurrence or significant impact. Impacts on specific locations may be unpredictable, but regional impacts may have a high likelihood of occurrence. In such situations, the Corps may provide technical and contingency planning assistance to tribal, State, and local agencies, commensurate with the predicted weather phenomenon, based on requests for assistance from such tribal, State, and local agencies. Specific Advance Measures projects must be addressed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (g) —(1)  A subjective statistical evaluation of how quickly a threat scenario can develop, and how likely that threat is to develop in a given geographical location. Implicit in the timing aspect can be considerations of available time (when the next flood or storm event is likely to occur), season (e.g., a snowpack that will melt in the coming spring runoff), or of known cyclical activities.

      (2)  A subjective determination that considers potential ability to approach an area's flood of record, a catastrophic level of flooding, or a greater than 50-year level of flooding.

    Subpart G—Local Interests/Cooperation Agreements

      § 203.81   General.

#### § § 203.81

      (a)  In order to maintain a firm understanding between the Corps and non-Federal interests concerning the responsibilities of each party in responding to or recovering from a natural disaster, division or district commanders shall negotiate a cooperation agreement (CA) with a non-Federal sponsor whenever assistance (other than short term technical assistance) is furnished. CA's do not require approval by HQUSACE unless they contain special or unusual conditions. For assistance to other than a public entity, a public agency is required to be the non-Federal sponsor, co-sign the agreement, and be responsible, from the Corps perspective, for accomplishment of all work and conditions required in the CA. Project sponsors must meet the definition contained in § 203.15.

      (b)  (1) For urgent situations involving Flood Response activities, division/district commanders may respond to oral requests from responsible representatives of local interests. However, all oral requests must be confirmed in writing. Assistance can be furnished before the written statement is received.

      (2) Before furnishing assistance (other than short term technical assistance) under Advance Measures, or under Emergency Water Supplies, the district/division commander must receive a request, signed by the Governor (or the Governor's representative for Emergency Water assistance due to a contaminated source), identifying the problem, verifying that all available State and local resources have been committed, and requesting Federal assistance.

      § 203.82   Requirements of local cooperation.

#### § § 203.82

      It is Corps policy that provision of assistance under Public Law 84-99 will, insofar as feasible, require local interests to: provide without cost to the United States all LERRD's necessary for the authorized work; hold and save the United States free from damages due to the authorized work, exclusive of damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractor; maintain and operate, in a manner satisfactory to the Chief of Engineers, all the works after completion. When assistance includes the construction of temporary protective works, the maintain and operate clause is modified by adding (or substituting, as applicable) the requirement for local interests to remove any temporary works constructed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99. If any permanent works are constructed, then the sponsor is required to operate and maintain the project in accordance with requirements determined by the Corps.

      (a)  This item provides for sites of structures, for borrow and disposal areas, and for access. It also provides for all other rights in, upon, through, or over private property as needed by the United States in connection with the authorized work. Performance by the local interests under their assurance to furnish LERRD's will normally not be considered a contribution. If more advantageous to the Federal Government, borrow and disposal areas may be assumed as a Federal responsibility. Easements must be provided for future Federal inspection of maintenance or removal. If a public agency sponsors a project for a non-public applicant, the applicant must provide an easement to the sponsor for future maintenance or removal, as well as for Federal inspection. Easements should extend to the life of the project.

      (b)  This clause serves as legal protection of the government. Where property concerned is under tenancy, both the property owner and the tenant should acknowledge the non-Federal sponsor's signed CA.

      (c)  This item is intended to protect the investment of government resources and provide proper stewardship of resources entrusted to the Corps. This clause must include: “It is understood that the foregoing maintenance and operation requirement extends to interrelated features of all protective work under the control of (insert name of sponsor, and owner if appropriate).”

      (d)  Local interests are responsible for the removal of all temporary works constructed by the Corps, which are unsuitable for upgrade to permanent structures. Structures may be deemed unsuitable due to inherent health, access, or safety problems that could result from their location. The wording of this clause must not preclude the use of other Federal assistance programs to fund removal.

      (e)  Local interests may ask to retain a temporary structure for protection from future floods. This will not be approved by the Corps unless the works are upgraded to meet all Corps criteria for permanent projects. Public Law 84-99 funds will not be used to upgrade the structure. An upgraded project must comply with permitting, environmental, and other regulatory and legal requirements. Unless upgraded, such projects are not eligible for rehabilitation, and must be removed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless upgraded, temporary projects which are not removed by the local sponsor will cause all projects with the same sponsor to lose eligibility for Public Law 84-99 assistance. Local interests must initiate action to upgrade or remove the temporary works within 30 days after the flood threat has passed.

      (f)  (1) The Federal Government may assume up to 80 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects, and up to 100 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects. The Federal Government may assume up to 100 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of HSPP's. Sponsors will provide their share of costs as provided for in § 203.84. The sponsor's share is in addition to providing costs for LERRD's, and any costs for correction of any deferred/deficient maintenance. The Corps will determine the dollar value of any in-kind services provided by the local sponsor.

      (2) For those unusual occasions where permanent construction (vice the temporary standard) for Advance Measures projects is employed, the local sponsor will normally be required to provide 25 percent of the project cost, in addition to LERRD's.

      § 203.83   Additional requirements.

#### § § 203.83

      (a)  Rehabilitation, Emergency Water, Post Flood Response, and Advance Measures authorities may not be used to correct deferred or deficient maintenance. Such correction must be accomplished by, or at the expense of, local interests. This may include restoring normal levee or dune height after subsidence, replacement of deteriorated components such as outlet structures and pipes, removal of debris, and new construction items such as protection against erosion. This restriction on use of these authorities does not preclude furnishing flood fight assistance during an emergency.

      (b)  Separable areas with minor damage will be included in the maintenance program of local interests.

      (c)  Local interests should be responsible for minor completion items, such as dressing fills, placing sod, or seeding completed work.

      (d)  In determining the adequacy of the pledge of local cooperation, district/division commanders must consider the local sponsor's performance capability, taking into account any shortcomings in meeting prior commitments. Local sponsors should make provisions to establish and provide resources for a “Contingency Fund” to meet future maintenance requirements if apparent inadequacies of protective works indicate maintenance costs will be unusually high. Local sponsors should make provisions to establish and provide resources for a “Capital Improvement Fund” to meet future costs of capital improvement projects such as replacement of culverts in levees, pump station equipment, etc.

      (e)  The Cooperation Agreement must be worded to allow local interests to accept funding from other Federal programs for meeting the local responsibility. For example, removal of temporary works will be without cost under Corps Public Law 84-99 assistance, but will not be “at no cost to the United States.” Use of another Federal agency's funds is contingent upon that agency providing the Corps written assurance that such usage does not violate any existing laws or rules concerning the usage or expenditure of such funds.

      § 203.84   Forms of local participation—cost sharing.

#### § § 203.84

      In addition to the standard requirements of local cooperation and according to the circumstances, local participation in project work may be in the form of: contributed funds; the furnishing of materials, equipment, or services; and/or accomplishment of work either concurrently or within a specified reasonable period of time. The final terms agreed upon will be set forth in writing and made a part of the CA before commencement of work.

      (a)  Contributed funds may be accepted, or refunded, without further reference or approval by the Chief of Engineers. The required certificate of the district commander will cite 33 U.S.C. 701h as the pertinent authority.

      (b)  Per OMB Circular A-34, all contributed funds must be received in cash and deposited with the Treasury before any obligations can be made against such funds. Public Law 84-99 assistance for well construction is exempted from this requirement because financing is specifically authorized. However, the CA for such well construction assistance ( subpart G of this part) must be signed in advance of any obligations. To reduce administrative problems, CA terms for well construction should be for no longer a period than that which will allow for payments within the means of the applicant. Public Law 84-99 limits the term to a maximum of 30 years.

      (c)  To the extent practicable, local interests should be allowed to minimize the amount of contributed funds by providing equivalent work or services in kind. Such services do not include LERRD's.

      § 203.85   Rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects.

#### § § 203.85

      Some sponsors of Federal flood control projects are not required to furnish written assurances of local cooperation, when such assurances already exist from the PCA of the original construction of the project. In lieu of a new PCA, the Corps will notify the sponsor, in writing, of the sponsor's standing requirements. These requirements include such items as LERRD's, costs attributable to deficient or deferred maintenance, removal of temporary works, cost-sharing requirements, and any other requirements contained in § 203.82. The project sponsor must acknowledge its responsibilities prior to the provision of Rehabilitation Assistance. If the existing PCA does not adequately address responsibilities, then a CA will be required.

      § 203.86   Transfer of completed work to local interests.

#### § § 203.86

      Responsibility for operation and maintenance of a project for which emergency work under Public Law 84-99 is undertaken will always remain with the non-Federal sponsor throughout the process, and thereafter. The Corps will notify the non-Federal sponsor by letter when repair/rehabilitation/work efforts are completed. Detailed instructions, and suggestions relative to proper maintenance and operation, may be furnished as an enclosure to this letter. The letter will remind the local interests that they are responsible for satisfactory maintenance of the flood control works in accordance with the terms of the PCA or CA. In appropriate cases for Federal projects, refer to the “Flood Control Regulation for Maintenance and Operation of Flood Control Works: (33 CFR 208)” or the project's Operation and Maintenance Manual. Reporting requirements placed on the non-Federal sponsor will vary according to organization and other circumstances.

### Part 207

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1; 33 U.S.C. 555; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note.

    § 207.9   Mystic River, Mass.; dam of Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Metropolitan District Commission.

#### § § 207.9

    (a)  The term superintendent as used in the regulations in this section shall mean himself and/or his personnel then on duty at the dam. The positioning and movements of all watercraft of every description while in the locks or within 100 yards of the locks or dam shall be subject to the direction of the superintendent whose orders must be obeyed. This order does not relieve the master of the responsibility for the safety of his vessel.

    (b)  There are three (3) locks to be used for the passage of vessels; one large lock 325 feet long, 45 feet wide, shall be used for vessels with draft up to seventeen (17) feet; two small locks each 120 feet long and 22 feet wide shall be used for boats up to six (6) feet draft.

    (c)  Vessels drawing within six (6) inches of depth over the sills shall not be permitted lockage except under special permission of the superintendent. Every vessel using the locks and drawing more than ten (10) feet shall be accurately and distinctly marked at bow and stern showing the exact draft of water at such portions of the vessel. Gages set into the walls or the locks, both upstream and downstream of each gate, indicate the depth in feet of water over the sill of the gate.

    (d)  The superintendent may deny passage through the locks to any craft with sharp, rough projecting corners, overhanging equipment or cargo, or any craft or two that is in sinking condition or in any way unseaworthy or insufficiently manned and equipped, or any craft failing to comply with the regulations in this section or with any orders given in pursuance thereof.

    (e)  (1) In no case shall boats be permitted to enter or leave any of the locks until directed to do so by the superintendent. Boats shall not be permitted to enter or start to leave until the lock gates are at rest within the gate recesses. All persons, whether in charge of vessels or not, are prohibited from willfully or carelessly damaging the locks or any of the appurtenances or the grounds adjacent thereto, and from throwing or allowing any material of any kind to fall from the barge, scow or other vessel into the locks.

    (2) No person shall permit or suffer any vessel, scow, raft, or float to come in contract with any gate or any of the locks of the Amelia Earhart Dam.

    (f)  The sides of all craft passing through the locks must be free from projection of any kind which might injure the lock walls. All craft must be provided with suitable fenders. One or more men as the superintendent may direct shall be kept at the head of every tow until it has cleared the lock and guide walls, and shall protect the walls by use of the fenders.

    (g)  No person shall cause or permit any craft of which he is in charge to remain in the locks or their approaches for a longer period of time than is necessary for the passage of the locks unless he is especially permitted to do so by the superintendent, and if such craft is, in the opinion of such superintendent, in a position to obstruct navigation, it shall be removed at once as requested or directed by the superintendent.

    (h)  The locks shall be operated promptly for the passage of all craft upon signal, excepting only in such cases as are specifically provided for in the regulations in this section. All registered merchant vessels shall pass through the locks in the order directed by the superintendent. Other craft shall be allowed to pass through the locks at the discretion of the superintendent.

    (i)  (1) All barges navigating the locks whether approaching or leaving the locks are required to be assisted by one or more tugs of sufficient power to insure full control at all times. All craft approaching the locks while any other vessel going in the opposite direction is in or about to enter shall be stopped where they will not obstruct the free passage of such other vessel.

    (2) All vessels over 100 gross tons including those which are accompanied by towboats must attach not less than two good and sufficient lines, cables, or hawsers to the bollards or other fixtures provided for the purpose to check the speed of the vessel and to stop it as soon as it has gone far enough to permit the lock gate behind it to be closed. Each line, cable, or hawser shall be attended on board while passing into the lock by one or more of the vessel's crew. Where vessels are so long that in order to get them wholly within the locks it is necessary to go within 100 feet of the lock gate ahead, the speed of the vessel must be slow and the vessel must be fully under control at all times by the lines, cables or hawsers. All towboats and vessels less than 100 gross tons may enter the locks without having lines out subject to the discretion of the superintendent. The master or person in charge of a vessel shall arrange to have any line, cable, or hawser handed or thrown from the lock walls by the superintendent, or his assistants, made fast on the vessel as requested or directed, so that in cases of emergency such line, cable, or hawser may also be used to check the speed of and stop the vessel.

    (3) Operators of vessels less than 200 gross tons may use the floating moorings in the large lock to fasten lines or hawsers, but they shall not be used to check the way on any vessel greater than 30 gross tons.

    (4) Vessels less than 30 gross tons may fasten lines to the floating moorings in the large or small locks. All persons shall keep off the floating moorings at all times.

    (5) No line shall be attached to anything on or a part of the dam except the fixtures provided for this purpose.

    (6) Equipment of each craft shall include a sufficient bow line and stern line.

    (j)  When a craft is in position in the lock, it shall be securely fastened in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent to prevent the craft moving about while the lock is being filled or emptied, and the lines, cables, or hawsers used for this purpose shall be attended as far as is necessary or required while the filling or emptying is in progress.

    (k) [Reserved]

    (l)  (1) All craft desiring lockage shall, on approaching the locks, signal by two long and two short blasts of a whistle or other sound device. Two long blasts from the lock in reply will indicate a delayed opening and direct the craft not to enter the lock.

    (2) Lights are located at each end of each lock and will normally show red. No vessel shall come within 100 feet of the outside of any gate when the signal is red except when so directed by the superintendent.

    (3) Fireboats and craft owned by the U.S. Government shall be given prompt and preferential lockage when they sound four long blasts.

    (4) No vessel shall move into or out of any lock until the controlling signal is green. A green light in addition to audio loud speakers, operated by the superintendent or his assistants, will direct craft through the locks.

    (5) It shall be the duty of every master or person in charge of any vessel to ascertain by personal observation that the lock gate is fully open before proceeding.

    (m)  Lock employees only shall be permitted to operate the lock gates, signals or other appliances. No person shall deface or injure any part of the Amelia Earhart Dam, or any pier, wall or other structure or any mechanism connected therewith; nor shall any person, without the consent of the superintendent, make fast to the dam, guard, guide wall, pier, or any appurtenance thereof any vessel, scow, raft, or float.

    (n)  A copy of the regulations in this section shall be kept at all times on board each vessel regularly engaged in navigating the locks. Copies may be obtained without charge from the superintendent; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, M.D.C. Parks Division, Boston, Mass.; New England Division, Corps of Engineers, Division Engineer, Waltham, Mass.

    § 207.10   Charles River, Mass.; dam of Charles River Basin Commission.

#### § § 207.10

    (a) The movements of all vessels or boats in and near the lock shall be under the direction of the superintendent in charge of these structures and his assistants, whose orders and signals shall be obeyed.

    (b) Every vessel using the lock and drawing more than 10 feet shall be accurately and distinctly marked at the bow and stern, showing the exact draft of water at such portions of the vessel.

    (c) All steam vessels desiring to pass through the lock shall signal for the same by two long and two short blasts of the whistle.

    (d)(1) All vessels passing through the lock shall have their outboard spars, if any, rigged in, and booms amidships, and secured. All standing and running rigging must be triced in to keep it from blowing out and fouling the drawbridge. Every vessel of 200 tons and under shall be provided with at least two, and every vessel of more than 200 tons shall be provided with at least four good and sufficient lines, cables, or hawsers. Anchors shall either be stowed or shall hang from hawse pipes, hauled up close, clear of the water if possible. Vessels with anchors under foot or hanging from catheads will not be permitted to enter the lock.

    (2) All vessels must be sufficiently manned and must have a sufficient number of round and fore-and-aft fenders to protect the lock from injury. All heavy rope fenders must be securely lashed to prevent their falling into the lock and interfering with the gates.

    (e) All vessels approaching the lock while any other vessel going in the opposite direction is in or about to enter it shall be stopped where they will not obstruct the free passage of such other vessel.

    (f) It shall be the duty of every master or person in charge of any vessel upon approaching the lock from the upstream end to ascertain by personal observation whether or not the upper lock gate is open, and a vessel shall not be permitted to come within 100 feet of the upper lock gate until the gate has been wholly withdrawn into its recess.

    (g) All towboats, whether towing or not, and other steam vessels of less than 100 tons gross may enter the lock under their own power and without having lines out, but all other vessels, including those which are accompanied by towboats, must attach not less than two good and sufficient lines, cables, or hawsers to the bollards or other fixtures provided for the purpose to check the speed of the vessel and to stop it as soon as it has gone far enough to permit the lock gate behind it to be closed, and each line, cable, or hawser shall be attended on board while passing into the lock by one or more of the vessel's crew. Where vessels are so long that in order to get them wholly within the lock it is necessary to approach within 150 feet of the lock gate ahead, the speed of the vessel must be slow and fully under control by the lines, cables, or hawsers. Steam vessels of more than 100 tons gross, not including towboats, will not be permitted to turn their propellers on entering the lock after the bow of the vessel has entered, but will be drawn in by means of capstans on the lock walls or otherwise, and their speed must be checked and the vessel stopped by lines, cables, or hawsers as in other cases. All steam vessels may leave the lock under their own power. The master or person in charge of a vessel shall arrange to have any line, cable, or hawser handed or thrown from the lock walls by the superintendent or his assistants, made fast on the vessel as requested or directed, so that in cases of emergency such line, cable, or hawser may also be used to check the speed of and stop the vessel.

    (h) When a vessel is in position in the lock it shall be securely fastened in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent, or his assistant in charge of the lock at the time, to prevent the vessel from moving about while the lock is being filled or emptied, and the lines, cables, and hawsers used for this purpose shall be attended as far as is necessary or required while the filling or emptying is in progress.

    (i) No vessel which has iron or irons projecting from it or lumber or other cargo projecting over its sides shall enter the lock, except at such time and with such precautions to prevent damage to the lock or its appurtenances as the superintendent, or the assistant in charge of the lock at the time, may require.

    (j) All persons, whether in charge of vessels or not, are prohibited from willfully or carelessly damaging the lock, any of its appurtenances or the grounds adjacent thereto, and from throwing any material of any kind into the lock. No line shall be attached to anything except the bollards and other fixtures provided for the purpose.

    (k) Upon each passage through the lock, the master or clerk of a vessel shall make a statement of the kind and tonnage of the freight carried.

    (l) No person shall cause or permit any vessel or boat of which he is in charge to remain in the lock or its approaches for a longer time than is necessary for the passage of the lock, unless he is especially permitted to do so by the superintendent or the assistant in charge of the lock at the time, and if such vessel or boat is, in the opinion of such superintendent or assistant, in a position to obstruct navigation it shall be removed at once as requested or directed by such superintendent or assistant.

    (m) All registered merchant vessels shall pass through the lock in the order directed by the superintendent or the assistant in charge of the lock at the time. Unregistered craft will not be allowed to pass through the lock separately unless especially permitted by such superintendent or assistant.

    (n) The lock shall be operated promptly for the passage of all vessels upon signal excepting only in such cases as are specifically provided for in this section.

    § 207.20   Cape Cod Canal, Mass.; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.20

    (a)  The canal, including approaches, extends from the Canal Station Minus 100 in Cape Cod Bay, approximately one and six-tenths (1.6) statute miles seaward of the Canal Breakwater Light, through dredged channels and land cuts to Cleveland Ledge Light in Buzzards Bay approximately four (4) statute miles southwest of Wings Neck.

    (b)  (1) The movement of ships, boats and craft of every description through the canal and the operation and maintenance of the waterway and all property of the United States pertaining thereto shall be under the supervision of the Division Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer Division, New England, Corps of Engineers, Waltham, Massachusetts, or the authorized representative of the division engineer, the Engineer-In-Charge of the Cape Cod Canal. The division engineer or the Engineer-In-Charge from time to time will prescribe rules governing the dimensions of vessels which may transit the waterway, and other special conditions and requirements which will govern the movement of vessels using the waterway.

    (2) The Engineer-In-Charge, through the marine traffic controller on duty, will enforce these regulations and monitor traffic through the canal. The marine traffic controller on duty is the individual responsible for interpretation of these regulations with respect to vessels transiting the canal. Vessels transiting the canal must obey the orders of the marine traffic controller.

    (3) The government has tugs stationed at the West Boat Basin for emergency use on an on-call basis. A patrol vessel is manned and operational 24-hours a day.

    (c)  There is a marine traffic controller on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the traffic control center located at the Canal Administrative Office. The primary method of communications between the canal and vessels transiting will be by VHF-FM Marine radio. The traffic controller can also be contacted by telephone.

    (1) For radio communications, call the traffic controller on channel 16 to establish contact. The transmissions will then be switched to channel 12 or 14 as the working channel to pass information. Channel 13 is also available at the canal office; however, the use of channel 13 should be limited to emergency situations or whenever vessels do not have one of the other channels. All four channels are monitored continuously by the traffic controller. Radio discipline will be adhered to in accordance with FCC rules and regulations.

    (2) For telephone communications with the traffic controller, call (617) 759-4431.

    (3) Vessels shall maintain a radio guard on Marine VHF-FM channel 13 during the entire passage through the canal.

    (4) All radio communications in the vicinity of the canal are tape recorded for future reference.

    (d)  The canal is open for passage to all adequately powered vessels properly equipped and seaworthy, of sizes consistent with safe navigation as governed by the controlling depths and widths of the channel and the vertical and horizontal clearances of the bridges over the waterway. The granting of permission for any vessel to proceed through the waterway shall not relieve the owners, agents and operators of full responsibility for its safe passage. No vessel having a greater draft forward than aft will be allowed to transit the canal. Craft of low power and wind driven are required to have and use auxiliary power during passage throughout the canal as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Low powered vessels will be required to await slack water or favorable current for canal transit.

    (e)  (1) Tows shall be made-up outside the canal entrances. All vessels engaged in towing other vessels not equipped with a rudder shall use two lines or a bridle and one tow line. If the vessel in tow is equipped with a rudder or a ship shaped bow, one tow line may be used. All tow lines of hawsers must be hauled as short as practicable for safe handling of the tows. No towboat will be allowed to enter the waterway with more than two barges in tow unless prior approval is granted by the Engineer-In-Charge; requests must be submitted 12 hours in advance of the passage.

    (2) The maximum length of pontoon rafts using the canal will be limited to 600 feet, and the maximum width to 100 feet. Pontoon rafts exceeding 200 feet in length will be required to have an additional tug on the stern to insure that the tow is kept in line. The tugs used must have sufficient power to handle the raft safely.

    (3) Dead ships are required to transit the canal during daylight hours and must be provided with the number of tugs sufficient to afford safe passage through the canal. (A dead ship will not be allowed to enter the canal unless prior approval is granted by the Engineer-In-Charge; requests must be submitted 12 hours in advance of the passage).

    (f)  The master or pilot of any vessel or tow carrying dangerous cargoes must notify the Marine Traffic Controller prior to entering the canal. Dangerous cargoes are defined as those items listed in 33 CFR 126.10 when carried in bulk (, quantities exceeding 110 U.S. gallons in one tank) plus Class A explosives (commercial or military) as listed in 49 CFR 173.53 (commercial) and 46 CFR 146.29-100 (military), liquified natural gas and liquified petroleum gas. Transportation of dangerous cargoes through the canal shall be in strict accordance with existing regulations prescribed by law. In addition, vessels carrying dangerous cargoes shall comply with the following requirements.

    (1) They must have sufficient horsepower to overcome tidal currents or they will be required to wait for favorable current conditions.

    (2) Transits will be during daylight hours.

    (3) No transit will be permitted when visibility conditions are unstable or less than 2 miles at the approaches and throughout the entire length of the canal.

    (4) Transits must await a clear canal for passage.

    (g)  (1) Vessels under 65 feet in length may enter the canal without obtaining clearance. All craft are required to make a complete passage through the canal except excursion craft which may operate and change direction within the canal in accordance with procedures coordinated with the marine traffic controller on duty. When the railroad bridge span is in the closed (down) position, all vessels are directed not to proceed beyond the points designated by stop signs posted east and west of the railroad bridge. Vessels proceeding with a fair tide (with the current) should turn and stem the current at the designated stop points until the railroad bridge is in the raised (open) position.

    (2) Vessels 65 feet in length and over shall not enter the canal until clearance has been obtained from the marine traffic controller by radio. See paragraph (c) “Communications” for procedures. If a vessel, granted prior clearance, is delayed or stops at the mooring basins, state pier, or the Sandwich bulkhead, a second clearance must be obtained prior to continuing passage through the canal.

    (3) Vessels will be given clearance in the order of arrival, except when conditions warrant one-way traffic, or for any reason an order of priority is necessary, clearance will be granted in the following order.

    (i) First—To vessels owned or operated by the United States, including contractors' equipment employed on canal maintenance or improvement work.

    (ii) Second—To passenger vessels.

    (iii) Third—To tankers and barges docking and undocking at the Canal Electric Terminal.

    (iv) Fourth—To merchant vessels, towboats, commercial fishing vessels, pleasure boats and miscellaneous craft.

    (4) Procedures in adverse weather: Vessels carrying flammable or combustible cargoes as defined in 46 CFR 30.25 will be restricted from passage through the canal when visibility is less than   mile. Other vessels may transit the canal in thick weather by use of radar with the understanding that the U.S. Government will assume no responsibility:  That clearance has been obtained from the marine traffic controller.

    (h)  There are three sets of traffic lights showing red, green, and yellow that are operated on a continuous basis at the canal. The traffic lights apply to all vessels 65 feet in length and over. The traffic lights are a secondary system that is operated in support of the radio communications system. The traffic lights are located at the easterly canal entrance, Sandwich, and at the westerly entrance to Hog Island Channel at Wings Neck. A third traffic light is located at the Canal Electric Terminal basin on the south side of the canal in Sandwich, and applies only to vessels arriving and departing that terminal.

    (1)  When the green light is on at the eastern (Cape Cod Bay) entrance, vessels may proceed westward through the canal. When the red light is on, any type of vessel 65 feet in length and over must stop clear of the Cape Cod Bay entrance channel. When the yellow light is on, vessels 65 feet in length and over and drawing less than 25 feet may proceed as far as the East Mooring Basin where they must stop. Prior to continuing passage through the canal, clearance must be obtained from the marine traffic controller.

    (2)  When the green light is on at Wings Neck, vessels may proceed eastward through the canal. When the red light is on, vessels 65 feet and over in length and drawing less than 25 feet must keep southerly of Hog Island Channel Entrance Buoys Nos. 1 and 2 and utilize the general anchorage areas adjacent to the improved channel. Vessel traffic drawing 25 feet and over are directed not to enter the canal channel at the Cleveland Ledge Light entrance and shall lay to or anchor in the vicinity of Buzzards Bay Buoy No. 11 (FLW & Bell) until clearance is granted by the canal marine traffic controller or a green traffic light at Wings Neck is displayed. When the yellow light is on, vessels may proceed through Hog Island Channel as far as the West Mooring Basin where they must stop. Prior to continuing passage through the canal, clearance must be obtained from the marine traffic controller.

    (i)  The following signals at the Buzzards Bay Railroad Bridge will be given strict attention.

    (1) The vertical lift span on the railroad bridge is normally kept in the raised (open) position except when it is lowered for the passage of trains, or for maintenance purposes. Immediately preceding the lowering of the span, the operator will sound two long blasts of an air horn. Immediately preceding the raising of the span, the operator will sound one long blast of an air horn. When a vessel or craft of any type is approaching the bridge with the span in the down (closed) position and the span cannot be raised immediately, the operator of the bridge will so indicate by sounding danger signals of four short blasts in quick succession.

    (2) When the lift span is in the down (closed) position in foggy weather or when visibility is obscured by vapor, there will be four short blasts sounded from the bridge every two minutes.

    (j)  All vessels are directed to pass mooring and boat basin facilities, the state pier, and all floating plant engaged in maintenance operations of the waterway at a minimum speed consistent with safe navigation. In order to coordinate scheduled rail traffic with the passage of vessels, to minimize erosion of the canal banks and dikes from excessive wave wash and suction, and for the safety of vessels using the canal, the following speed regulations must be observed by vessels of all types, including pleasure craft. The minimum running time for the land cut between the East Mooring Basin (Station 35) and the Administration Office in Buzzards Bay (Station 388) is prescribed as follows:

    (k)  (1) Vessels within the limits of the canal shall comply with applicable navigation rules.

    (2) Vessels within the limits of the canal shall comply with the applicable requirements for the use of pilots established by the Coast Guard, including but not limited to those contained in 46 CFR 157.20-40. Vessels will not be granted clearance to enter the canal until the marine traffic controller has been notified of the name of the pilot who will be handling the vessel.

    (3) The master of a vessel will be responsible for notifying the marine traffic controller as soon as an emergency situation appears to be developing. When in the opinion of the marine traffic controller an emergency exists, he/she can require the master to accept the assistance of a helper vessel. Whether or not assistance is provided by a government vessel or by a private firm under contract to the government, the government reserves the right to seek compensation from the vessel owners for all costs incurred.

    (4) Right-of-Way: All vessels proceeding with the current shall have the right-of-way over those proceeding against the current. All craft up to 65 feet in length shall be operated so as not to interfere with the navigation of vessels of greater length.

    (5) Passing of vessels: The passing of one vessel by another when proceeding in the same direction is prohibited except when a leading low powered ship is unable to make sufficient headway. However, extreme caution must be observed to avoid collision, and consideration must be given to the size of the ship to be overtaken, velocity of current and wind, and atmospheric conditions. Masters of vessels involved shall inform the marine traffic controller on duty of developing situations to facilitate coordination of vessel movement. Meeting or passing of vessels at the easterly end of the canal between Station Minus 40 and Station 60 will not be permitted, except in cases of extreme emergency, in order to allow vessels to utilize the center line range to minimize the effects of hazardous eddies and currents. Due to bank suction and tidal set, meeting and passing of vessels at the following locations will be avoided:

    (i) Sagamore Bridge.

    (ii) Bourne Bridge.

    (iii) Railroad Bridge.

    (iv) Mass Maritime Academy.

    (6) Unnecessary delay in canal: Vessels and other type crafts must not obstruct navigation by unnecessarily idling at low speed when entering or passing through the canal.

    (7) Stopping in the waterway: Anchoring in the Cape Cod Canal Channel is prohibited except in emergencies. For the safety of canal operations it is mandatory that the masters of all vessels anchoring in or adjacent to the canal channel (Cape Cod Bay to Cleveland Ledge Light) for any reason, immediately notify the marine traffic controller.

    (8) Utilization of mooring and boat basins and the Sandwich Bulkhead: Vessels mooring or anchoring in the mooring or boat basins at the Sandwich bulkhead must do so in a manner not to obstruct or impede vessel movements to and from facilities. These facilities are of limited capacity and permission to occupy them for periods exceeding 24 hours must be obtained in advance from the marine traffic controller. Mooring in the West Boat Basin at Buzzards Bay, near the railroad bridge, is not permitted except in an emergency. Fishing boats, yachts, cabin cruisers and other craft utilizing the East Boat Basin on the south side of the canal at Sandwich, Massachusetts are not permitted to tie up at the Corps of Engineers landing float or anchor in a manner to prevent canal floating plant from having ready access to the float. All vessels or barges left unattended must be securely tied with adequate lines or cables. The United States assumes no liability for damages which may be sustained by any craft using the bulkhead at Sandwich or the canal mooring or boat basin facilities. Vessels shall not be left unattended along the face of the government bulkhead. A responsible person with authority to authorize and/or accomplish vessel movement must remain onboard at all times.

    (l)  In the event a vessel is grounded, or so damaged by accident as to render it likely to become an obstruction and/or hazard to navigation in the waterway, the division engineer or the division engineer's authorized representative shall supervise and direct all operations that may be necessary to remove the vessel to a safe locality.

    (m) [Reserved]

    (n)  No oil or other allied liquids, ashes, or materials of any kind shall be thrown, pumped or swept into the canal or its approaches from any vessel or craft using the waterway, nor shall any refuse be deposited on canal grounds, marine structures, or facilities.

    (o)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (q) of this section trespass upon the canal property is prohibited.

    (p)  The government owns, operates and maintains all bridges across the canal which include one railroad bridge and two highway bridges. The division engineer or his/her authorized representative may establish rules and regulations governing the use of these bridges.

    § 207.50   Hudson River Lock at Troy, N.Y.; navigation.

#### § § 207.50

    (a)  The lockmaster shall be charged with the immediate control and management of the lock, and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. He shall see that all laws, rules and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area are duly complied with, to which end he is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith, both to employees of the Government and to any and every person within the limits of the lock or lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel, boat, or other floating thing in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the lockmaster or his assistants.

    (b)  Steamboats or tows desiring lockage in either direction shall give notice to the lock tenders, when not more than three-fourths mile from the lock, by one long blast of (10 seconds' duration), followed by one short blast (of three seconds' duration), or a whistle or horn. When the lock is ready for entrance a green light will be shown from the river wall. An amber light will indicate that the lock is being made ready for entrance. A red light will indicate that the approaching vessel must wait. Whenever local conditions make it advisable the visual signals will be supplemented by sound signals as follows:

    (1) One long blast of a horn to indicate that the vessel must wait.

    (2) One short blast of a horn to indicate that the lock is being made ready for entrance.

    (3) Two short blasts of a horn to indicate permission to enter the lock.

    (4) Four short and rapid blasts to attract attention, indicate caution, and signal danger.

    (c)  Deep-draft boats must clear the miter sills by at least 3 inches. Boats drawing too much water will not be allowed to lighter cargo in the entrances.

    (d)  The vessel arriving first at the lock shall be first to lock through; but precedence shall be given to vessels belonging to the United States and to commercial vessels in the order named. Arrival posts or markers may be established ashore above or below the lock. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be considered as having arrived at the lock within the meaning of this paragraph. If the traffic is crowded in both directions; up and down lockages will usually be made alternately, but the lock tender may permit two or more lockages to be made at one time in the same direction when this will not cause unreasonable delay. In case two or more boats or tows are to enter for the same lockage, they shall enter as directed by the lock tender. No boat shall run ahead of another while in the lock. The boat that enters first shall leave first.

    (e)  The lockage of pleasure boats, house boats or like craft shall be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than barges carrying gasoline or highly hazardous materials) in order to utilize the capacity of the lock to its maximum. Lockage of pleasure craft may be made with commercial craft carrying petroleum products other than gasoline, provided a clear distance of at least 100 feet between such vessels can be maintained in the lock. If, after the arrival of such craft, no separate or combined lockage can be accomplished within a reasonable time, not to exceed the time required for three other lockages, then separate lockage shall be made.

    (f)  Boats waiting their turn to enter the lock must lie at a sufficient distance from the lock and in such a position as to leave sufficient room for the passage of boats leaving the lock.

    (g)  (1) Boats must not cause delay in entering or leaving the lock. Masters and pilots will be held to a strict accountability in this matter, and those with tows must provide enough men to move barges promptly. Boats failing to enter the lock with reasonable promptness after being signaled will lose their turn.

    (2) Tugboats arriving with their tows in a condition which will delay locking shall lose their turn if so ordered by the lock tender. Leaking boats may be excluded until put in shape to be passed through safely.

    (h)  Boats in the lock or waiting in the entrance shall be moored where directed by the lock tender, by bow, stern, and spring lines, to the snubbing posts or line hooks. Tying boats to the lock ladders is strictly prohibited.

    (i)  Boats will not be permitted to enter or leave the lock until the lock gates are at rest in the gate recesses and the lock tender has directed the boat to start.

    (j)  All craft passing through the lock must be free from projections or sharp corners which might scar the walls or injure other parts. Steamboats must be provided with suitable fenders, etc. One man shall be kept at the head of every tow till it has cleared the lock and guide walls, and shall use the fender to prevent scarring the walls.

    (k)  None but employees of the United States will be allowed to move any valve, gate, or other machinery belonging to the lock.

    (l)  Throwing ashes, refuse, or other obstruction in the entrances or in the lock, or on the walls thereof, and passing coal from flats or barges to a steamboat while in the lock is prohibited.

    (m) [Reserved]

    (n)  Trespass on U.S. property, or willful injury to the banks, masonry, fences, trees, houses, machinery, or other property of the United States at or near the lock is strictly prohibited.

    (o)  In addition to the penalties prescribed by law, boats which fail to comply with the regulations in this section will thereafter be refused lockage until assurances have been received, satisfactory to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, New York, New York, that the regulations will be complied with.

    (a)  The regulations in this section are applicable to that part of the inland waterway from Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Del. and Md., between Reedy Point, Delaware River, and Old Town Point Wharf, Elk River.

    (b)  The District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia, Pa., has administrative supervision over the waterway and is charged with the enforcement of these regulations. The District Engineer from time to time will prescribe rules governing the dimensions of vessels which may transit the waterway, and other special conditions and requirements which will govern the movement of vessels using the waterway. The District Engineer's representative is the Chesapeake City Resident Engineer. The Chesapeake City Resident Engineer through the dispatcher on duty will enforce these regulations and monitor traffic through the canal.

    (c)  Clearance for any vessel to enter or pass through any part of the waterway will be contingent on the vessel's having adequate personnel, machinery, and operative devices for safe navigation. In the event of question as to the ability of any vessel to navigate the waterway safely, a ruling will be made by the dispatcher. The owner, agent, master, pilot, or other person in charge of the vessel concerned may appeal the dispatcher's ruling to the District Engineer whose decision shall be final. A clearance by the dispatcher for a vessel's passage through the waterway shall not relieve the owners, agents, and operators of the vessel of full responsibility for its safe passage.

    (d)  Requirements for radio equipment on vessels transiting the waterway are as described in rules governing traffic through the waterway issued by the District Engineer. Vessels not having the mandatory radio equipment will not be permitted to transit the canal.

    (e)  The anchorage basin at Chesapeake City and free wharfage facilities on the west side of the anchorage basin are available for small vessels only. These facilities are of limited capacity, and permission to occupy them for periods exceeding 24 hours must be obtained in advance from the dispatcher at Chesapeake City.

    (f)  No vessel carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects beyond the sides of the vessel will be permitted to enter or pass through the waterway. Vessels carrying rods, poles, or other gear extending above the top of the vessel's mast will be required to lower such equipment to a level with the top of the mast before entering the waterway.

    (g) [Reserved]

    (h) —(1)  The maximum overall length and extreme breadth of this type of tow which may transit the canal are as described in rules governing traffic through the waterway issued by the District Engineer.

    (2)  All ships or tugs engaged in towing vessels not equipped with a rudder, whether light or loaded, shall use two towlines or a bridle on one towline. If the vessel in tow is equipped with a rudder, one towline without a bridle may be used. All towlines must be hauled as short as practicable for safe handling of the tows. No towboat will be permitted to enter the waterway with more than two loaded, or three light barges. Two or more barges or other vessels, not self-propelled, shall be towed abreast and not in tandem, using two towlines unless the towboat is made fast alongside the tow.

    (i) [Reserved]

    (j)  Traffic lights are located at Reedy Point and Old Town Point Wharf. These traffic lights are described in the rules governing traffic through the waterway issued by the District Engineer.

    (k)  Operation of the Penn Central vertical lift bridge across the canal will be in accordance with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Coast Guard, § 117.235a  of this chapter.

    (l) [Reserved]

    (m)  The depositing of trash, refuse, debris, oil, or other material in the waterway or upon the banks or right-of-way is prohibited. Violators are subject to penalties as prescribed by Federal law.

    (p)  In the event a vessel is grounded or wrecked in the waterway or is damaged by accident or successive mechanical breakdown, the owner, agent, or operator shall take prompt action to prevent the vessel from becoming or remaining an obstruction to navigation, and such persons shall also respond to such instructions as may be issued by the District Engineer to prevent the vessel from becoming or remaining a menace to navigation. The lack of reasonable response from owner, agent, or operator may be deemed sufficient cause for the District Engineer to undertake repair or removal of the vessel as he may determine to be in the best interest to the Government.

    (q)-(s) [Reserved]

    (t)  Any pilot who pilots in the canal shall comply with State laws or Coast Guard regulations and must be licensed for this waterway by the U.S. Coast Guard.

    (u)  Vessels which are observed by the pilot or master in charge, to be difficult to handle, or which are known to have handled badly on previous trips, must transit the canal during daylight hours and must have tug assistance. Such vessels must obtain permission from the dispatcher to enter the canal and must be provided with the number of tugs sufficient to afford safe passage.

    (f) [Reserved]

    (g)  (1) Rafts will be permitted to navigate a waterway only if properly and securely assembled. The passage of “bag” or “sack” rafts, “dog” rafts, or of loose logs over any portion of a waterway, is prohibited. Each section of a raft will be secured within itself in such a manner as to prevent the sinking of any log, and so fastened or tied with chains or wire rope that it cannot be separated or bag out so as to materially change its shape. All dogs, chains and other means used in assembling rafts shall be in good condition and of ample size and strength to accomplish their purposes.

    (2) No section of a raft will be permitted to be towed over any portion of a waterway unless the logs float sufficiently high in the water to make it evident that the section will not sink en route.

    (3) Frequent inspections will be made by the person in charge of each raft to insure that all fastenings remain secure, and when any one is found to have loosened, it shall be repaired at once. Should any log or section be lost from a raft, the fact must be promptly reported to the District Engineer, giving as definitely as possible the exact point at which the loss occurred. In all cases the owner of the lost log or section will take steps immediately to remove the same from the waterway.

    (4) The length and width of rafts shall not exceed such maximum dimensions as may be prescribed by the District Engineer.

    (5) All rafts shall carry sufficient men to enable them to be managed properly, and to keep them from being an obstruction to other craft using the waterway. To permit safe passage in a narrow channel rafts will, if necessary, stop and tie up alongside the bank. Care must be exercised both in towing and mooring rafts to avoid the possibility of damage to aids to navigation maintained by the United States or under its authorization.

    (6) When rafts are left for any reason with no one in attendance, they must be securely tied at each end and at as many intermediate points as may be necessary to keep the timbers from bagging into the stream, and must be moored so as to conform to the shape of the bank. Rafts moored to the bank shall have lights at 500-foot intervals along their entire length. Rafts must not be moored at prominent projections of the bank, or at critical sections.

    (7) Logs may be stored in certain tributary streams provided a clear channel at least one-half the width of the channel be left clear for navigation along the tributary. Such storage spaces must be protected by booms and, if necessary to maintain an open channel, piling should also be used. Authority for placing these booms and piling must be obtained by written permit from the District Engineer.

    (8) The building, assembling, or breaking up of a raft in a waterway will be permitted only upon special authority obtained from the District Engineer, and under such conditions as he may prescribe.

    (h)  Attention is invited to the provisions of sections 13 and 20 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152, 1154; 33 U. S. C. 407, 415), and of sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Oil Pollution Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 604, 605; 33 U.S.C. 432-434), which prohibit the depositing of any refuse matter in these waterways or along their banks where liable to be washed into the waters; authorize the immediate removal or destruction of any sunken vessel, craft, raft, or other similar obstruction, which stops or endangers navigation; and prohibit the discharge of oil from vessels into the coastal navigable waters of the United States.

    (i)  Masters and owners of vessels using the waterways are responsible for any damage caused by their operations to canal revetments, lock piers and walls, bridges, hurricane gate chambers, spillways, or approaches thereto, or other Government structures, and for displacing or damaging of buoys, stakes, spars, range lights or other aids to navigation. Should any part of a revetment, lock, bridge, hurricane gate chamber, spillway or approach thereto, be damaged, they shall report the fact, and furnish a clear statement of how the damage occurred, to the nearest Government lockmaster or bridge tender, and by mail to the District Engineer, U.S. Engineer Office, in local charge of the waterway in which the damage occurred. Should any aid to navigation be damaged, they shall report that fact immediately to the Superintendent of Lighthouses at Norfolk, Virginia, if north of New River Inlet, North Carolina; to the Superintendent of Lighthouses at Charleston, South Carolina, if between New River Inlet, North Carolina, and St. Lucie Inlet, Florida; to the Superintendent of Lighthouses at Key West, Florida, if between St. Lucie Inlet and Suwanee River, Florida; and to the Superintendent of Lighthouses, New Orleans, Louisiana, if between Suwanee River and St. Marks, Florida.

    (j)  Trespass on waterway property or injury to the banks, locks, bridges, piers, fences, trees, houses, shops or any other property of the United States pertaining to the waterway is strictly prohibited. No business, trading or landing of freight or baggage will be allowed on or over Government piers, bridges, or lock walls.

    (k)  Copies of the regulations in this section will be furnished free of charge upon application to the nearest District Engineer.

    § 207.180   All waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico (except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South and Southwest Passes and the Atchafalaya River) from St. Marks, Fla., to the Rio Grande; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.180

    (a) The regulations in this section shall apply to:

    (1)  All navigable waters of the U.S. tributary to or connected by other waterways with the Gulf of Mexico between St. Marks, Fla., and the Rio Grande, Tex. (both inclusive), and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway; except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South and Southwest Passes, and the Atchafalaya River above its junction with the Morgan City-Port Allen Route.

    (2)  All locks, floodgates, and appurtenant structures in the waterways described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (3)  All bridges, wharves, and other structures in or over these waterways.

    (4)  The term “vessels” as used in this section includes all floating craft other than rafts.

    (5)  The term “raft” as used in this section includes any and all types of assemblages of floating logs or timber fastened together for support or conveyance.

    (b)  The use, administration, and navigation of the waterways and structures to which this section applies shall be under the direction of the officers of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, in charge of the respective districts, and their authorized assistants. The location of these Engineer Districts, and the limits of their jurisdiction, are as follows:

    (1)  The St. Marks River, Fla., to the Pearl River, Mississippi and Louisiana; and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from Apalachee Bay, Fla., to mile 36.4 east of Harvey Lock.

    (2)  The Pearl River and its tributaries, Mississippi and Louisiana.

    (3)  From Pearl River, Mississippi and Louisiana, to Sabine River, Louisiana and Texas; and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from mile 36.4 east of Harvey Lock, to mile 266 west of Harvey Lock.

    (4)  The Sabine River, Louisiana and Texas, to the Rio Grande, Tex.; and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from mile 266 west of Harvey Lock, to Brownsville, Tex.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d)  (1) The term “lock” as used in this section shall include locks, floodgates, and appurtenant structures, and the area designated as the lock area including the lock approach channels.

    (2)  The term “lockmaster” as used in this section means the official in charge of operating a lock or floodgate. The lockmaster is responsible for the immediate management and control of the lock and lock area and for the enforcement of all laws, rules, and regulations for the use of the lock. He is authorized to give all necessary and appropriate orders and instructions to every person in the lock area, whether navigating the lock or not; and no one shall cause any movement of any vessel within the lock area unless instructed to do so by the lockmaster or his duly authorized assistants. The lockmaster may refuse passage through the lock to any vessel which, in his judgment, fails to comply with the regulations of this section.

    (3)  Vessels desiring passage through a lock shall notify the lockmaster by three long and distinct blasts of a horn, whistle, or calls through a megaphone, when within a reasonable distance from the lock. When the lock is ready for entrance, the lockmaster shall reply with three long blasts of a horn, whistle, or calls through a megaphone. When the lock is not ready for entrance, the lockmaster shall reply by four or more short, distinct blasts of a horn, whistle, or calls through a megaphone (danger signal). Permission to leave the lock shall be indicated by the lockmaster by one long blast.

    (4)  Signal lights and discs shall be displayed at all locks as follows:

    (i)  One green light shall indicate the lock is open to approaching navigation; one red light shall indicate the lock is closed to approaching navigation.

    (ii)  Large discs, identical in color and number to the light signals prescribed in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section will be displayed from a mast on or near the lock wall.

    (5)  Locks will monitor continuously VHF—Channel 14 (“Safety and Calling” Channel) and/or AM-2738 kHz for initial communication with vessels. Upon arrival at a lock, a vessel equipped with radio-phone will immediately advise the lock by radio of its arrival so that the vessel may be placed on proper turn. Information transmitted or received in these communications shall in no way affect the requirements for use of sound signals or display of visual signals, as provided in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section.

    (6)  The order of precedence for locking is:

    (i) U.S. Government vessels, passenger vessels, commercial vessels, rafts, and pleasure craft.

    (ii) The vessel arriving first at a lock will be locked through first. When vessels approach simultaneously from opposite directions, the vessel approaching at the same elevation as the water in the lock chamber will be locked through first. In order to achieve the most efficient utilization of the lock, the lockmaster is authorized to depart from the normal order of locking precedence, stated in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, as in his judgment is warranted.

    (iii) The lockage of pleasure boats, houseboats, or like craft may be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than vessels carrying dangerous cargoes, as described in 46 CFR part 146). If, after the arrival of such craft, no combined lockage can be made within reasonable time, not to exceed three other lockages, then separate lockage shall be made.

    (7)  No vessel or tow shall enter or exit from a lock before being signaled to do so. While awaiting turn, vessels or tows must not obstruct navigation and must remain at a safe distance from the lock, taking position to the rear of any vessel or tows that precede them; and rearranging the tow for locking in sections, if necessary. Masters and pilots of vessels or tows shall enter or exit from a lock with reasonable promptness after receiving the proper signal. Appropriate action will be taken to insure that the lock approaches are not obstructed by sections of a tow either awaiting lockage or already locked through. Masters of vessels shall provide sufficient men to assist in the locking operation when deemed necessary by the lockmaster. Care shall be taken to insure prompt and safe passage of the vessel without damage to the structure.

    (8)  Vessels or tows shall enter and exit from locks under sufficient control to prevent damage to the lock, gates, guide walls, fenders, or other parts of the structure. Vessels shall be equipped with and use suitable fenders and adequate lines to protect the lock and to insure safe mooring during the locking operation. Vessels shall not meet or pass anywhere between the gate walls or fender system or in the approaches to locks.

    (9)  The following vessels shall not be permitted to enter locks or approach channels:

    (i) Vessels in a sinking condition.

    (ii) Vessels leaking or spilling cargo.

    (iii) Vessels not having a draft of at least three (3) inches less than the depth over the sills or breast walls.

    (iv) Vessels having projection or cargo loaded in such a manner that is liable to damage the structure.

    (v) Vessels having chains, links, or drags either hanging over the sides or ends or dragging on the bottom for steering or other purposes.

    (vi) Vessels containing flammable or dangerous cargo must have the hatch covers in place and securely fastened.

    (10)  Tows locking in sections will generally be allowed only two consecutive lockages if other vessels are waiting for lockage unless otherwise decided by the lockmaster. If other tows are waiting above and below a lock, lockages will be made both ways alternately whenever practicable.

    (11)  (i) When in a lock, vessels and tows shall be moored where directed by the lockmaster by bow, stern, and spring lines to the snubbing posts or hooks provided for that purpose, and lines shall not be let go until the signal is given for the vessel to exit. Tying to the lock ladders is prohibited.

    (ii) Mooring near the approaches to locks is prohibited except when the vessels or tows are awaiting lockage.

    (12)  Vessels and tows using the locks may be required to furnish personnel to assist in locking through; however, the operation of the structure is the responsibility of the lockmaster, and personnel assisting in the lockage of the vessels and tows will follow the direction of the appropriate official on duty at the lock. No gates, valves or other accessories or controls will be operated unless under his direction.

    (13) [Reserved]

    (14)  Rafts shall be locked through as directed by the lockmaster. No raft will be locked that is not constructed in accordance with the requirements stated in paragraph (f) of this section. The person in charge of a raft desiring lockage shall register with the lockmaster immediately upon arriving at the lock and receive instructions for locking.

    (e)  (1)-(5)(i) [Reserved]

    (ii) Algiers Canal between the Mississippi River and Bayou Barataria, La., and on Harvey Canal, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 0 to mile 6 WHL, tows 74 feet in width will be allowed. Tows in excess of 55 feet wide desiring to move over Algiers Canal or Harvey Canal will obtain clearance from the lockmaster at Algiers Lock or Harvey Lock, respectively, before entering the canal. Overwidth tows will report clearing Algiers or Harvey Canal to the respective lockmaster and will rearrange tows to conform to prescribed dimensions immediately upon leaving the canal. The lockmaster will withhold permission for additional tows over 55 feet wide until all previously authorized tows moving in the opposite direction have cleared the waterway.

    (iii)-(vi) [Reserved]

    (vii) Vessels or tows shall not navigate through a drawbridge until the movable span is fully opened.

    (6)  Vessels or tows carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects over the side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other property, shall not enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway without prior approval of the District Engineer.

    (7)  Passing vessels shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Federal Rules of the Road. At certain intersections where strong currents may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued through navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the intersection.

    (f)  The navigation regulations in this paragraph shall apply fully to the movement of rafts.

    (1) Rafts will be permitted to navigate a waterway only if properly and securely assembled. Each raft shall be so secured as to prevent the loss or sinking of logs.

    (2) All rafts shall carry sufficient men to enable them to be managed properly. It will be the responsibility of the owner to remove logs from the waterway that have broken loose from the raft.

    (3) Building, assembling, or breaking up of a raft within a waterway may be permitted; however, the work must be done in an area that will not restrict the use of the waterway by other users. The work area must be cleared of loose logs so that they will not enter the waterway and become a hazard to navigation.

    (g)  Should any damage be done to a revetment, lock, floodgates, bridge, or other federally owned or operated structure, the master of the vessel shall report the accident to the nearest lockmaster or bridgetender as soon as possible after the accident. Damage to aids to navigation and to nonfederally owned bridges must be reported to the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, New Orleans, La.

    (h)  Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other persons using the waterways covered by this section shall report to the District Engineer at the earliest possible date any accident on the waterway which causes any vessel to become an obstruction to navigation. The information to be furnished the District Engineer shall include the name of the vessel, its location, and the name and address of the owner. The owner of a sunken vessel shall properly mark the vessel as soon as practicable after sinking.

    (i)  (1) Trespass on or injury to waterway property of the United States is prohibited. No business, trading, or landing of freight, will be allowed on Government property without permission of the District Engineer.

    (2) The District Engineer may establish policy pertaining to mooring, exchanging crews, loading and unloading supplies, and making emergency repairs in the vicinity of locks so long as navigation is not impeded thereby.

    (j)  The regulations of this section will not affect the liability of the owners and operators of vessels for any damage caused by their operations to the waterway or to the structures therein.

    § 207.187   Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Tex.; special floodgate, lock and navigation regulations.

#### § § 207.187

    (a)  The regulations in this section shall apply to the operation of the Brazos River Floodgates and the Colorado River Locks at Mile 400.8 and Mile 441.5, respectively, west of Harvey Lock, La., on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and navigation of the tributary Colorado River Channel in the vicinity of said locks.

    (b)  The term  means the velocity of flow of water in the river. It is expressed in statute miles per hour. The term “head differential” means the difference measured in feet between the water level in the river and that in the waterway when the floodgates or lock gates are closed. The term “Lockmaster” means the official in charge of the floodgates or locks.

    (c) —(1)  The floodgates and locks shall be opened for the passage of single vessels and towboats with single or multiple barges when the current in the river is less than 2 miles per hour and the head differential is less than 0.7 foot. When the head differential is less than 0.7, the Colorado River locks shall normally be operated as floodgates, using only the riverside gates of each lock.

    (2)  When the current in either river exceeds 2 miles per hour or the head differential at the Brazos River floodgates is between the limits of 0.7 foot and 1.8 feet, both inclusive, or the head differential at the Colorado River locks is 0.7 foot or greater, passage shall be afforded only for single vessels or towboats with single loaded barges or two empty barges. When two barges are rigidly assembled abreast of each other and the combined width of both together is 55 feet or less, they shall be considered as one barge. Each section of an integrated barge shall be considered as one barge, except when it is necessary to attach a rake section to a single box section to facilitate passage, the two sections shall be considered as one barge. It shall be the responsibility of the master, pilot or other person in charge of a vessel to determine whether a safe passage can be effected, give due consideration to the vessel's power and maneuverability, and prevailing current velocity, head differential, weather and visibility. If conditions are not favorable, passage shall be delayed until conditions improve and a safe crossing is assured.

    (3)  The Brazos River Floodgates shall be closed to navigation when the head differential exceeds 1.8 feet. The Colorado River Locks shall be closed to navigation when the current in the river exceeds a critical velocity as determined by the District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District, Galveston, Tex. The Brazos River Floodgates or the Colorado River Locks shall be closed to navigation when in the opinion of said District Engineer it is required for the protection of life and property, or it is to the advantage of the Government to permit uninterrupted emergency or maintenance operations, including dredging.

    (4)  Mooring facilities located on both banks of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway on the approaches to the floodgates and locks are for the mooring of vessels when the floodgates or locks are closed to navigation or tows are limited to single barges. Vessels awaiting passage shall be moored parallel to the bank and as close to the bank as possible. Barges shall be moored fore and aft with two lines, each to a separate mooring facility. Beaching of vessels in lieu of mooring them is prohibited. The mooring facilities are numbered and vessels making fast to them shall notify the Lockmaster giving the number of each facility being used.

    (5) [Reserved]

    (6) —(i)  The floodgates and locks are equipped with short wave radio equipment transmitting and receiving on VHF—FM Channels 12, 13, 14 and 16. Call letters for the floodgates are WUI 411 and for the locks are WUI 412.

    (ii)  The floodgates and locks are equipped with telephone facilities. The floodgates may be reached by phoning Freeport, Tx, 713-233-1251; the locks may be reached by phoning Matagorda, Tx, 713-863-7842.

    (7)  Arrival posts 10 feet high and 10 inches in diameter have been established on the approaches to the locks and floodgates. They are painted with alternate horizontal bands of red and white 3 inches wide. Arrival at the floodgates or locks shall be determined as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of § 207.180.

    (d) —(1)  (i) Light and sound signals directed both upstream and downstream on the Colorado River are mounted on top of a galvanized skeleton steel tower 85 feet high located on the northeast point of land at the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway crossing of the river. They will be operated from the control house of the East Lock of the Colorado River Locks to direct the interchange of traffic in the Colorado River and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

    (ii) Vessels navigating the Colorado River and desiring passage either upstream or downstream through the crossing, or into the crossing and through a lock into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, shall give notice to the Lockmaster by two long and distinct blasts of a whistle or horn when within a distance of not more than one-half mile nor less than one-fourth mile from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway crossing. When the locks and the crossing are clear of vessels, the Lockmaster shall reply by two long and distinct blasts of a whistle or horn and display a green light from the signal tower indicating that the vessel in the river may proceed across the crossing or into the main stem of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway either eastbound or westbound. When there are vessels in the river crossing or in the locks, the Lockmaster shall reply by four or more short blasts of a whistle or horn (danger signal) and display a red light from the signal tower indicating the vessel in the river shall wait at least a quarter of a mile from the crossing for clearance. When the locks and crossing are clear of vessels, the lockmaster shall indicate to the waiting vessel by two long and distinct blasts of a whistle or horn and display of a green light from the signal tower indicating that the vessel may proceed across the crossing or into the main stem of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway either eastbound or westbound. During periods when the red light may be obscured by fog, mist, or rain, an audible signal consisting of a long blast followed by a short blast of a whistle or horn, repeated every 30 seconds, shall be sounded from the signal tower as an adjunct to the red light.

    (2)  Large signs with silver reflective background and stop sign red letters are erected one-fourth mile upstream and downstream from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway on the Colorado River. The legend states “DO NOT PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT WHEN SIGNAL TOWER LIGHT IS RED.” These signs must be obeyed.

    § 207.200   Mississippi River below mouth of Ohio River, including South and Southwest Passes; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.200

    (a)  Except in case of great emergency, no vessel or craft shall anchor over revetted banks of the river, and no floating plant other than launches and similar small craft shall land against banks protected by revetment except at regular commercial landings. In all cases, every precaution to avoid damage to the revetment works shall be exercised. The construction of log rafts along mattressed or paved banks or the tying up and landing of log rafts against such banks shall be performed in such a manner as to cause no damage to the mattress work or bank paving. Generally, mattress work extends out into the river 600 feet from the low water line. Information as to the location of revetted areas may be obtained from, and will be published from time to time by, the District Engineers, Corps of Engineers, New Orleans, Louisiana, Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, and the President, Mississippi River Commission, Vicksburg, Mississippi.

    (b) —(1)  The use, administration, and navigation of the waterways to which this paragraph applies shall be under the supervision of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, New Orleans, Louisiana.

    (2)-(3) [Reserved]

    (4)  Any cable or pipeline crossing or extending into the waterways shall be marked by large signs with 12-inch black letters on a white background readable from the waterway side, placed on each side of the river near the point where the cable or pipeline enters the water, and at a sufficient height to be readable above any obstructions normally to be expected at the locality such as weeds or moored vessels.

    (5)  Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other persons using the waterway to which this paragraph applies shall notify the District Engineer by the most expeditious means available of all marine accidents, such as fire, collision, sinking, or stranding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel or interference with navigation or where damage to Government property is involved, furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and ownership of the vessel or vessels involved, the time and place, and the action taken. In all cases, the owner of the sunken vessel shall take immediate steps properly to mark the wreck.

#### § § 207.249

    (a) [Reserved]

    (b) —(1)  (i)  The lockmaster shall be charged with the immediate control and management of the lock and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. He shall insure that all laws, rules, and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area are duly complied with, to which end he is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith both to employees of the Government and to any and every person within the limits of the lock or lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel or other floating thing in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the lockmaster or his assistants. For the purpose of the regulations in this section, the “lock area” is considered to extend from the downstream to the upstream arrival posts.

    (ii)  Contract lock operators shall give all necessary orders and direction for operation of the locks. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel or other floating object in the locks or approaches except by or under the direction of the contract lock operator. All duties and responsibilities of the lockmasters set forth in this section shall be performed by the contract lock operator except that the responsibility for enforcing all laws, rules and regulations shall be vested in an offsite government employee designated by the Vicksburg District Engineer.

    (2)  (i) Vessels desiring passage through a lock in either direction shall give notice to the lockmaster by one long and one short distinct blast of a horn or whistle when not less than three-fourths mile from the lock. When carrying dangerous cargo, the signal will be one long and two short blasts of the horn or whistle. When the lock is ready for entrance, the lockmaster shall reply with one long blast of a horn or whistle. When the lock is not ready for entrance, the lockmaster shall reply by four or more short, distinct blasts of a horn or whistle (danger signal). Permission to leave the lock shall be indicated by the lockmaster by one short blast. A distinct blast is defined as a clearly audible blast of any length. A long blast means a blast of from 4 to 6 seconds' duration. A short blast is of about 1 second's duration.

    (ii) Vessels that are not equipped with a sound signal desiring passage through a lock shall give notice to the lockmaster by one long blast of the horn located at either end of the lock wall. The horn may be activated by pulling the properly marked chain or rope hanging from the horn down to the water surface. One long blast means a blast of from 4 to 6 seconds' duration.

    (3)  Signal lights will be displayed outside each lock gate to supplement the sound signals, as follows:

    (i) One green light to indicate that the lock is open to approaching navigation.

    (ii) One red light to indicate that the lock is not open to approaching navigation. Vessels shall stand clear.

    (iii) Navigation over the dam is possible during high water. When this condition exists, a continuous flashing red light, visible upstream and downstream, will be displayed to indicate that traffic will bypass the lock and pass over the dam on the Ouachita and Black Rivers.

    (iv)  When water levels rise to within 2 feet of the top of the lock walls, operation of the locks will cease until the water level falls below this level. These stages can reasonably be expected to occur once in 10 years. No vessel, tow, or raft shall attempt to navigate over the lock or other structures at high river stages. United States Coast Guard radiotelephone broadcasts and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers navigation bulletins should be monitored for information on lock operations.

    (4)  Two-way radio equipment is provided at all locks. The “Safety and Calling” channel (Channel 16, frequency of 156.8 mhz), will be monitored at all times for initial communication with vessels. Information transmitted or received in these communications shall in no way affect the requirements for the use of sound signals or display of visual signals as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.

    (5)  (i) The vessel arriving first at a lock will be first to lock through. In the case of vessels approaching the lock simultaneously from opposite directions, the vessel approaching at the same elevation as the water in the lock chamber will be locked through first. Precedence shall be given to vessels belonging to the United States, passenger vessels, commercial vessels, rafts, and pleasure craft, in the order named. Arrival posts or markers will be established ashore above and below the locks. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be considered as having arrived at the lock within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(5). The lockmaster may prescribe such departure from the normal order of precedence stated above, as in his judgment, is warranted under prevailing circumstances to achieve best lock utilization.

    (ii) The lockage of pleasure boats, houseboats, or like craft may be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than barges carrying dangerous cargoes). If, after the arrival of such craft, no combined lockage can be accomplished within a reasonable time, not to exceed the time required for three other lockages, then separate lockages shall be made. Dangerous cargoes are described in 46 CFR part 146.

    (iii) Vessels, tows, or rafts navigating on the Ouachita and Black Rivers with overall dimensions greater than 80 feet wide, 600 feet long, and 9 feet draft, or tows or rafts requiring breaking into two or more sections to pass through the lock may transit the lock at such time as the lockmaster determines that they will neither unduly delay the transit of craft of lesser dimensions, nor endanger the lock structure and appurtenances because of wind, current, or other adverse conditions. These craft are also subject to such special handling requirements as the lockmaster finds necessary at the time of transit.

    (iv) The maximum dimensions on the Red River Waterway of a vessel tow attempting to pass through the lock during normal pool stages in a single passage are 80 feet wide, 705 feet long, and 9 feet draft. Tows requiring breaking into two or more sections to pass through the lock may transit the lock at such times as the lockmaster/lock operator determines that they will neither unduly delay the transit of craft of lesser dimensions, nor endanger the lock structure and appurtenances because of wind, current, or other adverse conditions. These craft are also subject to such special handling requirements as the lockmaster/lock operator finds necessary at the time of transit.

    (6)  No vessel or raft shall enter or leave locks before being signaled to do so. While waiting their turn, vessels or rafts must not obstruct navigation and must remain at a safe distance from locks. Before entering a lock they shall take position in the rear of any vessels or rafts that precede them, and there arrange the tow for locking in sections if necessary. Masters and pilots of vessels or persons in charge of rafts shall cause no undue delay in entering or leaving locks upon receiving the proper signal. They shall take such action as will insure that the approaches are not at any time unnecessarily obstructed by parts of a tow awaiting lockage or already passed through. They shall provide sufficient men to move through locks promptly without damage to the structures. Vessels or tows shall enter locks with reasonable promptness after being signaled to do so.

    (7)  (i) Vessels shall enter and leave locks under such control as to prevent any damage to the locks, gates, guide walls, guard walls, and fenders. Vessels shall be provided with suitable lines and fenders, shall always use fenders to protect the walls and gates, and when locking at night shall be provided with suitable lights and use them as directed. Fenders on vessels shall be water-soaked or otherwise fire proofed before being utilized in the lock or approaches. Vessels shall not meet or pass each other anywhere between the guide walls or fender system at the approaches to locks.

    (ii) Vessels which do not have a draft of at least 2 feet less than the depth over sills, or which have projections liable to damage gates, walls, or fenders, shall not enter the approaches to or pass through locks. Information concerning depth over sills may be obtained from the lockman on duty.

    (iii) Vessels having chains, lines, or drags either hanging over the sides or ends or dragging on the bottom for steering or other purposes will not be permitted to pass locks or dams.

    (iv) Towing vessels shall accompany all tows or partial tows through locks.

    (v) No vessel whose cargo projects beyond its sides will be admitted to lockage.

    (vi) Vessels in a sinking condition shall not enter locks or approaches.

    (vii) The lockmaster may refuse to lock vessels which in his judgment fail to comply with the regulations in this paragraph.

    (viii) This section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of boats for any damage caused by their operations to locks or other structures.

    (8)  Tows or rafts locking in sections will generally be allowed only two consecutive lockages if individual vessels are waiting for lockage, but may be allowed more in special cases. If tows or rafts are waiting above and below a lock for lockage, sections will be locked both ways alternately whenever practicable. When two or more tows or rafts are waiting lockage in the same direction, no part of one shall pass the lock until the whole of the one preceding it shall have passed.

    (9)  (i) Vessels and rafts when in a lock shall be moored where directed by the lockmaster by bow, stern, and spring lines to the bitts provided for that purpose and lines shall not be let go until the signal is given for the vessel or raft to leave. Tying to the lock ladders is prohibited.

    (ii) The mooring of vessels or rafts near the approaches to locks except while waiting for lockage, or at other places in the pools where such mooring interfers with general navigation, is prohibited.

    (10)  The lock gates, valves, and accessories will be moved only under the direction of the lockmaster; but, if required, all vessels and rafts using the locks shall furnish ample help on the lock walls for handling lines under the direction of the lockmaster.

    (c)  Trespass on lock grounds or other waterway property or injury to the banks, lock entrances, locks, cribs, dams, piers, fences, trees, buildings, or any other property of the United States pertaining to the waterway is strictly prohibited. No landing of freight, passengers, or baggage will be allowed on or over Government piers, lock walls, guide or guard walls, except by permission of the lockmaster. No person except employees of the United States or persons assisting with the locking operations under the direction of the lockmaster will be allowed on the dam, lock walls, guide walls, guard walls, abutments, or appurtenant structures.

    (d)  A copy of the regulations in this section shall be kept at all times on board each vessel regularly navigating the waterways to which the regulations in this section apply. Copies may be obtained free of charge at any of the locks or from the Vicksburg District Engineer, Vicksburg, Mississippi, upon request.

    § 207.260   Yazoo Diversion Canal, Vicksburg, Miss., from its mouth at Kleinston Landing to Fisher Street; navigation.

#### § § 207.260

    (a)  Vessels navigating the canal will be governed by the Pilot Rules for Western Rivers (rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries) prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard. (See part 95 of this title.)

    (b)  Rafts will be permitted to navigate the canal only if properly and securely assembled. Each section of a raft shall be so secured within itself as to prevent the sinking of any log, and so fastened with chains or wire rope that it cannot be separated or bag out or materially change its shape. All logs, chains, and other means used in assembling rafts shall be in good condition and of ample size and strength to accomplish their purpose. No section of a raft will be permitted to be towed unless the logs float sufficiently high in the water to make it evident that the section will not sink en route. Rafts shall not be of greater dimensions than 50 feet wide by 600 feet long, and if longer than 300 feet they shall be handled by two tugs; and in all cases they must be handled by sufficient tug power to make headway and guide the raft so as to give half the channel to passing vessels.

    (c)  At stages below 20 feet on the Vicksburg Gage, no vessel or raft shall be moored along the west bank of the canal between points Latitude 32°21′16″, Longitude 90°53′05″ and Latitude 32°20′55″, Longitude 90°53′18″, which is approximately 1200 feet above and 1200 feet below the public boat launch (foot of Clay Street) at Vicksburg City Front. No vessel or raft shall be moored along the west bank of the canal at any stage from the mouth of the Yazoo Diversion Canal where it enters into the Mississippi River to Latitude 32°20′21″, Longitude 90°53′44″, which is approximately 1200 feet from the mouth of the canal. No vessel or raft shall be moored along the east bank of the canal at any stage from the mouth of the Yazoo Diversion Canal where it enters into the Mississippi River to Latitude 32°20′12″, Longitude 90°53′41″, which is approximately 750 feet from the mouth of the canal. When tied up, boats, barges, or rafts shall be moored by bow and stern lines parallel to the bank and as close in as practicable. Lines shall be secured at sufficiently close intervals to insure the vessel or raft will not be drawn away from the bank by winds, current, or other passing vessels. No vessel or raft shall be moored along the banks of the canal for a period longer than five (5) calendar days without written permission from the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District Office, 4155 E. Clay St., Vicksburg, Mississippi 39180-3435.

    (d) [Reserved]

    (e)  No person shall roll or throw any stones, ashes, cinders, barrels, logs, log butts, sawdust, shavings, refuse, or any other material into the canal or the approach thereto, or place any such material on the bank or berm so that it is liable to be rolled, thrown, or washed into the canal.

    (f)  Masters and pilots of all craft using the canal shall avoid damaging any revetment, dike, floodwall, or other work of improvement placed in or adjacent to the canal. They shall not disturb any gages or marks set as aids to navigation in the canal or approaches thereto.

    (g)  A clear channel not less than 175 feet wide as established by the District Engineer shall be left open at all times to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels.

    § 207.270   Tallahatchie River, Miss., between Batesville and the mouth; logging.

#### § § 207.270

    (a) The floating of “sack”, rafts, or of loose timbers, logs, or cribs is prohibited.

    (b) Rafts shall be made up of logs parallel with each other, secured, and held closely together by cross sticks, chains, or cables placed across each crib and at the joints between cribs. No raft shall be over 60 feet wide or 800 feet long.

    (c) In rafting nonbuoyant timber each crib must contain self-buoyant logs in such proportion of “floaters” to “sinkers” as will safely float the whole; and in assembling such cribs, extra strong connections must be used to prevent the breaking up of a crib or the detachment of individual logs.

    (d) No raft shall be moved at river stages less than that corresponding to a reading of 3  feet on the U.S. Weather Bureau gage at Greenwood, Miss.

    (e) A raft in transit must be accompanied by sufficient men, or by power boats of sufficient capacity to properly manage the movement of the raft and to keep it from being an obstruction to other craft navigating the river, or from forming jams at bridges.

    (f) Rafts in transit must be so floated, and when not in transit be so tied to the bank, as not to interfere with the passage of boats.

    (g) When rafts are left with no one in attendance they must be securely tied at each end and at as many intermediate points as will prevent them from bagging into the stream. When left at night a white light shall be exposed at each end of the raft.

    (h) This section shall apply to the portion of the Tallahatchie River, Miss., between Batesville, Panola County, Miss., and the mouth.

    § 207.275   McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River navigation system: use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.275

    (a)  These regulations apply to all locks and appurtenant structures, wharves, and other Corps of Engineers structures in the following waterways: The White River between Mississippi River and Arkansas Post Canal, Arkansas; Arkansas Post Canal, Arkansas; Arkansas River between Dam No. 2, Arkansas, and Verdigris River, Oklahoma; Verdigris River between Arkansas River and Catoosa, Oklahoma; and reservoirs on these waterways between Mississippi River, Arkansas, and Catoosa, Oklahoma.

    (b)  The use, administration, and navigation of the structures to which this section applies shall be under the direction of the officers of the Army Corps of Engineers, detailed in charge of the respective districts, and their authorized assistants. The cities in which these district engineers are located, and the limits of their jurisdictions, are as follows:

    (1)  From Mississippi River, Arkansas, to Arkansas-Oklahoma State line at Fort Smith, Arkansas.

    (2)  From Arkansas-Oklahoma State line at Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Catoosa, Oklahoma.

    (c)  The lockmaster shall be charge with the immediate control and management of the lock and of the area set aside as the lock area. The lockmaster shall ensure that all laws, rules, and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area are duly complied with, to which end he/she is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions both to employees of the Government and to any person within the limits of the lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel or other floating thing in the lock area except by or under the direction of the lockmaster. Failure to comply with directions given by the lockmaster pursuant to the regulations in this section may result in refusal of lockage. For the purpose of the regulations in this section, the “lock area” is considered to be between the upstream and downstream arrival points. The district engineer may extend the limits of the lock area consistent with the safe and efficient use of the waterway.

    (d)  (1) Precedence shall be given to vessels owned by the United States, licensed commercial passenger vessels operating on a published schedule or regularly operating in the “for hire” trade, commercial tows, rafts, and pleasure craft, in the order named. Precedence being equal, the first vessel to arrive at a lock will normally be the first to lock through; however, the lockmaster may depart from this procedure to achieve optimum utilization of the lock or in accordance with the order of precedence stated above and in paragraphs (d)(2) and (h) of this section. Arrival points have been established ashore upstream and downstream of the locks. Vessels arriving at these markers or the mooring cells immediately upstream and downstream of the lock will be considered as having arrived at the lock within the meaning of this subparagraph.

    (2) Vessels or tows, with overall dimensions greater than 105 feet wide or 595 feet long may transit the lock at such time as the lockmaster determines that they will neither unduly delay the transit of craft of lesser dimensions, nor endanger the lock structure and appurtenances because of wind, current, or other adverse conditions. These craft are also subject to such special handling requirements as the lockmaster deems necessary at the time of transit.

    (e)  (1) Leaking vessels may be excluded from the locks.

    (2) Smoking, open flames, and activities capable of producing a flammable atmosphere such as painting will not be permitted in the lock chamber.

    (3) All deckhands handling lines during locking procedures shall wear a personal flotation device.

    (f)  The following rules are prescribed for all tows containing dangerous cargoes as defined in Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations. These rules are applicable to both loaded barges and empty barges.

    (1) All hatches on barges used to transport dangerous cargoes shall be closed before the tow enters the lock area.

    (2) Prior to entering the lock area, towboat pilots shall furnish the name of product, the source of shipment, the company which made the shipment, and the consignee. If a towboat is not equipped with a radio or its radio is out of service, pilots shall furnish this information to the lockmaster while the tow is in the lock chamber. The shipping papers required by title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be available for review by the lockmaster. Lockage shall be refused when this information is not furnished to the lockmaster.

    (3) Fenders shall be water-soaked or otherwise spark proofed.

    (4) Smoking, open flames, chipping, or other spark producing activity are prohibited in the “lock area.”

    (5) Simultaneous lockage of other vessels with vessels carrying dangerous cargoes or containing flammable vapors shall normally not be permitted. if significant delays are occurring at a lock, such simultaneous lockages, except with pleasure craft, may be permitted by the lockmaster, when he/she determines such action safe and appropriate, provided:

    (i) The first vessel entering or the last vessel exiting shall be secured before the other enters or leaves.

    (ii) All masters involved have agreed to the joint use of the lock.

    (g)  (1) In case two or more boats or tows are to enter for the same lockage, their order of entry and exit shall be determined by the lockmaster.

    (2) Tows entering a lock shall come to a complete stop at a point designated by the district engineer before proceeding to the mooring position.

    (3) When entering or exiting locks, tow speeds shall not exceed 200 feet per minute (rate of slow walk) or the rate of travel whereby the tow can be stopped by checking should mechanical difficulties develop. When navigating over Norrell Dam during high water, vessels shall reduce speed to the minimum necessary to maintain steerageway. Pilots should check with the individual lockmasters concerning prevailing conditions. It is also recommended that pilots check their ability to reverse their engines prior to beginning an approach. Towboat engines shall not be turned off in the lock unless authorized by lockmaster.

    (4) The sides and ends of all vessels passing through any lock shall be free from protrusions of any kind which might damage the lock structure.

    (5) All vessels shall be provided with suitable fenders. When entering and exiting locks, one deckhand, or more if the lockmaster so directs, shall be stationed at the bow and stern of tows. These deckhands shall maintain their stations while tows are moving adjacent to any part of a lock. They shall protect the lock walls by the use of hand-held fenders. In all cases, two deckhands shall be stationed at the bows of tows 100 feet wide or wider when entering locks. They shall remain at their stations until the bows of such tows pass the recessed miter gates.

    (6) Masters and pilots must use every precaution to prevent unnecessary delay in entering or leaving locks. Vessels failing to enter locks with reasonable promptness when signaled to do so shall lose their turn. Rearranging or switching of barges in the locks or in approaches is prohibited unless approved or directed by the lockmaster.

    (7) No vessel shall enter a lock unless its draft is at least two feet less than the least depth of water over the sills. Information concerning controlling depth over sills can be obtained from the lockmaster at each lock or by inquiry at the office of the district engineer of the district in which the lock is located.

    (8) Vessels awaiting their turn to lock shall be positioned so that they will not interfere with vessels leaving the lock. However, to the extent practicable under the prevailing conditions, vessels and tows shall be positioned so as to minimize approach time.

    (9)  (i) Tows or rafts locking in sections will generally be allowed only two consecutive lockages if other vessels are waiting lockage, but may be allowed more in special cases. No part of a tow shall pass a lock until the whole of the one preceding it shall have passed. The lockmaster may prescribe a departure from the normal order of precedence to achieve the best lock utilization.

    (ii) One deckhand, or more if the lockmaster so directs, shall tend the lines at the bow and stern of each section of a tow that transits a lock or moors to the river walls.

    (10) Vessels shall enter and leave locks under such control as to prevent any damage to the walls and gates.

    (11) Placing or discharging refuse of any description into the lock, on the lock walls, on the esplanade, or on any other government property is prohibited.

    (h)  In order to fully utilize the capacity of the lock, lockmasters may expedite the lockage of pleasure craft by locking them through with commercial vessels, except vessels carrying volatile cargoes or other substances likely to emit toxic, flammable, or explosive vapors. If the lockage of pleasure craft cannot be accomplished within the time required for three single lockages, a separate lockage of pleasure craft shall be made. Pleasure craft operators are advised that the locks have a pull chain located at the end of each river wall which signals the lockmaster that lockage is desired.

    (i)  While awaiting lockage, rafts and tows containing floating dredge discharge line shall not obstruct the lock approaches. They shall be properly and securely assembled to assure adequate control while entering and exiting locks. The passage of loose logs through a lock is prohibited. Lockage will be refused to rafts unless the logs float sufficiently high to make it evident that the raft will not sink.

    (j) —(1)  (i) When in the locks, all vessels shall be moored as directed by the lockmaster. Vessels shall be moored with bow and stern lines leading in opposite directions to prevent the vessel from “running” in the lock. All vessels will have one additional line available on the head of the tow for emergency use. The pilot of a vessel shall remain at his station in the pilot house and the deckhands shall stand by the mooring lines during the entire locking procedure. When the vessel is securely moored, the pilot shall not cause movement of the propeller except in an emergency or unless directed by the lockmaster. Tying to lock ladders is strictly prohibited.

    (ii) Mooring of any vessel will not be permitted at or between the arrival points without permission of the lockmaster.

    (2)  (i) Vessels over 40 feet in length shall not land or anchor against revetted banks without written permission of the district engineer, except in case of emergency. When an emergency landing is necessary, adjacent locks shall be notified. In all cases, every precaution to avoid damage to the revetment works shall be exercised. The construction of log rafts along mattressed or paved banks or the tying up and landing of log rafts against such banks require the permission of the district engineer.

    (ii) Government mooring facilities at the junction of main stem and secondary channels are to provide temporary mooring for tows awaiting transfer of barges to or from ports, docks, or fleeting areas located on the secondary channels. These facilities shall not be used for storage of barges or fleeting activities. The maximum permissible time of mooring at the facilities shall be determined by the district engineer.

    (k)  Vessels must approach the locks with caution and not enter or leave the locks until signaled to do so by the lockmaster.

    (1)  Requests for lockage by radio will be the primary signal for vessels equipped with VHF-FM radios operating in the FCC authorized Maritime Band. District engineers will advise all known interested parties of the channels available for use in communicating with the locks. Pilots of commercial tows should contact the locks at least one-half hour before arrival in order that they may be informed of current river and traffic conditions that may affect the safe passage of their tows.

    (2)  In addition to radio communication, the following sound signals are prescribed for use during lockage. Sound signals given by vessels and locks shall be given by means of a horn. The term prolonged blast means a blast of from four to six second's duration. The term short blast means a blast of about one second's duration.

    (i) Vessels desiring a single lockage shall give notice to the lockmaster by one prolonged blast of the horn followed by one short blast. If a double lockage is required, vessels shall give one prolonged blast of the horn followed by two short blasts. These signals are not required from pleasure craft not equipped with horns. Locking procedures for pleasure craft are prescribed in paragraph (h).

    (ii) When the lock is ready for entrance, the lockmaster shall give one prolonged blast of the horn to signal permission to enter the lock chamber.

    (iii) The lockmaster shall give permission to leave the lock chamber by one short blast of the horn.

    (iv) Five or more short and rapid blasts of the lock horn will be used as a means of attracting attention, to indicate caution, or to signal danger. This signal will be used to attract the attention of the masters and crews of vessels using the lock or navigating in the lock area and to indicate that something unusual involving danger or requiring special caution is happening or is about to happen. When this signal is given by the lockmaster, the masters and crews of vessels in the vicinity shall immediately become alert to determine the reason for the signal and shall take the necessary steps to cope with the situation.

    (3)  Signal lights are displayed outside each lock gate to supplement the radio and sound signals. Vessels will be governed as follows:

    (i) One flashing green light to indicate that the lock is open to approaching navigation.

    (ii) One flashing red light to indicate that the lock is not open to approaching navigation. Vessels shall stand clear.

    (iii) Flashing amber and green lights to indicate that one or both lock gates can not be fully recessed or other unusual conditions exist. Vessels can enter the lock with caution.

    (iv) In the absence of any of the above visual signals, pilots shall signal for lockage by radio or horn and wait for the lockmaster to acknowledge their signal.

    (l)  (1) The following navigation lights will be displayed at all locks except Norrell Lock and Lock No. 2 during hours of darkness and heavy fog.

    (i) Three green lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the upstream river wall.

    (ii) Two green lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the downstream river wall.

    (iii) A single red light visible through an arc of 360 degrees on the ends of the upstream and downstream land walls.

    (2) The following navigation lights will be displayed at Lock No. 2 during hours of darkness and heavy fog. They shall also be displayed at Norrell Lock during hours of darkness and heavy fog except when navigation is passing over the dam.

    (i) Three green lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the upstream river wall.

    (ii) Two green lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the downstream river wall.

    (iii) A single red light visible through an arc of 360 degrees on the dolphin located furthest upstream in line with the land wall and on the dolphin located furthest downstream in line with the land wall.

    (3) The following navigation lights will be displayed at Norrell Lock and Dam during hours of darkness and heavy fog when navigation is passing over the dam. During daylight hours a yellow and black disc will be displayed on each end (upstream and downstream) of the river wall to signal navigation over the dam.

    (i) Three red lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the upstream river wall.

    (ii) Two red lights visible through an arc of 360 degrees arranged in a vertical line on the end of the downstream river wall.

    (iii) A single red light visible through an arc of 360 degrees on the dolphin located furthest upstream in line with the land wall and on the dolphin located furthest downstream in line with the land wall.

    (iv) A single, flashing blue light visible through an arc of 360 degrees located on the end of the dam opposite the lock.

    (m)  All waters immediately above and below each dam, as posted by the respective district engineers, are hereby designated as restricted areas. No vessel or other floating craft shall enter any such restricted area without permission of the lockmaster. The limits of the restricted areas at each dam will be determined by the responsible district engineer and marked by signs installed in conspicuous and appropriate locations.

    (n)  (1) Trespass on locks or dams or other United States property pertaining to the locks or dams is strictly prohibited except in those areas specifically permitted by the lockmaster. Any person committing a willful injury to any United States property or personnel will be prosecuted.

    (2) No fishing will be permitted from the lock or dam structures.

    (3) No one but employees of the United States shall move any lock machinery unless directed by the lockmaster. Tampering or meddling with the machinery or other parts of the lock is strictly forbidden.

    (o)  To avoid damage to plant and structures connected with the construction or repair of locks and dams, vessels passing structures in the process of construction or repair shall reduce their speed and navigate with special caution while in the vicinity of such work.

    (p)  In furtherance of maintaining navigation safety the following rules are prescribed for all navigation interests:

    (1) Any incident resulting in uncontrolled barges shall immediately be reported to the nearest lock and the appropriate U.S. Coast Guard Office. The report shall include information as to the number of loose barges, their cargo, and the time and location where they broke loose. The lockmaster shall be kept informed of the progress being made in bringing the barges under control so that he/she can initiate whatever actions may be warranted.

    (2) Masters, owners, or other persons using the waterways to which the regulations in this section apply shall report to the nearest lockmaster or the district engineer by the most expeditious means available all marine accidents; such as fire, collision, sinking, or grounding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel or interference with navigation; furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and ownership of the vessel or vessels involved; the time and place; and the action taken. In all cases, the owner of a sunken vessel shall take immediate steps to mark the wreck properly.

    (i) Sunken or sinking barges shall be reported to the nearest lock both downstream and upstream of the location in order that traffic passing those points may be advised of the hazards. The appropriate U.S. Coast Guard Office shall also be notified.

    (ii) Whenever it is necessary to report an incident involving uncontrolled, sunken or sinking barges, the cargo in the barges shall be precisely identified.

    (iii) The owners or masters of vessels sunk in the navigable waters of the United States shall provide the appropriate district engineer with a copy of the sunken vessel report furnished to the appropriate U.S. Coast Guard Marine Inspection Office.

    (q) [Reserved]

    (r)  This section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of vessels for any damage caused by their operations. Should any Government property be damaged as the result of the operation of a vessel, the master of the vessel shall report the accident to the nearest lockmaster or the appropriate district engineer.

    (s)  If the owner or operator of any vessel persistently violates the regulations of this section or any orders given in pursuance thereof, after due notice of same, lockage may be refused by the district engineer. The lockmaster may refuse lockage if deemed necessary to protect government property in the vicinity of the lock.

    (t)  A copy of these regulations shall be kept at all times on board each commercial vessel engaged in navigating the waterway. Copies may be obtained from any lock or district engineer's office on request. Masters of such vessels are also required to have on board current copies of the navigation charts and applicable Notices to Navigation Interest.

    § 207.300   Ohio River, Mississippi River above Cairo, Ill., and their tributaries; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.300

    (a) —(1)  The provisions of this paragraph apply to all waterways in this section except for Cordell Hull Lock located at Mile 313.5 on the Cumberland River in Tennessee. The lockmaster shall be charged with the immediate control and management of the lock, and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. He/she shall see that all laws, rules, and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area are duly complied with, to which end he/she is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith, both to employees of the government and to any and every person within the limits of the lock and lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel, boat, or other floating thing in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the lockmaster or his/her assistants. In the event of an emergency, the lockmaster may depart from these regulations as he deems necessary. The lockmasters shall also be charged with the control and management of federally constructed mooring facilities.

    (2)  The provisions of this paragraph apply to Cordell Hull Lock located at Mile 313.5 on the Cumberland River in Tennessee. Contract personnel shall give all necessary orders and directions for operation of the lock. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel, boat or other floating thing in the locks or approaches except by or under the direction of the contract lock operator. All duties and responsibilities of the lockmaster set forth in this section shall be performed by the contract lock operator except that responsibility for enforcing all laws, rules, and regulations shall be vested in a government employee designated by the Nashville District Engineer. The district engineer will notify waterway users and the general public through appropriate notices and media concerning the location and identity of the designated government employee.

    (b)  The following safety rules are hereby prescribed for vessels in the locking process, including the act of approaching or departing a lock:

    (1)  (i) Stripping barges or transferring cargo is prohibited.

    (ii) All hatches on barges used to transport flammable or hazardous materials shall be closed and latched, except those barges carrying a gas-free certificate.

    (iii) Spark-proof protective rubbing fenders (“possums”) shall be used.

    (2)  (i) Leaking vessels may be excluded from locks until they have been repaired to the satisfaction of the lockmaster.

    (ii) Smoking, open flames, and chipping or other spark-producing activities are prohibited on deck during the locking cycle.

    (iii) Painting will not be permitted in the lock chamber during the locking cycle.

    (iv) Tow speeds shall be reduced to a rate of travel such that the tow can be stopped by checking should mechanical difficulties develop. Pilots should check with the individual lockmasters concerning prevailing conditions. It is also recommended that pilots check their ability to reverse their engines prior to beginning an approach. Engines shall not be turned off in the lock until the tow has stopped and been made fast.

    (v) U.S. Coast Guard regulations require all vessels to have on board life saving devices for prevention of drowning. All crew members of vessels required to carry work vests (life jackets) shall wear them during a lockage, except those persons in an area enclosed with a handrail or other device which would reasonably preclude the possibility of falling overboard. All deckhands handling lines during locking procedure shall wear a life jacket. Vessels not required by Coast Guard regulations to have work vests aboard shall have at least the prescribed life saving devices, located for ready access and use if needed. The lockmaster may refuse lockage to any vessel which fails to conform to the above.

    (c)  In furtherance of increased safety on waterways the following safety rules are hereby prescribed for all navigation interests:

    (1) Any incident resulting in uncontrolled barges shall immediately be reported to the nearest lock. The report shall include information as to the number of loose barges, their cargo, and the time and location where they broke loose. The lockmaster or locks shall be kept informed of the progress being made in bringing the barges under control so that he can initiate whatever actions may be warranted.

    (2) Whenever barges are temporarily moored at other than commercial terminals or established fleeting areas, and their breaking away could endanger a lock, the nearest lock shall be so notified, preferably the downstream lock.

    (3) Sunken or sinking barges shall be reported to the nearest lock both downstream and upstream of the location in order that other traffic passing those points may be advised of the hazards.

    (4) In the event of an oil spill, notify the nearest lock downstream, specifying the time and location of the incident, type of oil, amount of spill, and what recovery or controlling measures are being employed.

    (5) Any other activity on the waterways that could conceivably endanger navigation or a navigation structure shall be reported to the nearest lock.

    (6) Whenever it is necessary to report an incident involving uncontrolled, sunken or sinking barges, the cargo in the barges shall be accurately identified.

    (d)  (1) The vessel arriving first at a lock shall normally be first to lock through, but precedence shall be given to vessels belonging to the United States. Licensed commercial passenger vessels operating on a published schedule or regularly operating in the “for hire” trade shall have precedence over cargo tows and like craft. Commercial cargo tows shall have precedence over recreational craft, except as described in paragraph (f) of this section.

    (2) Arrival posts or markers may be established ashore above and/or below the locks. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be considered as having arrived at the locks within the meaning of this paragraph. Precedence may be established visually or by radio communication. The lockmaster may prescribe such departure from the normal order of precedence as in his judgment is warranted to achieve best lock utilization.

    (e)  Masters and pilots must use every precaution to prevent unnecessary delay in entering or leaving locks. Vessels failing to enter locks with reasonable promptness when signalled to do so shall lose their turn. Rearranging or switching of barges in the locks or in approaches is prohibited unless approved or directed by the lockmaster. This is not meant to curtail “jackknifing” or set-overs where normally practiced.

    (f)  In order to fully utilize the capacity of the lock, the lockage of recreational craft shall be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft:  That both parties agree to joint use of the chamber. When recreational craft are locked simultaneously with commercial tows, the lockmaster will direct, whenever practicable, that the recreational craft enter the lock and depart while the tow is secured in the lock. Recreational craft will not be locked through with vessels carrying volatile cargoes or other substances likely to emit toxic or explosive vapors. If the lockage of recreational craft cannot be accomplished within the time required for three other lockages, a separate lockage of recreational craft shall be made. Recreational craft operators are advised that many locks have a pull chain located at each end of the lock which signals the lockmaster that lockage is desired. Furthermore, many Mississippi River locks utilize a strobe light at the lock to signal recreational type vessels that the lock is ready for entry. Such lights are used exclusively to signal recreational craft.

    (g)  Simultaneous lockage of other tows with tows carrying dangerous cargoes or containing flammable vapors normally will only be permitted when there is agreement between the lockmaster and both vessel masters that the simultaneous lockage can be executed safely. He shall make a separate decision each time such action seems safe and appropriate, provided:

    (1) The first vessel or tow in and the last vessel or tow out are secured before the other enters or leaves.

    (2) Any vessel or tow carrying dangerous cargoes is not leaking.

    (3) All masters involved have agreed to the joint use of the lock chamber.

    (h)  Vessels awaiting their turn to lock shall remain sufficiently clear of the structure to allow unobstructed departure for the vessel leaving the lock. However, to the extent practicable under the prevailing conditions, vessels and tows shall position themselves so as to minimize approach time when signaled to do so.

    (i)  When navigable dams are up or are in the process of being raised or lowered, vessels desiring to use the pass shall wait outside the limits of the approach points unless authorized otherwise by the lockmaster.

    (j)  Signals from vessels shall ordinarily be by whistle; signals from locks to vessels shall be by whistle, another sound device, or visual means. when a whistle is used, long blasts of the whistle shall not exceed 10 seconds and short blasts of the whistle shall not exceed 3 seconds. Where a lock is not provided with a sound or visual signal installation, the lockmaster will indicate by voice or by the wave of a hand when the vessel may enter or leave the lock. Vessels must approach the locks with caution and shall not enter nor leave the lock until signaled to do so by the lockmaster. The following lockage signals are prescribed:

    (1)  These signals apply at either a single lock or twin locks.

    (i) Vessels desiring lockage shall on approaching a lock give the following signals at a distance of not more than one mile from the lock;

    () If _a_ single lockage only is required: One long blast of the whistle followed by one short blast.

    () If a dou_b_le lockage is required: One long blast of the whistle followed by two short blasts.

    (ii) When the lock is ready for entrance, the lock will give the following signals:

    () One long bl_a_st of the whistle indicates permission to enter the lock chamber in the case of a single lock or to enter the landward chamber in the case of twin locks.

    () Two long _b_lasts of the whistle indicates permission to enter the riverward chamber in the case of twin locks.

    (iii) Permission to leave the locks will be indicated by the following signals given by the lock:

    () One short bl_a_st of the whistle indicates permission to leave the lock chamber in the case of a single lock or to leave the landward chamber in the case of twin locks.

    () Two short _b_lasts of the whistle indicates permission to leave the riverward chamber in the case of twin locks.

    (iv) Four or more short blasts of the lock whistle delivered in rapid succession will be used as a means of attracting attention, to indicate caution, and to signal danger. This signal will be used to attract the attention of the captain and crews of vessels using or approaching the lock or navigating in its vicinity and to indicate that something unusual involving danger or requiring special caution is happening or is about to take place. When this signal is given by the lock, the captains and crews of vessels in the vicinity shall immediately become on the alert to determine the reason for the signal and shall take the necessary steps to cope with the situation.

    (2)  At locks where density of traffic or other local conditions make it advisable, the sound signals from the lock will be supplemented by signal lights. Flashing lights (showing a one-second flash followed by a two-second eclipse) will be located on or near each end of the land wall to control use of a single lock or of the landward lock of double locks. In addition, at double locks, interrupted flashing lights (showing a one-second flash, a one-second eclipse and a one-second flash, followed by a three-second eclipse) will be located on or near each end of the intermediate wall to control use of the riverward lock. Navigation will be governed as follows:

    (i)  Lock cannot be made ready immediately. Vessel shall stand clear.

    (ii)  Lock is being made ready. Vessel may approach but under full control.

    (iii)  Lock is ready for entrance.

    (iv)  Lock is ready for entrance but gates cannot be recessed completely. Vessel may enter under full control and with extreme caution.

    (3)  VHF-FM radios, operating in the FCC authorized Maritime Band, have been installed at all operational locks (except those on the Kentucky River and Lock 3, Green River). Radio contact may be made by any vessel desiring passage. Commercial tows are especially requested to make contact at least one half hour before arrival in order that the pilot may be informed of current river and traffic conditions that may affect the safe passage of his tow.

    (4) All locks monitor 156.8 MHz (Ch. 16) and 156.65 MHz (Ch. 13) and can work 156.65 MHz (Ch. 13) and 156.7 MHz (Ch. 14) Ch. 16 is the authorized call, reply and distress frequency, and locks are not permitted to work on this frequency except in an emergency involving the risk of immediate loss of life or property. Vessels may call and work Ch. 13, without switching, but are cautioned that vessel to lock traffic must not interrupt or delay Bridge to Bridge traffic which has priority at all times.

    (k)  Rafts to be locked through shall be moored in such manner as not to obstruct the entrance of the lock, and if to be locked in sections, shall be brought to the lock as directed by the lockmaster. After passing the lock the sections shall be reassembled at such distance beyond the lock as not to interfere with other vessels.

    (l)  In case two or more boats or tows are to enter for the same lockage, their order of entry shall be determined by the lockmaster. Except as directed by the lockmaster, no boat shall pass another in the lock. In no case will boats be permitted to enter or leave the locks until directed to do so by the lockmaster. The sides of all craft passing through any lock shall be free from projections of any kind which might injure the lock walls. All vessels shall be provided with suitable fenders, and shall be used to protect the lock and guide walls until it has cleared the lock and guide walls.

    (m) —(1)  (i) All vessels when in the locks shall be moored as directed by the lockmaster. Vessels shall be moored with bow and stern lines leading in opposite directions to prevent the vessel from “running” in the lock. All vessels will have one additional line available on the head of the tow for emergency use. The pilothouse shall be attended by qualified personnel during the entire locking procedure. When the vessel is securely moored, the pilot shall not cause movement of the propellers except in emergency or unless directed by the lockmaster. Tying to lock ladders is strictly prohibited.

    (ii) Mooring of unattended or nonpropelled vessels or small craft at the upper or lower channel approaches will not be permitted within 1200 feet of the lock.

    (2)  (i) No vessel or other craft shall regularly or permanently moor in any reach of a navigation channel. The approximate centerline of such channels are marked as the sailing line on Corps of Engineers' navigation charts. Nor shall any floating craft, except in an emergency, moor in any narrow or hazardous section of the waterway. Furthermore, all vessels or other craft are prohibited from regularly or permanently mooring in any section of navigable waterways which are congested with commercial facilities or traffic unless it is moored at facilities approved by the Secretary of the Army or his authorized representative. The limits of the congested areas shall be marked on Corps of Engineers' navigation charts. However, the District Engineer may authorize in writing exceptions to any of the above if, in his judgment, such mooring would not adversely affect navigation and anchorage.

    (ii) No vessel or other craft shall be moored to railroad tracks, to riverbanks in the vicinity of railroad tracks when such mooring threatens the safety of equipment using such tracks, to telephone poles or power poles, or to bridges or similar structures used by the public.

    (iii) Except in case of great emergency, no vessel or craft shall anchor over revetted banks of the river, and no floating plant other than launches and similar small craft shall land against banks protected by revetment except at regular commercial landings. In all cases, every precaution to avoid damage to the revetment works shall be exercised. The construction of log rafts along mattressed or paved banks or the tying up and landing of log rafts against such banks shall be performed in such a manner as to cause no damage to the mattress work or bank paving. Generally, mattress work extends out into the river 600 feet from the low water line.

    (iv) Any vessel utilizing a federally constructed mooring facility (e.g., cells, buoys, anchor rings) at the points designated on the current issue of the Corps' navigation charts shall advise the lockmaster at the nearest lock from that point by the most expeditious means.

    (n)  No vessel shall attempt to enter a lock unless its draft is at least three inches less than the least depth of water over the guard sills, or over the gate sills if there be no guard sills. Information concerning controlling depth over sills can be obtained from the lockmaster at each lock or by inquiry at the office of the district engineer of the district in which the lock is located.

    (o)  No one but employees of the United States shall move any lock machinery except as directed by the lockmaster. Tampering or meddling with the machinery or other parts of the lock is strictly forbidden.

    (p)  Placing or discharging refuse of any description into the lock, on lock walls or esplanade, canal or canal bank is prohibited.

    (q)  To avoid damage to plant and structures connected with the construction or repair of locks and dams, vessels passing structures in the process of construction or repair shall reduce their speed and navigate with special caution while in the vicinity of such work. The restrictions and admonitions contained in these regulations shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of floating craft for any damage to locks or other structures caused by the operation of such craft.

    (r)  Trespass on locks or dams or other U.S. property pertaining to the locks or dams is strictly prohibited except in those areas specifically permitted. Parties committing any injury to the locks or dams or to any part thereof will be responsible therefor. Any person committing a willful injury to any U.S. property will be prosecuted. No fishing will be permitted from lock walls, guide walls, or guard walls of any lock or from any dam, except in areas designated and posted by the responsible District Engineer as fishing areas. Personnel from commercial and recreational craft will be allowed on the lock structure for legitimate business reasons; e.g., crew changes, emergency phone calls, etc.

    (s)  All waters immediately above and below each dam, as posted by the respective District Engineers, are hereby designated as restricted areas. No vessel or other floating craft shall enter any such restricted area at any time. The limits of the restricted areas at each dam will be determined by the responsible District Engineer and market by signs and/or flashing red lights installed in conspicuous and appropriate places.

    (t) [Reserved]

    (u)  Vessels operating on these waters during periods when river stages exceed the level of “ordinary high water,” as designated on Corps of Engineers' navigation charts, shall exercise reasonable care to minimize the effects of their bow waves and propeller washes on river banks; submerged or partially submerged structures or habitations; terrestrial growth such as trees and bushes; and man-made amenities that may be present. Vessels shall operate carefully when passing close to levees and other flood protection works, and shall observe minimum distances from banks which may be prescribed from time to time in Notices to Navigation Interests. Pilots should exercise particular care not to direct propeller wash at river banks, levees, revetments, structures or other appurtenances subject to damage from wave action.

    (v)  (1) At locks at all fixed dams and at locks at all movable dams when the dams are up so that there is no navigable pass through the dam, the following navigation lights will be displayed during hours of darkness:

    (i) Three green lights visible through an arc of 360° arranged in a vertical line on the upstream end of the river (guard) wall unless the intermediate wall extends farther upstream. In the latter case, the lights will be placed on the upstream end of the intermediate wall.

    (ii) Two green lights visible through an arc of 360° arranged in a vertical line on the downstream end of the river (guard) wall unless the intermediate wall extends farther downstream. In the latter case, the lights will be placed on the downstream end of the intermediate wall.

    (iii) A single red light, visible through an arc of 360° on each end (upstream and downstream) of the land (guide) wall.

    (2) At movable dams when the dam has been lowered or partly lowered so that there is an unobstructed navigable pass through the dam, the navigation lights indicated in the following paragraphs will be displayed during hours of darkness until lock walls and weir piers are awash.

    (i) Three red lights visible through an arc of 360° arranged in a vertical line on the upstream end of the river (guard) wall.

    (ii) Two red lights visible through an arc of 360° arranged in a vertical line on the downstream end of the river (guard) wall.

    (iii) A single red light visible through an arc of 360° on each end (upstream and downstream) of the land (guide) wall.

    (3) After lock walls and weir piers are awash they will be marked as prescribed in paragraph (x) of this section.

    (4) If one or more bear traps or weirs are open or partially open, and may cause a set in current conditions at the upper approach to the locks, this fact will be indicated by displaying a white circular disk 5 feet in diameter, on or near the light support on the upstream end of the land (guide) wall during the hours of daylight, and will be indicated during hours of darkness by displaying a white (amber) light vertically under and 5 feet below the red light on the upstream end of the land (guide) wall.

    (5) At Locks No. 1 and 2, Green River, when the locks are not in operation because of high river stages, a single red light visible through an arc of 360° will be displayed on each end (upstream and downstream) of the lock river (guard) will at which time the lights referred to above will not be visible.

    (w)  A single red light visible through an arc of 360° shall be displayed during hours of darkness at each end of the river wall or extending guard structures until these structures are awash.

    (x)  (1) Whenever the river (guard) wall of the lock and any portion of the dam are awash, and until covered by a depth of water equal to the project depth, the limits of the navigable pass through the dam will be marked by buoys located at the upstream and downstream ends of the river (guard) wall, and by a single buoy over the end or ends of the portion or portions of the dam adjacent to the navigable pass over which project depth is not available. A red nun-type buoy will be used for such structures located on the left-hand side (facing downstream) of the river and a black can-type buoy for such structures located on the right-hand side. Buoys will be lighted, if practicable.

    (2) Where powerhouses or other substantial structures projecting considerably above the level of the lock wall are located on the river (guard) wall, a single red light located on top of one of these structures may be used instead of river wall buoys prescribed above until these structures are awash, after which they will be marked by a buoy of appropriate type and color (red nun or black can buoy) until covered by a depth of water equal to the project depth. Buoys will be lighted, if practicable.

    (y)  A copy of these regulations shall be kept at all times on board each vessel regularly engaged in navigating the rivers to which these regulations apply. Copies may be obtained from any lock office or District Engineer's office on request. Masters of such vessels are encouraged to have on board copies of the current edition of appropriate navigation charts.

    § 207.310   Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa; operation of power dam by Mississippi River Power Co.

#### § § 207.310

    (a) All previous regulations of the Secretary of War relating to the use of the Mississippi River for the generation of power by the Mississippi River Power Co., including the memorandum of March 24, 1908, approved by the Secretary of War, March 26, 1908, are rescinded, and the following regulations will govern the operation of the dam until further orders:

    (b) Excepting as specially provided in this section the normal flow of the river shall be discharged below the dam at all times of day and night.

    (c) The Mississippi River Power Co. shall not during the period of navigation raise the level of its pond behind the Keokuk Dam when the natural flow of the Mississippi River is falling or when such natural flow is less than approximately 64,000 cubic feet per second, which corresponds to a normal stage of 6 feet above low water at Keokuk, Iowa, except upon the written permission of the U.S. District Engineer in charge of this locality, such permit to state the period which such ponding may cover and the maximum variation in stage below the dam which may be caused by each ponding.

    (d) The granting of permits by the District Engineer shall be governed by the provision of the law authorizing the construction of the dam and its accessories, as follows:

    (e) The power company when proposing to raise or lower the pond, either under general authority or special permission, shall give due notice to the District Engineer or his authorized agent of its intention.

    (f) The power company shall hold all records relating to operations affecting the river discharge open to the inspection of the District Engineer or his authorized agent.

    (g) It shall be the duty of the district engineer or his authorized agent to observe closely and carefully the operations of the power company and to maintain in addition to such as may be maintained by the power company, such river and pool gages as may be advisable, and make from time to time such examinations as may be necessary for determining the effect of the operation of the power dam and accessories on the river channels.

    (h) The Department of the Army approves the method of regulating the flow below the Keokuk Dam by estimating the flow 24 hours in advance and maintenance of the stage corresponding to such flow as indicated by the river gage at U.S. Lock (the method employed during 1917). The general rules stated in paragraph (g) of this section are not intended to apply to unavoidable small compensating variations in pond level behind the dam inherent in such method of regulation.

    § 207.320   Mississippi River, Twin City Locks and Dam, St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minn.; pool level.

#### § § 207.320

    In accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Federal Power Commission License of June 7, 1923 (Project No. 362-Minn., Ford Motor Co.), this section is prescribed for the control of the pool level created by the Twin City Locks and Dam, Minneapolis, in the interest of navigation, and supersedes rules and regulations made effective January 1, 1928, by the Secretary of War:

    (a) The pool above the dam shall not be allowed to drop below elevation 744.5 (Cairo datum), except after loss or lowering of flashboards and before replacement or raising of same, during the navigation season; nor below elevation 743.3 during the period when the river is closed to navigation. The variation of pool level shall not exceed 0.5 foot per day whenever the pool is below elevation 745.5, and in addition, during the period when the river is closed to navigation, the maximum rate of such variation shall not exceed 0.1 foot per hour; except that during the navigation season, increases in pool level at rates greater than that specified may be made to eliminate wasting of water during an increase in river flow.

    (b) Whenever, due to high flows, the pool above the dam is above elevation 746.5, all flashboards on the crest of the dam shall be removed or in the lowered position.

    (c) To protect navigation in cases of emergency, such as the stranding of a boat or the loss of a pool below the Twin City Dam, etc., the licensee shall temporarily discharge water at such rates, subject to the limitations of paragraph (a) of this section, as may be directed by the U.S. District Engineer in charge of the locality.

    (d) It shall be the duty of the U.S. District Engineer in charge of the locality to notify the licensee of the periods during which the river shall be considered open to navigation.

    (e) It shall be the further duty of the said District Engineer or his authorized agent, by frequent inspections, to determine whether paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section are being observed. In case of noncompliance he shall so notify the licensee and report the facts to the Chief of Engineers.

They may be used sparingly for short durations within the lock to maintain the ship position near the mooring wall or in an emergency. Thrusters shall be at zero thrust during the period the ship is stopped and moored to the wall with all lines out, and during raising and lowering of pool levels within the chamber.

    (g) For passage through the canal, vessels or boats owned or operated by the U.S. Government may be given precedence over all others.

    (h) —(1)  All registered vessels will be passed through the locks in the order of their arrival at the dispatch point unless otherwise directed by the District Engineer or his authorized agents. When a vessel that has stopped on its own business is ready to proceed, it is not entitled to precedence over other vessels already dispatched.

    (2)  The following order of departure procedure will apply to vessels leaving the MacArthur Lock and Poe Lock simultaneously or at approximately the same time:

    (i) The first vessel to leave will be the vessel in the lock which is ready for vessel release first. The vessel in the other lock will be restrained by the gates remaining closed and the wire rope fender remaining in the down position.

    (A) On down bound passages, the vessel retained shall not leave the lock until such time as the bow of the vessel leaving first reaches the end of the East Center pier.

    (B) On up bound passages, the vessel retained shall not leave the lock until such time as the bow of the vessel leaving first reaches the railroad bridge.

    (ii) When a 1,000 foot vessel is ready to depart the Poe Lock and a vessel has left the MacArthur Lock already, the 1,000 foot vessel may start to leave once the bow of the other vessel reaches the end of the respective nose pier.

    (iii) Vessels will remain in radio contact with each other and with the Chief Lockmaster at all times until clear of the lock area.

    (iv) The need for a deviation from the procedures set forth in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section will be determined on a case by case basis by the Chief Lockmaster. If two vessels masters agree to a different departure scheme, they both shall notify the Chief Lockmaster and request a change.

    (i) Unless otherwise directed, all vessels or boats approaching the locks shall stop at the points indicated by signs placed on the canal piers until ordered by the District Engineer or his authorized agents to proceed into the lock.

    (j) Vessels and boats shall not proceed to enter or leave a lock until the lock gates are fully in their recesses and the lockmaster has given directions for starting.

    (k) Upon each passage through the canal, the master or clerk of the vessel or craft shall report to the canal office, upon the prescribed form, a statement of passengers, freight, and registered tonnage, and such other statistical information as may be required by the blank forms provided for the purpose.

    (l) No business, trading, or loading or landing of freight, baggage, or passengers will be allowed on or over the canal piers or lock walls, or over the other piers within the limits of the canal grounds, except by prior authority of the District Engineer or his authorized agents.

    (m) No person shall throw material of any kind into the canal, or litter the grounds with any refuse.

    (n) The releasing of vessel steam, water, or waste from side discharge openings upon the piers or lock walls, the cleaning of boiler flues in the locks or canal, or the emission of dense smoke from the stack of any vessel while passing through the locks, is forbidden.

    (o) No person shall enter or navigate the canal with a boat or other craft which, when entering or while navigating the canal, shall have an iron or irons projecting from it or a rough surface or surfaces on it which would be liable to damage the lock walls or canal piers.

    (p) No person shall cause or permit any vessel or boat of which he is in charge or on which he is employed to in any way obstruct the canal or delay in passing through it, except upon prior authority of the District Engineer or his authorized agents.

    (q) No person shall enter upon any part of the canal grounds except as permitted, either generally or in specific instances, by the District Engineer or his authorized agents. No person shall willfully or carelessly injure, tamper with, or damage the canal or any of the Government buildings, works or structures, trees or shrubbery, or other public property pertaining to the canal or canal grounds.

    (r) —(1)  Mariners are advised that often times adverse local weather conditions, , high winds, current conditions and/or inclement weather, exists as vessels approach, enter and/or depart the Soo Locks. These conditions combined with close quarters slow speed maneuvering, particularly with large vessels not equipped with bow or stern thrusters, may cause control difficulties for certain classes of vessels. Therefore, any vessel requesting lockage which in the opinion of the vessel master in consultation with the pilot on board, where applicable may experience severe control problems due to the above conditions, must request assistance by one or more tugs to ensure full control over the vessel at all times. Vessel masters and pilots must consult with the lockmaster concerning local conditions well in advance of arrival at the lock to allow tug assistance to be arranged if necessary. These guidelines apply to all vessels.

    (2)  All barges or other vessels navigating within the canal and not operating under their own power, whether approaching or leaving the locks, are required to be assisted by one or more tugs of sufficient power to ensure full control at all times.

    (s) Smoking and open flames are prohibited on the canal grounds within 50 feet of any tanker transiting the canal and locks, and on board the tanker transiting the locks except in such places as may be designated in the ship's regulations.

    (t) All oil tankers, barges, and other vessels which are used for transporting inflammable liquids, either with or without cargo, shall, if not equipped with fixed timber fenders, be prevented from contacting any unfendered pier, lock wall, or other structure by an adequate number of suitable fenders of timber, rubber, or rope placed between the vessel and such unfendered structure.

    (u) The locks will be opened and closed to navigation each year as provided in paragraphs (u) (1) and (2) of this section except as may be authorized by the Division Engineer. Consideration will be given to change in these dates in an emergency involving disaster to a vessel or other extraordinary circumstances.

    (1)  At least one lock will be placed in operation for the passage of vessels on March 25. Thereafter, additional locks will be placed in operation as traffic density demands.

    (2)  The locks will be maintained in operation only for the passage of down bound vessels departing from a Lake Superior port before midnight (2400 hours) of January 14, and of upbound vessels passing Detour before midnight (2400 hours) of January 15. Vessel owners are requested to report in advance to the Engineer in charge at Sault Ste. Marie, the name of vessel and time of departure from a Lake Superior port on January 14 before midnight, and of vessels passing Detour on January 15 before midnight, which may necessitate the continued operation of a lock to permit passage of vessel.

    (v) The maximum overall dimensions of vessels that will be permitted to transit MacArthur Lock are 730 feet in length and 75 feet in width, except as provided in paragraph (v)(1) of this section. Further, any vessel of greater length than 600 feet must be equipped with deck winches adequate to safely control the vessel in the lock under all conditions including that of power failure.

    (1) Whenever the Poe Lock is out of service for a period exceeding 24 hours the District Engineer may allow vessels greater than 730 feet in length, but not exceeding 767 feet in length to navigate the MacArthur Lock. Masters of vessels exceeding 730 feet in length shall be required to adhere to special handling procedures as prescribed by the District Engineer.

    (w) The maximum overall dimensions of vessels that will be permitted to transit the New Poe Lock without special restrictions are 100 feet in width, including fendering, and 1,000 feet in length, including steering poles or other projections. Vessels having overall widths of over 100 feet and not over 105 feet including fendering, and overall lengths of not more than 1,100 feet, including projections, will be permitted to transit the New Poe Lock at such times as determined by the District Engineer or his authorized representative that they will not unduly delay the transit of vessels of lesser dimensions, or endanger the lock structure because of wind, ice, or other adverse conditions. These vessels also will be subject to such special handling requirements as may be found necessary by the Area Engineer at time of transit. Vessels over 1,000 feet in length will be required to be equipped with six mooring cables and winches ready for use to assist in safe transit of the lock.

    (x) Masters or other persons refusing to comply with the regulations in this section or any orders given in pursuance thereof, or using profane, indecent, or abusive language, may, in the discretion of the District Engineer or his authorized agents, be denied the privileges of the locks and canal grounds.

    § 207.441   St. Marys Falls Canal and Locks, Mich.; security.

#### § § 207.441

    (a)  The regulations in this section are prescribed as protective measures. They supplement the general regulations contained in § 207.440 the provisions of which shall remain in full force and effect except as modified by this section.

    (b)  The following classes of vessels will not be permitted to transit the U.S. locks or enter any of the United States approach canals:

    (1)-(3) [Reserved]

    (4) —(i)  Cleaning and gas freeing of tanks on all hazardous material cargo vessels (as defined in 49 CFR part 171) shall not take place in a lock or any part of the Soo Locks approach canals from the outer end of the east center pier to the outer end of the southwest pier.

    (ii)  Whenever a tank vessel is approaching the Soo Locks and within the limits of the lock piers (outer ends of the southwest and east center piers) either above or below the locks, no other vessel will be released from the locks in the direction of the approaching tank vessel, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, until the tank vessel is within the lock chamber or securely moored to the approach pier. Whenever a tank vessel is within a Soo Lock Chamber, the tank vessel, unless certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, will not be released from the lock until the channel within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the lock, in the direction of the tank vessel, is clear of vessels or vessels therein are securely moored to the approach pier. This limits movement to a single vessel whenever a tank vessel is within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the locks, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products. Tank vessels to which this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) applies include those vessels carrying fuel oil, gasoline, crude oil or other flammable liquids in bulk, including vessels that are not certified gas free where the previous cargo was one of these liquids.

    (iii)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, tankers with any type cargo will be permitted to transit the MacArthur Lock when the locks park is closed. The exact dates and times that the park is closed varies, but generally these periods are from midnight to 6 a.m. June through September with one or two hour closure extensions in the early and late seasons. Tankers carrying non-combustible products that will not react hazardously with water or tankers that have been purged of gas or hazardous fumes and certified gas free will be allowed to transit the MacArthur Lock when the park is open.

    (5)  All vessels, except U.S. vessels of war and public vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101, carrying explosives are prohibited from transiting the U.S. Locks.

    (c)  Masters of vessels are responsible for the conduct of crew and passengers while transiting St. Marys Falls Canal and Locks and for strict compliance with the regulations. The following procedures are established for the control of persons embarking or debarking from vessels while transiting the locks:

    (1) The master or mate and not more than three deckhands will be permitted to go ashore from transiting vessels and then only for normal operations and business incident to the transit. A maximum of four men will be permitted ashore at any one time from any one ship.

    (2) —(i)  _Personnel_, including technicians, repairmen, and company officials will be permitted to embark at the locks if they are in possession of a letter addressed to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, from the vessel's master, the operators of the vessel, or the Lake Carriers' Association, requesting that the individual named therein be permitted to embark on a particular vessel. United States vessel personnel must also be in possession of a specially validated seaman's document issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. Their papers will be presented to the civilian guard on duty at the main gate on Portage Avenue who will arrange escort from the gate to the vessel. Luggage will be subject to inspection.

    (ii)  The vessel master will furnish prior notification to the Chief Lockmaster at St. Marys Falls Canal Tower (Radio Call WUD-31) that he has vessel personnel, technicians, repairmen or company officials aboard for whom he requests authority to debark. If authority to debark is granted such personnel will be furnished a letter by the vessel master, addressed to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, giving the name and position of the individual concerned. Personnel will not debark until they have been properly identified by a licensed officer of the vessel and the letter furnished to the escort provided from the civilian guard detail who will escort personnel to the gate. In the event a person debarking for medical attention is a litter case, notification will be given sufficiently in advance to permit the Chief Lockmaster to route the vessel to the MacArthur Lock in order that the long carry over the lock gates may be avoided. The Area Engineer will make the necessary arrangements for clearance of ambulances and medical personnel into the lock area.

    (3) No passengers or guest passengers will be permitted to embark or debark at St. Marys Falls Canal except in emergency when medical attention is required.

    (4) Letters cited in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are valid only for a single passage through the lock area. In the event frequent access to the area is required a request for extended access with reasons therefor will be submitted to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, who may arrange for the necessary clearance.

    (5) Emergency needs to embark or debark which develop with insufficient time to follow the procedure outlined in this paragraph will be approved or disapproved by the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, according to the circumstances of the individual case, and requests therefor should be promptly directed to him.

    § 207.460   Fox River, Wis.

#### § § 207.460

    (a) —(1)  The Fox River and Wolf River navigation seasons will commence and close as determined by the district engineer, Corps of Engineers, in charge of the locality, depending on conditions and need for lock service. Days and hours of lock operation will also be determined by the district engineer. Public notices will be issued announcing or revising the opening and closing dates and operating schedules at least 10 days in advance of such dates.

    (2)  The movement of all boats, vessels, tows, rafts and floating things, both powered and nonpowered, in the canals and locks, approaches to the canals, and at or near the dams, shall be subject to the direction of the lockmaster or his duly authorized representatives in charge at the locks.

    (3)  All boats approaching the locks shall signal for lockage by four distinct whistles of short duration. Locks will not be opened on such audible signal during the period when advance notice is required if the services of the lock tender are required elsewhere to meet prior requests for lockages.

    (4)  All craft being locked shall be secured to the mooring posts on the lock walls. Large craft shall use one head line and at least one spring line. Lines shall remain fastened until the signal is given by the lock tender for the craft to leave the lock.

    (5)  No boat, barge, raft or other floating craft shall tie up or in any way obstruct the canals or approaches, or delay entering or leaving the locks, except by permission from proper authority. Boats wishing to tie up for some hours or days in the canals must notify the Project Engineer directly or through a lock tender, and proper orders on the case will be given. Boats so using the canals must be securely moored in the places assigned, and if not removed promptly on due notice, will be removed, as directed by the Project Engineer at the owner's expense. Boats desiring to tie up in the canals for the purpose of unloading cargoes over the canal banks must, in each case, obtain permission in advance from the District Engineer. Request for such permission shall be submitted through the Project Engineer.

    (6)  (i) Commercial vessels, barges, rafts and tows engaged in commerce will be provided lockages during the same period as provided for pleasure boats (see paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section).

    (ii) Pleasure boats, powered and non-powered, houseboats and similar craft will be provided with not more than one lockage each way through the same lock in a 24-hour period.

    (iii) All small vessels or craft, such as skiffs, sculls, sailing boats, etc., shall be passed through locks in groups of not less than six at one lockage, or may be granted separate lockage if the traffic load at the time permits.

    (iv) Lockage may be provided during certain hours other than announced at the intermediate locks provided prior requests are made to the Corps of Engineers, Fox River Project Office. Requests may be made either in writing, by telephone or in person to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fox River Project Office, 1008 Augustine Street, Kaukauna, Wisconsin 54130, telephone: 414-766-3531.

    (7)  Vessel operators shall use great care not to strike any part of the locks or sluice walls, or any gate or appurtenance thereto, or machinery for operating the gates, or the walls protecting the banks of the canals. All boats using the canals shall be free from projecting irons or rough surfaces that would be liable to damage the locks or any part of the canals, and they must be provided with fenders to be used in guarding the lock walls, etc., from injury. Boats will not be permitted to enter or leave the locks until the lock gates are fully in the gate recesses, and the lock tender has directed the boat to proceed. No vessel shall be raced or crowded alongside another vessel, or be moved at such speed as will cause excessive swells or wash. Speed shall be kept at a minimum consistent with safe navigation.

    (8)  No one, unless authorized by the lock tender, shall open or close any gate, or valve, or in any way interfere with the employees in the discharge of their duties. The lock tender may call for assistance from the master of any boat using the lock should such aid be needed.

    (9)  No boat shall enter a canal or lock whose actual draft exceeds the least depth of water in the channel of the canal as given by the Project Engineer.

    (10)  Boats going downstream shall have the right-of-way over boats going upstream. Ordinarily, the boats or tows arriving first at any of the locks shall have precedence in passage except that those vessels which have given advance notice, when such notice is required, shall have precedence over other vessels when such notifying vessel is ready for passage. In all cases boats and barges belonging to the United States, or employed upon public works, shall have precedence over all others, and commercial passenger boats shall have precedence over tows. All boats not taking advantage of the first lawful opportunity to pass shall lose their turn. When lockage has started on tows requiring multiple lockages, all units of the tow will be locked ahead of other vessels traveling in the same direction. In the case of tows requiring two lockages, any craft awaiting lockage in the opposite direction will have priority over the second lockage of the tow.

    (11)  No boat or raft without power except small boats controlled by sails or oars shall be brought through the canal unless accompanied by a power operated boat.

    (12)  No refuse or other material shall be thrown or dumped from vessels into the natural river, improved channels, canals and locks or placed on any bank of the river or berm of the canals so that it is liable to be thrown or washed into the waterway. (Sec. 13 of the River and Harbor Act of Mar. 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152; 33 U.S.C. 407), prohibits the depositing of any refuse matter in any navigable water or along the banks thereof where the same shall be liable to be washed into such navigable water.)

    (13)  No water shall be drawn by any party or parties from any portion of the Fox River canals, or of the Fox River, including its lakes, improved channels and unimproved channels, to such extent as to lower the water surface below the crest of that dam next below the place where such draft of water is affected.

    (14)  Anyone who shall willfully or through carelessness in any way obstruct the free navigation of the waterway, or by violation of any of the laws or regulations governing the waterway and those using it, delay or inconvenience any boat having the right to use the waterway, shall be responsible for all damages and delays, and for all expenses for removing the obstructions. (Sec. 20 of the River and Harbor Act of Mar. 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1154; 33 U.S.C. 415), authorizes the immediate removal or destruction of any sunken vessel, craft or similar obstruction, which impedes or endangers navigation.)

    (15) [Reserved]

    (16)  Trespass on waterway property or injury to the banks, locks, dams, canals, piers, fences, trees, buildings or any other property of the United States pertaining to the waterway is strictly prohibited. No business, trading or landing of freight or baggage will be allowed on or over Government property, unless a permit or lease approved by the Secretary of the Army has been secured.

    (17)  (i) During periods of high water, when determined to be necessary by the District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District, Chicago, to reduce the threat of flooding, it shall be the duty of the person owning, operating, or controlling the dam across the Neenah Channel of the Fox River at Neenah, Wis., acting as agent of the United States, to open or close, or cause to be opened or closed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(17)(ii) of this section, the outlet works of said dam to regulate the passage of water through said outlet works.

    (ii) The outlet works of said dam shall be opened when and to the extent directed by the District Engineer or his authorized field representatives, and said outlet works shall thereafter be closed when and to the extent directed by the said District Engineer or his authorized field representative.

    (b)  (1) The drydock being a part of the Fox River improvement, its use will be governed by the general regulations for the use, administration, and navigation of that river, so far as they may be applicable.

    (2) The drydock at Kaukauna, when not required for repairs or construction by the United States, may be used by private parties or corporations under certain restrictions and under the supervision and direction of the U.S. District Engineer in charge of the locality or his authorized agent.

    (3) The drydock will be loaned to private parties only when no private drydock is available at the time and for the purpose desired. Applicants will be required to establish over their signature the fact that due effort has been made to secure the use of a private drydock and none can be had.

    (4) Private parties desiring to use the Kaukauna drydock will give notice to the U.S. Assistant Engineer in local charge at Appleton, Wis., as long in advance as practicable, stating when use of the dock is wanted, nature of repairs required, and the dimensions and character of boat. No boat will enter the dock until the permission of the U.S. District Engineer or the Assistant Engineer above referred to has been obtained.

    (5) All private parties or corporations using the Kaukauna drydock will furnish all material and labor, including blocking, when necessary, required for prompt execution of their work, and will also furnish all labor for properly operating, under the immediate personal supervision of an authorized canal employee, gates, and sluices of the drydock. No gate or sluice of the drydock will be operated, or in any way meddled with, except by permission of and under the personal supervision of such authorized canal employee.

    (6) No boat will be allowed to occupy the Kaukauna drydock for a longer period than 2 days when other boats are waiting to use the dock, except in cases when, in the opinion of the U.S. District Engineer or his authorized agent, circumstances necessitate and justify a longer use than 2 days. The U.S. District Engineer or his authorized agent is authorized to remove from the drydock any boat using or occupying such dock without his authority, and the expense of such removal will be paid by the party or parties owning such boat.

    (7) The wages of all mechanics and laborers, due from private parties for repairs carried on in the Kaukauna drydock, must be paid before the boat leaves the dock.

    (8) Repair shop, timber shed, tools, etc., owned by the Government at and near the drydock shall not be used by parties allowed to occupy the drydock.

    (9) Lumber and all material needed by parties allowed to use the drydock may be deposited in the drydock yards at such places as may be directed, but only for such time as repairs are being made, and residue must be entirely removed when the boat leaves the dock; general storage will not be permitted.

    (10) All refuse and old material taken from boats under repairs must be removed or disposed of, as may be directed, by the owner of the boat or his employees without expense to the Government, and before the boat leaves the dock, and to the satisfaction of the agent in charge of the dock.

    (11) The Government charges for the authorized and necessary use and occupancy of the Kaukauna drydock by private boats shall be, until further orders, as follows:

    (i) Docking charges (including lay time for the calendar day on which vessel is docked): Tugs, motor boats, and dredges, 75 cents per linear foot; $25 minimum charge. Barges, dump scows, and derrick boats, 65 cents per linear foot; $20 minimum charge.

    (ii) Lay-day charges (excluding Sundays and national holidays, unless repairs are made on such Sundays and holidays): For all vessels, 20 cents per linear foot per calendar day or part thereof; $7 per calendar day or part thereof, minimum charge.

    (12) The charges for all use or occupancy of the Kaukauna drydock by a boat or private parties, after repairs on such boat have, in the opinion of the U.S. District Engineer or authorized agent, been so far completed as to permit safe removal from the dock, or after such removal has been ordered by the U.S. District Engineer or his authorized agent, shall be $50 per day or part of a day, in addition to any penalties incurred for violation of any of the regulations prescribed by law for the government of the dock and those using it.

    (13) The dock will be considered in use by a boat from the time the dock is placed at its disposal until the boat is out of the dock.

    (14) The length of all vessels shall be the over-all length measured on the main deck from stem to stern.

    (15) The charges for the use of the drydock shall be paid within 10 days from date of bill, which will be submitted to the owner by the District Engineer as promptly as possible after the vessel leaves the dock. If charges are not so paid, the vessel shall be liable to the amount of the charges and the cost of collection in the manner prescribed by law, and the owner of the vessel shall be denied the use of the drydock until all charges and the cost of collection have been paid to the United States.

    (16) This section supersedes the regulations for the use of this drydock approved April 10, 1906, which regulations are hereby revoked.

    § 207.480   Lake Huron, Mich.; Harbor of refuge, Harbor Beach; use and navigation.

#### § § 207.480

    (a) All boats, barges, and vessels entering the harbor will be required to take such positions as may be assigned them by the officer in charge, who will direct their movements, either from the breakwater or from the Government tug on the harbor.

    (b) In the absence of any directions as to position, boats, barges, and vessels entering the harbor will observe the following rule: The first steam vessel, or the first steam vessel with consort in tow, on entering the harbor for shelter, will proceed to the upper end of the breakwater. All steam vessels, and all steam vessels with consorts in tow, entering later, will place themselves in a compact position close to those preceding them. Sailing craft will so locate themselves that they will not lie in the way of other vessels entering the harbor. All vessels of every description will in no way place themselves so as to interfere with the work of reconstruction of piers, or repairs, that may be in progress at the time.

    (c) The use of chains in making fast to the breakwater will not be permitted. Lines must be attached to the snubbing posts only, and outboard anchors taken in.

    (d) Steam craft with barges or vessels in tow will, if practicable, at once place them compactly alongside the breakwater, either taking in the towlines entirely or passing them on the breakwater so as not to interfere in any way with the landing or departure of boats or vessels between them. If impracticable to place them alongside the breakwater, they will each drop anchor and at once take in all towlines extending from one to the other.

    (e) Passenger boats will, in general, have the preference as to location and attention by the officer in charge. Rafts will give way to all documented craft.

    (f) All classes of boats, barges, vessels, or other floating property making fast to the breakwater must at once place such fenders between themselves and the breakwater as may be thought necessary by the officer in charge to prevent chafing or other damage.

    (g) The unloading of wood, coal, ballast, stone, or freight of any class upon the breakwater is expressly prohibited, except in certain cases allowed by special permission from the officer in charge.

    (h) Each and every piece of floating property made fast to the breakwater, or anchored in the harbor, must keep outboard from sunset to sunrise a conspicuous white light, and must have upon it and in immediate charge of it a watchman during the entire time such floating property is in the harbor. All colored lights must be at once taken in, or covered, on dropping anchor or making fast to the breakwater.

    § 207.590   Black Rock Canal and Lock at Buffalo, N.Y.; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.590

    (a) The term “canal” when used in this section will mean all of the Black Rock Waterway, including Black Rock Lock, and all of the lands, piers, buildings, and other appurtenances acquired by letters patent from the State of New York, or constructed for the use of the waterway; the southerly limit thereof being at the southerly end of Bird Island Pier, and the northerly limit being at the downstream end of the guide pier, Black Rock Lock, a length of 3.7 miles.

    (b) The canal and all of its appurtenances and the use, administration and navigation thereof shall be in charge of the District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District, in charge of the locality, or his authorized agents.

    (c) The movement of all vessels, boats, or other floating things in the canal shall be under the direction of the authorized agents of the District Engineer in charge, and their orders and instructions must be obeyed.

    (d) For passage through the canal, vessels or boats belonging to the U.S. Government shall have precedence over all others.

    (e) All registered vessels or boats must pass through the canal in order of their arrival at the canal limits, unless otherwise directed in accordance with this section.

    (f) [Reserved]

    (g) No vessel shall pass or approach within  -mile of a vessel bound in the same direction in the Black Rock Canal south of the Ferry Street Bridge. Tugs without tows, tugs towing a single barge under 150 feet in length, and single vessels under 150 feet in length are exempt from this paragraph.

    (h) No vessel or boat shall anchor in or moor along the canal except at localities specially designated by the District Engineer or his agent; and no business, trading, or landing of freight or baggage, except such articles as may be readily carried in the hand, will be allowed on or over the canal lands or structures, without the permission of the District Engineer or his agent.

    (i) No person or operator of a vessel in the Black Rock Canal, lock or approaching channels shall throw or discharge or permit to be thrown or discharged any solid material of any kind or any petroleum product of any kind into the canal, lock or appurtenant waters.

    (j) All vessels and tows shall be navigated with care so as not to strike or disturb the channel buoys or channel markers. If a buoy or other channel marker is accidentally struck, damaged or displaced, the fact shall be reported immediately to the Black Rock Lock, foot of Bridge Street, Buffalo, N.Y., telephone 876-5454.

    (k) Ferry Street Bridge: The clearheadroom under the bridge at low water datum is 17.3 feet for a width of 86 feet from the pivot pier, thence decreasing to 12.3 feet at the left (westerly) abutment.

    (1) All vessels and boats which cannot pass under the bridge shall, on approaching the bridge, reduce speed sufficiently to enable them to come to a dead stop, without touching the bridge, in case the movable span cannot be lifted. If the wind is dangerously strong, passage of the bridge shall not be attempted by large vessels without the aid of a tug or tugs.

    (2) Vessels and boats bound north shall have the right-of-way and priority for passage through the bridge over those bound south.

    (3) All vessels and boats desiring passage through the bridge shall signal therefor by one long and two short whistle blasts.

    (4) Upon receiving the opening signal, the bridge operator shall answer by giving the same signal on the bridge whistle and he shall then proceed at once to lift the bridge.

    (5) In case the bridge cannot be lifted, for any cause, the bridge operator shall answer a vessel signal by giving five short whistle blasts; and the vessel shall then be stopped until the bridge is ready to be lifted, when the bridge operator shall give the whistle signal for passage and the vessel may proceed.

    (6) In case the bridge is disabled so that it cannot be lifted for one-half hour or more pending repairs, red flags will be displayed on the bridge in daytime and two red lantern lights, one above the other, at night; and when such signals are displayed no vessel or boat shall signal for or attempt passage through the bridge.

    (l)  (1) The movement of vessels in the Black Rock Canal will be controlled by radio communication between the Black Rock Lock and the vessels desiring to use the canal. Vessels will not be permitted to meet or pass in the channel of restricted width between the southerly end of Bird Island (approximately 3,500 feet northerly along the canal from the North Breakwater South End Light) and the International Railway Bridge near the southerly entrance to the Black Rock Lock. Vessels less than 150 feet in length and tugs towing a single barge under 150 feet in length are not to be included in this special condition. In addition to the control of vessel movements in the restricted section of the canal, radio communications will also be utilized to facilitiate the passage of vessels through the entire canal and the Black Rock Lock.

    (2) Radio communication will be the only means of control of vessel traffic in the canal in order to prevent a meeting or passing of vessels in the restricted area, and therefore it is mandatory that all vessels over 150 feet in length and tugs towing a barge or barges over 150 feet in combined length of tow be equipped with radio communication equipment operating on designated frequencies. Any vessel lacking such equipment will not be permitted to enter the canal unless arrangements are made with the Black Rock Lock by land telephone to 876-5454 or marine ship-to-shore facilities immediately before entering the canal.

    (3) The Black Rock Lock radio communication equipment operates on VHF(FM) frequencies as follows: VHF—156.8 Mcs—Channel 16—Safety and Calling, VHF—156.7 Mcs—Channel 14—Working; VHF—156.6 Mcs—Channel 12 Working. A listening watch is maintained on VHF Channel 16.

    (4) In order that positive control may be maintained it is mandatory that the following procedures be followed in communicating by radio with the Black Rock Lock:

    (i) Vessels desiring to enter the Black Rock Canal from either the Buffalo Outer Harbor or the Buffalo River shall call the Black Rock Lock on VHF Channel 16 or by land telephone approximately 15 minutes before the estimated time of arrival at Buffalo Harbor Traffic Lighted Bell Buoy 1 located at latitude N. 42°50.1′ and longitude W. 78°55.4′. Information to be furnished the Black Rock Lock Operator should include the name of the vessel, position, destination, length, draft (forward and aft) and the type of cargo. A second call shall be made to the lock when the vessel is abreast of the Buffalo Harbor Light on the southerly end of the detached West Breakwater. Information furnished the vessel by the Lock Operator will assure the vessel operator of the proper time to enter the Black Rock Canal with a view to safety and minimum delay.

    (ii) Vessels desiring to enter the Black Rock Canal from either the Buffalo Outer Harbor or the Buffalo River shall call the Black Rock Lock on VHF Channel 16 or by land telephone to 876-5454 immediately before departing a dock and again when abreast of the North Breakwater South End Light on the southerly end of the North Breakwater.

    (iii) In any radio communication from a vessel to the Black Rock Lock, and VHF(FM) frequencies will be utilized.

    (iv) In any radio communication from a vessel to the Black Rock Lock, the VHF (FM) frequencies will be utilized if available in preference to the MF (AM) frequencies.

    (v) When an initial radio contact has been made with the Black Rock Lock the vessel entering the canal shall maintain a standby watch at the radio until the passage through the canal and lock is completed.

    (vi) Failure to comply with the foregoing procedures could result in considerable delay to a vessel and possibly in a collision between vessels in the restricted section of the canal.

    (m)  All vessels and boats desiring to use the lock shall signal by two long and two short whistle blasts.

    (1) Northbound vessels and boats shall not be brought to within less than 300 feet of the upper lock gates, nor shall southbound vessels be brought to within less than 200 feet of the lower lock gates, until the lock is made ready and the lockmaster in charge signals the vessel to enter the lock.

    (2) Vessels and boats shall not moor to the approach walls of the lock at either end, for any other purpose than waiting for lockage, except by direction or permission of the lockmaster.

    (3) Commercial vessels will receive preference in passage through the locks. Small vessels such as row, sail, and motor boats, bent on pleasure only, will be passed through the lock in company with commercial vessels when small vessels can be safely accommodated or in the absence of commercial vessels may be passed through the lock individually or together in one lockage on the hour if northbound and on the half hour if southbound. However, commercial vessels will receive preference which could delay the passage of pleasure craft. Pleasure craft will not be permitted to pass through the lock with vessels carrying inflammable cargo. Vessels and other large boats when in the lock shall fasten one head line and one spring line to the snubbing posts on the lock walls, and the lines shall not be cast off until the signal is given by the lockmaster for the boats to leave the lock.

    (4) Vessels and boats will be passed through the lock in order of their arrival except that the lockmaster may order a small vessel to lock through in company with another vessel, irrespective of the former's order of arrival.

    (5) All vessels and boats shall be maneuvered with great care so as not to strike any part of the lock walls, or any gate or appurtenance thereto, or machinery for operating the gates, or the walls protecting the lock approaches.

    (6) Vessels and boats shall not enter or leave until the lock gates are fully in their recesses, and the lockmaster has given direction for starting.

    (7) [Reserved]

    (8) Trespass on lock property is strictly prohibited. However, in that portion of the Black Rock Canal lying between the International Railway Bridge and the northerly end of the westerly lower guide pier, the following conditions shall apply to the embarking or disembarking of crew members or passengers of a vessel transiting the lock:

    (i) Only the master or mate and two or three linesmen will be permitted to go ashore from transiting vessels and then only for normal operations and business incident to the transit. A maximum of only four (4) men will be permitted to go ashore from any one ship.

    (ii) No crew members will be permitted to board a ship at the locks unless previously requested in writing by the master or owners, and approved by canal authorities.

    (iii) No crew member may leave a ship while it is in transit in the lock or canal unless certified in advance as an emergency by the vessel master and approved by canal authorities.

    (iv) No guest passengers will be permitted to either board or disembark at the canal or locks.

    (9) Schedule of Seasonal Operation:

    (i) March 23 through June 14—6 a.m. to 11 p.m., daily.

    (ii) June 15 through September 6-24 hours, daily.

    (iii) September 7 through November 30—6 a.m. to 11 p.m., daily.

    (iv) December 1 through March 22—8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., daily. During the navigation season the hours may be extended by the district engineer, depending on conditions and the need for lockage service. Public notices will be issued announcing the opening and closing dates at least 10 days in advance of such dates.

    (10)  In addition to the above schedule of operating hours, commercial vessels may be locked through during non-operational hours with prior arrangements made through the U.S. Army Engineer District, Buffalo. Requests for non-operational hours lockings shall be made at least 24 hours in advance by calling (716) 876-5454, extension 2284 or by radio as described in paragraph (l) of this section, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., except holidays. Requests shall include the approximate time of arrival and the name and call letters of the vessel or, if the vessel is not equipped to receive radio messages, a telephone number at which messages may be received for the vessel. If a requested lockage must be delayed, prompt notification shall be given by telephone or radio.

#### § § 207.610

    (a)-(c) [Reserved]

    (d) Vessels shall observe the following rule in mooring to the breakwater: The first self-propelled vessel stopping at the harbor for shelter will proceed to the upstream end of the breakwater and moor along either side of it. All similar vessels entering later will place themselves in a compact position close to those preceding them. Passenger vessels will, in general, have preference as to location of moorage. Sailing craft will so locate themselves that they will not lie in the way of other vessels entering the harbor. All vessels of every description will place themselves so as not to interfere with any work of reconstruction or repair that may be in progress at the time.

    (e) The use of chains in making fast to the breakwater is prohibited. Lines must be attached to the snubbing posts only, and outboard anchors taken in.

    (f) Vessels with other craft in tow will, if practicable, at once, moor them compactly along the breakwater, either taking in the towlines or placing the slack in them upon the breakwater in such a manner as not to interfere with other vessels. If necessary to moor alongside of other vessels moored to the breakwater, the towlines shall be taken in or disposed of in such a manner as not to interfere with the departure of vessels moored between them and the breakwater.

    (g) Vessels of every description mooring to the breakwater, must place suitable fenders between themselves and the breakwater to protect the timber walings on the breakwater from damage.

    (h) The unloading of freight of any class upon the breakwater is expressly prohibited, except in accordance with special permission from the said District Engineer or his representative.

    (i) Each and every vessel made fast to the breakwater, or anchored in the harbor without a line made fast to the shore or shore dock, must have at least one experienced person upon it during the entire time said vessel is thus moored in the harbor.

    § 207.640   Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel Barge Lock and Approach Canals; use, administration, and navigation.

#### § § 207.640

    (a) —(1)  The lock, its approach channels and all its appurtenances, including the highway and railroad bridge, shall be under the jurisdiction of the District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District, Sacramento, Federal and Courts Building, 650 Capitol Avenue, Sacramento, California. His designated representative at the locality shall be the lockmaster, who will be in immediate charge of movement and position of all water traffic while at or near the locks and in the barge canals.

    (2)  The lockmaster shall be charged with the immediate control and management of the lock, bridge, and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the entrance channels. He shall see that all laws, rules and regulations for the use of the lock, bridge and the lock area are duly complied with, to which end he is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith, both to employees of the Government and to any and every person within the Government lock area. Crews shall render such assistance in the lockage of their craft as may be required by the lockmaster.

    (3) —(i)  All craft desiring lockage shall signal by two long blasts followed by two short blasts of the whistle, delivered at a distance of one-half mile from the lock. When the lock is ready for entrance, notice will be given by one long blast from the control house. Permission to leave the lock will be one short blast given by the lockmaster.

    (ii)  Visual signals are located outside of each lock gate on the north guide wall, and will be used in conjunction with sound signals. When the red light is flashing, lock cannot be made ready for entrance immediately, vessel must stand clear. When the amber light is flashing, lock is being made ready, prepare for lockage. When the green light is flashing, lock is ready for entrance, the vessel may proceed with caution into the lock.

    (iii)  Visual signals are located on the south bank of the barge canal at the confluence with the Sacramento River and also 1,950 feet upstream on the west bank of the Sacramento River. When the red light is on, a river-bound vessel of a size making passing in the canal hazardous is in the lock or canal. Approaching vessel shall stand clear of canal to permit out-going vessel to pass. When the amber light is on, a river-bound vessel of a size to permit passing is in the lock or canal. Vessel may enter canal with caution. When the green light is on, vessel may enter canal and proceed under full control.

    (iv)  The lock is equipped with two-way radio operating on a frequency of 156.60 mc. The frequency is monitored by the lock personnel. Vessels equipped with two-way radio may communicate with the crew operating the lock but communications or signals so received will only augment and not replace the sound and visual signals.

    (4)  The lock chamber has a maximum usable width of 86 feet and length of 600 feet. The sill at the harbor end and the bottom of the lock chamber are −13.0 feet elevation, CofE datum, and usually provides a depth of water ranging from 14.0 feet at LLW to 19.4 feet at HHW, with greater depths during large floods in the delta. The sill at the river end is at −10.0 feet elevation, CofE datum, and usually provides a depth of water ranging from 14.6 feet at LLW to 16.8 feet at HHW, with greater depths when the river is high. The depth of water at any time is indicated by staff gages located on the south wall of the lock, riverward and harborward of each lock gate and at the center of the lock. A vessel must not attempt to enter the lock if its beam or length is greater than indicated above, or if its draft exceeds the depth of water indicated by the gages, with due allowance for clearance.

    (5)  Ordinarily, craft will be locked through in order of arrival; however, depending upon whether the lock is full or empty, this precedence may be modified at the discretion of the lockmaster if boats are approaching from the opposite direction and are within reasonable distance of the lock at the time of the approach by the first boat. When several craft are to pass, precedence shall be given as follows:

    (6)  Boats that fail to enter the lock with reasonable promptness, after being authorized to do so, shall lose their turn.

    (7)  The lockmaster shall decide whether one or more vessels may be locked through at the same time.

    (8)  Vessels shall not be raced or crowded alongside another in the barge canals. When entering the barge canals and lock, speed shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with safe navigation. As a general rule, when a number of vessels are entering the lock, the following vessel shall remain at least 200 feet astern of the vessel ahead. No overtaking, except when directed by lockmaster, will be permitted.

    (9) —(i)  The lockage of pleasure boats, skiffs, fishing boats and other small craft will be coordinated with the lockage of commercial craft. If no commercial craft are scheduled to be locked through within a reasonable time, not to exceed one hour after the arrival of the small craft at the lock, separate lockage will be made for such small craft.

    (ii)  Small boats desiring to use the lock will sound two long blasts followed by two short blasts of the horn. When the lock is ready for entrance, the lockmaster will notify the small boat by one long blast of the horn; or through the public address system. Permission to leave the lock will be given by the lockmaster by one short blast of the horn.

    (10)  All boats, when in the lock, shall be moored to the fastenings provided for that purpose, by bow and stern lines and other spring lines as may be necessary, and the lines shall not be let go until the signal is given by the lockmaster for the craft to leave the lock.

    (11)  The mooring or anchoring of boats or other craft in the approaches to the lock, where such mooring will interfere with navigation of the lock is prohibited. All boats, barge tows and other craft to be passed through the lock shall lie in designated waiting areas in such manner as not to interfere with the navigation of the lock or its approaches, and, if a barge tow is to be divided into sections for locking, the sections shall be brought into the lock as directed by the lockmaster. After passing through the lock, the sections shall be reassembled at such a distance from the entrance as not to obstruct or interfere with navigation of the lock or its approaches.

    (12)  Boats or barges must not obstruct navigation by unnecessary delays in entering or leaving the lock.

    (13)  The regulations contained in this paragraph shall not relieve the owners and operators of vessels from liability for any damage by their operations to the lock or other structures. They must use great care not to strike any part of the lock, any gate or appurtenance thereto, or machinery for operating the gates, or the walls protecting the banks of the approach canals. All boats with metal nosings or projecting irons, or rough surfaces that would be liable to damage the gates or lock walls, will not be permitted to enter the lock unless provided with suitable buffers and fenders.

    (14)  Tows shall be made up outside the canal entrance. All vessels engaged in towing other vessels not equipped with a rudder shall use two tow lines or a bridge and one tow line. If the vessel in tow is equipped with a rudder, one tow line may be used. All tow lines or hawsers must be hauled as short as practicable for safe handling of tows.

    (15)  The pilots in charge of tows and persons in charge of other craft must provide a sufficient number of men to handle lines in mooring craft and to move barges and other craft into and out of the lock easily and promptly.

    (16)  No person, unless authorized by the lockmaster shall open or close any bridge, gate, valve or operate any machinery in connection with the lock; but the lockmaster may, under emergency conditions, call for assistance from the master of any boat using the lock, should such aid be necessary, and when rendering such assistance, the man so employed shall be strictly under the orders of the lockmaster.

    (17)  No one shall land freight or baggage on or over the walls of the lock so as in any way to delay or interfere with navigation or the operation of the lock.

    (18)  No material of any kind shall be thrown or discharged into the lock, and no material of any kind shall be deposited into the lock area.

    (19) [Reserved]

    (20)  If the owner or pilot of any boat persistently violates the regulations of this paragraph after due notice of the same, lockage may be refused by the lockmaster at the time of the violation or subsequent thereto, as required in the interest of public safety or protection of Government property.

    (21)  In all other respects, the existing Federal laws, rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the United States will govern in the use, administration and navigation of the ship channel, lock and its approaches.

    (2)  All vessels desiring lockage shall signal the same by one long and one short blast of the whistle, delivered at a distance of approximately 1,000 feet from the locks. Requests for lockage may also be made by contacting the lockmaster on VHF-FM radio on channel 14, at WUJ 363, Willamette Falls Locks or by telephone or otherwise notifying the lockmaster's office. Notice to vessels desiring lockage will be given by red and green traffic lights. Vessels may enter locks on green lights, but must await green signal when lights are red. Permission to leave the lock will be given in the same manner. In the event a failure occurs and the referenced lights cannot be operated, the lockmaster will indicate by voice or by hand or lantern signals when vessels may enter or leave the locks.

    (3)  For lockage purposes the maximum length of space available is 175 feet and the maximum clear width available is 37 feet. All vessels, boats, rafts, barges, or other floating things of less size than the foregoing dimensions can pass through the locks. The controlling water depth over the intermediate miter sills throughout the locks is 6.5 feet. However, the depth on the sill of the upstream gate at low water is 7.5 feet and over the downstream sill is 8.4 feet. The elevation of the upstream sill is 43.7 feet and of the downstream sill is −6.4 feet, corresponding to the elevations shown on the gages provided at both the downstream and upstream approaches to the locks. All vessels, boats, rafts, barges, and other floating things of which the dimensions or draft are greater than will permit clearing any of the above indicated elevations shall be prohibited from entering the locks. All vessels, boats, rafts, barges or other floating things entering the locks in violation of the above shall be responsible for all resulting damages.

    (4)  Ordinarily the vessel, boat, raft, barge, or other floating thing arriving first at the lock will be locked through first. In the event of a simultaneous approach from opposite directions ascending craft will ordinarily be locked through first. When several boats are to be passed through the locks, the order of precedence shall be as follows:

    (i) To boats owned by the United States or employed upon river and harbor improvement work.

    (ii) To passenger boats.

    (iii) To freight and tow boats.

    (iv) To rafts.

    (v) To small vessels and pleasure craft.

    (5)  The lock master shall decide whether one or more vessels may be locked through at the same time. No one shall attempt to enter the locks with a vessel or attempt to cause a vessel to enter the locks until he is authorized by the lock master to do so. No one shall take a vessel, or cause a vessel to be taken, within the limits of 500 feet above the upper gate and 300 feet below the lower gate, except for the purpose of entering the locks; and not for this purpose until it has been indicated to him by a proper person by signal that the lock is ready to receive the vessel. All vessels within the foregoing limits must be operated under “slow bell” and be kept constantly under control.

    (6)  Pleasure boats, skiffs, fishing boats, and other small craft may be passed through the locks singularly, in groups, or as part of a lockage of other than pleasure craft. A continual flow of traffic in one direction will not be interrupted or reversed to accommodate these small pleasure boats. However, any such small boat will be accommodated at such time as the lock master upon receipt of a request for lockage deems such action will not interfere with other traffic. The decision of the lock master shall be final as to whether craft requesting lockage is defined as a pleasure boat.

    (7)  No person, unless authorized by the lockmaster or his assistants, shall open or close any bridge, lock gate, wicket gate, or operate any lock machinery, or in any way interfere with any mechanism or appliance connected with the operation of the locks, nor shall anyone interfere with the employees in the discharge of their duties. The lockmaster or his assistants may call for aid from the persons in charge of any craft, vessel, or raft using the lock should such aid be necessary. Persons rendering such assistance shall be strictly under the orders of the lockmaster. The Government reserves the right to refuse lockage to any vessel, craft or raft when the persons in charge thereof refuse to give such assistance when it is requested. The persons in charge of vessels with tows or rafts, barges and other craft must provide sufficient personnel, lines and towing equipment of sufficient power to insure at all times full control of such tows, rafts, barges and other craft while moving into and through the locks, unless otherwise prearranged with the lockmaster. A copy of these regulations shall be kept on board each vessel regularly engaged in navigating the locks. Copies may be obtained without charge from the lockmaster or from the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, 319 S.W. Pine Street, Post Office Box 2946, Portland, Oregon 97208.

    (8)  All tankers, barges, and other floating equipment, used for transporting inflammable liquids, either with or without cargo, shall be equipped with fixed timber fenders and, if not so equipped, shall have aboard an adequate number of suitable fenders of timber, rubber, or rope which are to be placed between the vessel and unfendered lock structures. All such barges or other vessels navigating without power within the canal or locks must be assisted by one or more tugs of sufficient power to insure full control at all times whether passing upstream or downstream through the locks with or without cargo.

    (9)  All boats, barges, rafts, and other craft when in the locks shall be moored by head and spring lines and such other lines as may be necessary to the fastenings provided for that purpose; and the lines shall not be unloosed until the signal is given for the vessel to leave the lock.

    (10)  The mooring of boats, tows or other craft in the approaches to the locks where such mooring will interfere with navigation or other vessels to or from the locks is prohibited.

    (11)  Boats, barges, rafts, or other craft must not obstruct navigation by unnecessary delay in entering or leaving the locks. Vessels failing to enter the locks with reasonable promptness, when signaled to do so, and vessels arriving at the locks with their tows in such shape so as to impede lockage shall forfeit their turn.

    (12)  No freight or baggage shall be unloaded on or over the walls of the canal or locks. Freight and baggage consigned to the Willamette Falls locks shall be unloaded only at such places as may be provided for this purpose or as directed by the lock master.

    (13)  No refuse or other material shall be thrown or dumped from vessels into the canal and locks, or deposited in the lock area, or placed on the berm of the canal so that it is liable to be thrown or washed into the waterway. Violations of this paragraph (b)(13) shall be subject to sections 13 and 16 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 407, 411).

    (14)  The regulations contained in this section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of vessels for any damage caused by their operations to the locks or other structures. Persons in charge of vessels and log rafts passing through the locks must use great care to prevent the vessels or log rafts from striking any gate or appurtenance thereto. All boats or barges with metal nosings, or projecting irons, or rough surfaces, and log rafts with dragging cables that may damage any part of the lock structures will not be permitted to enter the locks unless said craft are provided with suitable protective buffers and fenders and log rafts are free of loose, dragging cables.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d)  No one shall trespass on the grounds or buildings, and everyone shall be deemed guilty of trespass within the meaning of this paragraph who shall willfully or carelessly damage or disfigure the canal and locks or any part thereof, or any building or appliance on the grounds, or who shall carry on business or trading of any sort, or shall build any fishing stand or lead, or set any fish net within the limits of the reservation, or do any act to or on the grounds or buildings which would be recognized by law as a trespass.

    (e)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, whenever such a word as “vessel”, “boat”, “barge”, “raft”, or the like is used in this section, it shall include all types of floating things which may be subject to lockage. Failure to refer specifically to a type of floating thing by its name shall not mean exclusion thereof from applicability of this section.

    § 207.718   Navigation locks and approach channels, Columbia and Snake Rivers, Oreg. and Wash.

#### § § 207.718

    (a)  All locks, approach channels, and all lock appurtenances, shall be under the jurisdiction of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, in charge of the locality. The district engineer may, after issuing a public notice and providing a 30-day opportunity for public comment, set (issue) a schedule for the daily lockage of recreational vessels. Recreational vessels are pleasure boats such a row, sail, or motor boats used for recreational purposes. Commercial vessels include licensed commercial passenger vessels operating on a published schedule or regularly operating in the “for hire” trade. Any recreational schedule shall provide for a minimum of one scheduled recreation lockage upstream and downstream (two lockages) each day. At the discretion of the district engineer, additional lockages may be scheduled. Each schedule and any changes to the schedule will be issued at least 30 days prior to implementation. Prior to issuing any schedule or any change to the schedule, the district engineer will consider all public comments and will evaluate the expected energy situation, water supply, and recreation use of the lock to determine the seasonal need for the schedule or change in schedule. The district engineer's representative at the locks shall be the project engineer, who shall issue orders and instructions to the lockmaster in charge of the lock. Hereinafter, the term “lockmaster” shall be used to designate the person in immediate charge of the lock at any given time. In case of emergency and on all routine work in connection with the operation of the lock, the lockmaster shall have authority to take action without waiting for instructions from the project engineer.

    (b)  The Lock Master shall be charged with immediate control and management of the lock, and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. Upstream and downstream approach channels extend to the end of the wing or the guide wall, whichever is longer. At Bonneville lock the upstream approach channel extends to the mooring tie offs at Fort Rains and the downstream approach channel extends to the downstream tip of Robins Island. The Lock Master shall demand compliance with all laws, rules and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area and is authorized to issue necessary orders and directions, both to employees of the Government or to other persons within the limits of the lock or lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. Use of lock facilities is contingent upon compliance with regulations, Lock Master instructions and the safety of people and property.

    (c)  No one shall initiate any movement of any vessel in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the Lock Master. (“Vessel” as used herein includes all connected units, tugs, barges, tows, boats or other floating objects.)

    (d) —(1)  All locks are equipped with two-way FM radio operating on channel 14, frequency of 156.700 MHz, for both the calling channel and the working channel. Vessels equipped with two-way radio desiring a lockage shall call WUJ 33 Bonneville, WUJ 34 The Dalles, WUJ 35 John Day, WUJ 41 McNary, WUJ 42 Ice Harbor, WUJ 43 Lower Monumental, WUJ 44 Little Goose, or WUJ 45 Lower Granite, at least one-half hour in advance of arrival since the Lock Master is not in constant attendance of the locks. Channel 14 shall be monitored constantly in the vessel pilot house from the time the vessel enters the approach channel until its completion of exit. Prior to entering the lock chamber, the commercial freight or log-tow vessel operator shall report the nature of any cargo, the maximum length, width and draft of the vessel and whether the vessel is in any way hazardous because of its condition or the cargo it carries or has carried.

    (2)  Pull-cord signal stations marked by large instructional signs and located near the end of the upstream and downstream lock entrance walls may be used in place of radios to signal the Lock Master for a lockage.

    (3)  Signal lights are located outside each lock gate. When the green (go) light is on, all vessels will enter in the sequence prescribed by the Lock Master. When the red (stop) light is on, the lock is not ready for entrance and vessels shall stand clear. In addition to the above visual signals, the Lock Master will signal that the lock is ready for entrance by sounding one long blast on the lock air horn. The Lock Master will signal that the lock is ready for exit by lighting the green exit light and sounding one short blast on the air horn.

    (4)  Upon query from Lock Master, a vessel operator will signal when he is properly moored and ready for the lockage to begin.

    (e)  Nominal overall dimensions of vessels allowed in the lock chamber are 84 feet wide and 650 feet long. Depth of water in the lock depends upon river levels which may vary from day to day. Staff gauges showing the minimum water level depth over gate sills are located inside the lock chamber near each lock gate and outside the lock chamber near the end of both upstream and downstream guide walls, except at Bonneville where the staff gauges show water levels in feet above MSL and are located on the southern guide walls at the upstream and downstream miter gates. Bonneville's upstream sill elevation is 51 feet MSL and the downstream sill elevation is −12 feet MSL. Depth over sill at Bonneville is determined by subtracting the sill elevation from the gauge reading. Vessels shall not enter the navigation lock unless the vessel draft is at least one foot less than the water depth over the sill. Information concerning allowable draft for vessel passage through the locks may be obtained from the Lock Master. Minimum lock chamber water level depth is 15 feet except at Ice Harbor where it is 14 feet and at Bonneville where it is 19 feet. When the river flow at Lower Granite exceeds 330,000 cubic feet per second the normal minimum 15-foot depth may be decreased to as little as eight feet.

    (f)  Subject to the order of precedence, the vessel or tow arriving first; at the lock will be locked through first, however, this precedence may be modified at the discretion of the lockmaster. If immediate passage is required, lockage of vessels owned or operated by the United States shall take precedence. The precedence of all other vessels shall be as follows:

    (1) When a recreational vessel lockage schedule is in effect, at the appointed time for lockage of recreation craft, recreation craft shall take precedence; however, commercial vessels may be locked through with recreation craft if safety and space permit. At other than the appointed time, the lockage of commercial and tow vessels shall take precedence and recreational craft may (only) lock through with commercial vessels only as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.

    (2) If a recreational vessel lockage schedule is not in effect, commercial and tow vessels shall take precedence. Recreational craft may be locked through with commercial craft. If no commercial vessels are scheduled to be locked through within a reasonable time, not to exceed one hour after the arrival of the recreational vessels at the lock, the recreational vessel may be locked through separately. If a combined lockage cannot be arranged, the recreational craft shall be locked through after waiting three commercial lockages.

    (g)  Vessels that fail to enter the lock with reasonable promptness, after being authorized to do so, shall lose their turn.

    (h) —(1)  The Lock Master shall decide whether one or more vessels or tows may be locked through at the same time. Vessels with flammable or highly hazardous cargo will be passed separately from all other vessels. Hazardous materials are described in part 171, title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. Flammable materials are defined in the National Fire Code of the National Fire Protection Association.

    (2)  By mutual agreement of (all parties,) the lockmaster and the captains of the vessels involved, recreational vessels may be locked through with commercial vessels. Under the recreational vessel schedule, separate lockage will not be made by recreational vessels except in accordance with the recreational lockage schedule or when circumstances warrant, such as in an emergency. When recreational craft are locked simultaneously with commercial vessels, the recreational vessel will enter the lock chamber after the commercial vessel is secured in the chamber and when practicable will depart while the commercial vessel remains secured.

    (3)  Recreational boating groups may request special schedules by contacting the district engineer. The schedule for the daily lockage of recreational vessels will indicate the number of boats required for a special schedule and how many days' notice is required in order to arrange a special schedule.

    (i)  Mooring or anchoring in the approaches to the lock is prohibited where such mooring will interfere with navigation.

    (j)  Vessels waiting for lockage shall wait in the clear outside of the lock approach channel, or contingent upon permission by the Lock Master, may at their own risk, lie inside the approach channel at a place specified by the Lock Master. At Bonneville, vessels may at their own risk, lay-to at the downstream moorage facility on the north shore downstream from the north guide wall provided a 100-foot-wide open channel is maintained.

    (k)  All vessels must be moored within the lock chamber so that no portion of any vessel extends beyond the lines painted on the lock walls. Moorage within the lock chamber will be to floating mooring bits only and will be accomplished in a proper no-slip manner. Small vessels will not be locked with a large vessel unless the large vessel is so moored (two mooring bits) that no lateral movement is possible. The vessel operator will constantly monitor the position of his vessel and his mooring bit ties to assure that there is no fore or aft movement of his vessel and lateral movement is minimized. Propulsion by vessels within the lock chamber will not be permitted during closure operation of a lock chamber gate or as otherwise directed by the Lock Master.

    (l)  During the entire lockage, the vessel operator shall constantly attend the wheelhouse, be aware of the vessel's position, and monitor radio channel 14 on frequency 156.700 MHz, or otherwise be constantly able to communicate with the Lock Master. At a minimum, vessels shall be as vigilantly manned as if underway.

    (m)  Vessels shall be adequately powered to maintain a safe speed and be under control at all times. Vessels shall not be raced or crowded alongside another in the approach channels. When entering the lock, speed shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with safe navigation. As a general rule, when a number of vessels are entering the lock, the following vessel shall remain at least 200 feet astern of the vessel ahead.

    (n)  Vessels shall not unnecessarily delay any operation of the locks.

    (o)  No freight, baggage, personnel, or passengers shall be landed on or over the walls of the lock, except by permission and direction of the Lock Master.

    (p)  The regulations in this section shall not relieve owners and/or operators of vessels from liability for any damage to the lock or other structures or for the immediate removal of any obstruction. No vessel in less than stable floating condition or having unusual sinking potential shall enter the locks or its approaches. Vessels must use great care not to strike any part of the lock, any gate or appurtenance thereto, or machinery for operating the gates, or the walls protecting the banks of the approach channels. All vessels with projecting irons, or rough surfaces which may damage the gates or lock walls, shall not enter the lock unless provided with suitable buffers and fenders. Vessels having chains, lines, or drags either hanging over the sides or ends or dragging on the bottom for steering or other purposes will not be permitted to pass.

    (q)  Prior to a lockage, the person in charge of a vessel towing a second vessel by lines shall, at a safe distance outside of the incoming approach channel, secure the second vessel to the towing vessel and keep it secured during the entire course of a lockage and until safely clear of the outgoing approach channel.

    (r)  Any violation of these regulations may subject the owner or master of any vessel to any or all of the following: (1) Penalties prescribed by law of the U.S. Government (33 U.S.C. part 1); (2) Report of violation to the titled owner of the vessel; (3) Report of violation to the U.S. Coast Guard; (4) Refusal of lockage at the time of violation.

    (s)  No material of any kind shall be thrown or discharged into the lock, or be deposited in the lock area. Vessels leaking or spilling cargo will be refused lockage and suitable reports will be made to the U.S. Coast Guard. Deck cargo will be so positioned so as not to be subject to falling overboard.

    (t)  No person, unless authorized by the Lock Master, shall open or close any bridge, gate, valve, or operate any machinery in connection with the lock. However, the Lock Master may call for assistance from the master of any vessel using the lock, should such aid be necessary; and when rendering such assistance, the person so employed shall be directly under the orders of the Lock Master. Masters of vessels refusing to provide such assistance when it is requested of them may be denied the use of the lock by the Lock Master.

    (u)-(v) [Reserved]

    (w)  No vessel shall enter or remain in any restricted area at any time without first obtaining permission from the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, or his duly authorized representative.

    (1)  The water restricted to all vessels, except Government vessels, are described as all waters of the Columbia River and Bradford Slough within 1,000 feet above the first powerhouse, spillway, and second powerhouse (excluding the new navigation lock channel) and all waters below the first powerhouse, spillway, second powerhouse, and old navigation lock. This is bounded by a line commencing from the westernmost tip of Robins Island on the Oregon side of the river and running in a South 65 degrees West direction a distance of approximately 2,100 feet to a point 50 feet upstream of the Hamilton Island Boat Ramp on the Washington shore.

    § 207.750   Puget Sound Area, Wash.

#### § § 207.750

    (a) —(1)  The “canal grounds” when used in this paragraph shall mean that area between the south end of the jetties in Oak Bay and the northern end of the dredge channel approximately 400 yards northwest of Port Townsend Canal Light. The “canal” is the water lying between these limits and the banks containing the same.

    (2) [Reserved]

    (3)  No business, loading, or landing of freight or baggage will be allowed on or over the canal piers or bulkheads.

    (4)  No person shall throw material of any kind into the canal.

    (5) [Reserved]

    (6)  On the canal's being obstructed by a vessel, raft, or other craft, by sinking, grounding, or otherwise, the District Engineer, Seattle, shall be notified by telephone or telegraph as soon as possible by the person in charge of the obstructing vessel, raft, or craft.

    (b) —(1)  The term “canal” as used in the regulations in this paragraph shall include the water area in the locks and the channel and adjacent waters from a point 5,500 feet northwest of the Burlington Northern, Inc. railway bridge to the east end of the channel opposite Webster Point, Lake Washington. The term “canal grounds” shall include all grounds set aside for the use of the canal or occupied in its construction.

    (2)  The canal and all its appurtenances shall be under the supervision of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Seattle. The District Engineer will detail as many assistants as may be necessary for the efficient operation of the canal and the enforcement of the regulations in this paragraph. The movement of all vessels and other floating things in the canal and approaches thereto shall be under the direction of the District Engineer and his authorized assistants. All orders given under the regulations to any master or person in charge of any vessel, raft, or other watercraft by the District Engineer or his authorized assistants, either in person or through any canal operative, shall be acknowledged and obeyed. Failure to see, understand, or comply with signals or instructions shall constitute a violation of the regulations. Any person refusing to comply with the regulations or any orders given in pursuance thereof may be denied the privileges of the canal or canal grounds.

    (3)  To avoid damage to other vessels and to property along the shores, all vessels shall proceed at reduced speed in the canal as follows:

    (i) From the west entrance of the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the western end of the west guide pier of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and from the east end of the easternmost guide pier of said Locks to the white flashing dolphin located south of Webster Point on Lake Washington, including all of Salmon Bay, Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Union Bay, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate any watercraft or vessel at a speed in excess of 7 nautical miles per hour within 200 feet of any shoreline, pier, restricted area or shore installation.

    (ii) From the western end of the aforesaid west guide pier to the eastern end of the aforesaid east guide pier at said Locks, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate any watercraft or vessel at a speed in excess of 4 nautical miles per hour.

    (4)  In addition to the lock signal lights described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, a red light, and a green light are installed on the west side of the Ballard Bridge, on the east side of the Fremont Bridge, 1,000 feet west of the Montlake Bridge, and 1,000 feet east of the Montlake Bridge, for the guidance of vessels approaching the sections of the canal between Salmon Bay and Lake Union and between Lake Union and Lake Washington, respectively. Vessels of 300 gross tons and over and all vessels with tows, except as hereinafter provided, shall not pass the red lights. The green lights will indicate that vessels may proceed. Vessels of less than 300 gross tons without tows may disregard these signals, but they shall travel at very slow speed when passing other vessels. Vessels of 300 gross tons and over and vessels with tows, except logs, whose destination is easterly between the Ballard Bridge and a point 2,500 feet east of the Ballard Bridge, may pass the red signals on the Ballard Bridge, provided, such passage will not interfere with approaching traffic.

    (5) —(i)  Vessels with tows desiring to use the locks shall so indicate by two long and three short blasts of a whistle, horn, or megaphone. All other vessels desiring to use the locks shall so indicate by two long and two short blasts.

    (ii)  Red and green signal lights are installed on the guide pier west of the Burlington Northern, Inc. railway bridge below the locks. The green light will indicate to vessels bound for the large lock that the lock has been made ready. If the red light is burning, vessels bound for the large lock shall moor at the pier. Vessels bound for the small lock shall be guided into the small lock by traffic signals thereon. The masters of all vessels approaching the locks from Puget Sound shall be alert to receive and shall immediately comply with instructions by voice or signal from the employee on the west pier.

    (iii)  All vessels approaching the locks shall stop at the points indicated by signs placed on the canal piers or as directed by a lockman until ordered to proceed into the lock. Unless otherwise directed by the District Engineer or his authorized assistants, vessels owned or operated by the United States or the City of Seattle and passenger vessels operating on a regular schedule shall have precedence over all others in passing through the locks. Registered merchant vessels shall have precedence over pleasure craft, which shall pass through in the order of their arrival at the locks, and both shall have precedence over vessels towing floated timber or logs. Tows of floated timber and logs may be denied the use of the locks during certain hours when both locks are busy passing other traffic. However, advance notice will be given towboat companies as to the periods when log tows will be denied lockage.

    (iv)  Masters of vessels shall exercise the greatest care when entering either lock. The forward movement of vessels while taking position in the locks shall be very slow, and boats entering the small lock shall reduce their speed to not more than two and one-half miles per hour when within 200 feet of the outer gate and come to practically a full stop before entering the lock so that in case the engine mechanism fails to operate properly the momentum of the boat may be stopped easily by its lines. The masters of vessels entering either lock from either direction shall be alert to receive and shall immediately comply with instructions by voice or signal from the lock attendants.

    (v)  Vessels entering the locks shall be equipped with adequate lines, at least 50 feet in length being required fore and aft. While in the large lock vessels and rafts will be moored at the top of the lock wall. While in the small lock vessels shall be moored to the floating mooring wall. Lines shall not be released until the signal has been given by the lock force to leave the lock, after which there shall be no delay in leaving. All vessels not equipped to handle tie-up lines with power winches shall be equipped with suitable mooring lines of manila, or other suitable fiber, of sufficient size and strength to hold the vessel against the currents to be met within the lock chamber. The use of wire rope for tie-up by vessels not equipped to handle such lines with power winches is prohibited. Vessels may be denied the use of the locks if their lines are not in good condition, or if the mooring bits on barges are not accessible or are not equipped to prevent lines from slipping off when the water is lowered in the lock. All vessels entering the locks should have, in addition to the master, at least one person on deck to handle lines. Mates and deckhands, when preparing to moor within the lock chambers, should not throw heavy mooring lines at the lockmen on the walls, but should wait for a heaving lie to be passed to them unless otherwise directed. All towboat crews, while locking or moving a tow out of the lock chamber, should station themselves so as to preclude the possibility of being injured by the parting of cable or lines under strain. Persons attempting to take vessels through the locks without assistance on deck may be required to wait until the lock is clear of other traffic before passing through. All operators of vessels are especially cautioned to use extreme care while crowded in the locks to avoid accident or fire on their boats. Under no circumstances will small craft, such as rowboats, launches and houseboats, or any other type of pleasure boats, be locked through with barges used for carrying any type of petroleum product or other hazardous material. At the discretion of the lockmaster, small craft as described above may be locked through with barge tows containing other than dangerous material. Operators of small vessels and larger vessels operating in the proximity of each other shall be alert to the danger arising from the limited maneuverability of the larger vessels, and shall exercise all precautions to prevent accident.

    (6)  (i) The regulations in this paragraph shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of vessels for any damage caused by their operations to the locks or other structures. The sides and corners of all vessels and rafts passing through the locks should be free from spikes or projections of any kind which might damage the locks or other structures. Vessels with appurtenances or projections which might damage the locks or other structures shall be fitted with adequate fenders. Lockage of leaking vessels or vessels with overhanging loads may be refused. Such barge or craft shall be moored in a location outside of the channel approach to the lock so as to not interfere with passing navigation. Vessels of unusual dimensions, or other characteristics which, in the opinion of the lockmaster, pose a threat to the integrity or safety of the locks or canal will be refused passage until written permission to pass is provided by the District Engineer. Sufficient written data and drawings shall be provided the District Engineer that an engineering determination can be made as to the safety of the vessel. The District Engineer shall have the right to inspect any such vessels prior to passage. The operators of all vessels shall use care to avoid striking the guide walls or other structures pertaining to the canal.

    (ii) In the interest of safety and fire prevention, all woven rope fenders used with barges carrying flammable cargo should be water-soaked or otherwise fireproofed prior to entering the lock approaches.

    (iii) Burning fenders should be dropped overboard immediately rather than being placed on the deck of a barge or towboat.

    (iv) A minimum of one man with a portable fender shall be stationed at the head end of every tow of hazardous cargo and at the aft if the lockmaster so directs so as to protect the lock and guide walls from damage while entering or departing the lock structures.

    (v) All cylinder or containers holding gases under pressure, or any other chemical or substance, shall be securely fastened to the hull of the vessel to prevent their rolling overboard into the lock chamber and becoming a hazard.

    (vi) All containers holding paint, gasoline or other volatile materials shall be securely fastened with tight-fitting covers. To preclude a concentration of potentially explosive vapors, no paint will be allowed to be applied to the exterior of vessel hulls, houses, machinery, or other equipment while the vessels are in the lock chamber.

    (vii) All hatches of tank barges must be closed prior to entering lock. Tank barges with open hatch or hatches will be denied lockage.

    (viii) No smoking will be permitted aboard vessels with cargoes of fuel or explosives.

    (ix) All vessels carrying hazardous cargoes shall so be identified with the lockmaster. They shall be in compliance with Department of Transportation (U.S. Coast Guard) regulations (CFR title 46, parts 30 thru 40, parts 146 thru 154, and 49 CFR parts 171 thru 179 and shall accordingly carry required markings. All DOT safety regulations for transit of hazardous cargoes shall be adhered to, whether or not specifically cited or duplicated herein.

    (7) [Reserved]

    (8)  (i) No log raft exceeding 700 feet in length or 76 feet in width shall pass through the canal. Boom sticks shall be smooth, with rounded ends, and securely tied together with cables, chains, or log swifters to prevent the raft from spreading while in the lock. Rafts containing logs that do not float above water for their entire length, or are in danger of being submerged when they enter fresh water, shall not be towed in the canal until such logs are securely fastened so as to prevent their escape from the raft.

    (ii) Whenever required, log rafts passing in through the lock will be given a number that shall be fastened on one of the logs in the raft. This number will identify the raft and shall not be removed until the logs are used.

    (iii) Two floats are maintained in Shilshole Bay near the entrance of the canal channel to facilitate the handling of logs in the canal. Rafts bound for the canal may be moored at one of these floats, only the portion of the raft that is to be taken through at a single lockage being brought into the canal. The remainder of the raft may be left at the float until the first portion has been towed to its destination above the lock.

    (9)  All vessels engaged in towing shall use tow lines of the least practicable length and shall have full control of their tows at all times. Towing more than one craft abreast is forbidden if the total width of the tow, including the towboat, exceeds 70 feet.

    (10)  (i) All vessels and tows passing through the canal shall be kept as close as practicable to the center or, when safer, to the right side of the waterway, except when passing other craft or preparing to moor at a pier or wharf. Slowly moving log rafts, tows, or vessels shall, whenever practicable, pull out of the way when meeting other vessels or when other traffic proceeding in the same direction desires to pass. Vessels are forbidden to obstruct the canal in any way or to delay by slow passage through the canal the progress of other vessels. Small and readily maneuverable vessels operating in the vicinity of larger, less maneuverable vessels shall, in all cases, keep clear and operate with caution in order that the larger vessels may maintain safe steerage way and that hazards to all vessels may be reduced. All vessels shall operate with extreme caution and movements shall be made only when adequate precautions for the safety of other vessels and property are being effectively employed.

    (ii) The placing of logs, vessels, or other floating objects within the limits of the dredged channels or anywhere in the canal where they may interfere with navigation to or from piers or industrial plants is prohibited.

    (11)  Vessels exceeding 100 feet in length shall not turn around, or attempt to turn around, in the concrete revetted portions of the canal at the Fremont Cut or Portage Cut sections of the canal.

    (12)  Excessive working of the propellers of a vessel for purposes of testing or for other purposes when this creates objectionable or dangerous currents in the canal is forbidden. In case of grounding, the rapid or strong working of the vessel's engines is forbidden.

    (13)  No business, trading, or landing of passengers, freight, or baggage will be allowed on or over the canal piers or lock walls, or over the piers or grounds forming a part of the canal or its appurtenances. All persons in charge of or employed on any boat are prohibited from landing or mooring such boat at any of the canal piers, unless in transit through the canal or specially permitted to do so by the District Engineer or his authorized assistants.

    (14)  The deposit, either from watercraft or from the shore, of any oil or refuse matter in the canal or upon the canal grounds is prohibited, nor shall water discharged from the side of a vessel be allowed to spill on the lock wall.

    (15)  Persons in charge of log rafts or other tows, and the masters of vessels and boats using the canal, shall keep a careful watch when passing buoys or other aids to navigation and promptly report to the District Engineering or his authorized assistants any displacement or damage to such aids.

    (16)  (i) A salt water barrier is installed across the east end of the large lock. This barrier, while in the depressed position, reduces the depth of the water available at the east end of this chamber from 36 feet to 33.75 feet at low lake elevation (20 feet above MLLW). In the raised position, the depth of water will be reduced to 16 feet. In comparison, the depth of water available for navigation at the west end of the large lock chamber is 29 feet at mean lower low water. The purpose of this barrier is to reduce salt water intrusion into Lake Washington through normal operations of the locks.

    (ii) The least depth of water available over the barrier when raised will be shown on signs placed near the ends of the guide piers to the large lock. A yellow light mounted on these signs will be lighted only while the barrier is in a raised position.

    (iii) Vessels transiting the lock from east to west having draft requirements that exceed the water depth available over the barrier will advise the lockmaster by sounding one long and two short blasts of a horn or whistle. When the yellow light is extinguished on the signboard, the operator of the vessel may assume the barrier has been lowered.

    (iv) Vessels transiting the lock from west to east having draft requirements that exceed the depth available over the intrusion barrier will advise the lockmaster by sounding one long and two short blasts of a horn or whistle. A yellow light mounted on a standard on the south lock wall and opposite the intrusion barrier will be lighted only when the barrier is in the raised position.

    (v) It shall be the responsibility of the vessel operator to satisfy himself of the position of this barrier prior to passing over it.

    (c)  (1) The movement of vessels of 250 gross tons or over and all vessels with tows of any kind through the narrow section of West Waterway between the bend at Fisher's Flour Mill dock and the bend at the junction of East Waterway with Duwamish Waterway, and through the draws of the City of Seattle and Northern Pacific Railway Company bridges crossing this narrow section, shall be governed by red and green traffic signal lights mounted on the north and south sides of the west tower of the City Light power crossing at West Spokane Street.

    (2) Two green lights, one vertically above the other, displayed ahead of a vessel, shall indicate that the waterway is clear. Two red lights, one vertically above the other, displayed ahead of a vessel, shall indicate that the waterway is not clear.

    (3) A vessel approaching the narrow section and drawbridges from either end of the waterway shall give one long blast of a whistle and shall not enter the narrow section until green lights are displayed.

    (4) One vessel may follow another vessel in either direction, but the channel shall not be kept open in the same direction for an unreasonable time if a vessel is waiting at the other end.

    (5) Tugs, launches, and small craft shall keep close to one side of the channel when vessels or boats with tows are passing.

    (6) All craft shall proceed with caution. The display of a green light is not a guarantee that the channel is clear of traffic, and neither the United States nor the City of Seattle will be responsible for any damage to vessels or other property which may be chargeable to mistakes in the operation of the signal lights or to their failure to operate.

    (2)  Erection of each movable closure shall be started in sufficient time to permit completion before flood waters reach the top of the structure sill. Information regarding the proper method of erecting each individual closure structure, together with an estimate of the time required by an experienced crew to complete its erection will be given in the Operation and Maintenance Manual which will be furnished local interests upon completion of the project. Closure structures will be inspected frequently during flood periods to ascertain that no undue leakage is occurring and that drains provided to care for ordinary leakage are functioning properly. Boats or floating plant shall not be allowed to tie up to closure structures or to discharge passengers or cargo over them.

    (f) —(1)  _Pumping plants_ shall be inspected by the Superintendent at intervals not to exceed 30 days during flood seasons and 90 days during off-flood seasons to insure that all equipment is in order for instant use. At regular intervals, proper measures shall be taken to provide for cleaning plant, buildings, and equipment, repainting as necessary, and lubricating all machinery. Adequate supplies of lubricants for all types of machines, fuel for gasoline or diesel powered equipment, and flash lights or lanterns for emergency lighting shall be kept on hand at all times. Telephone service shall be maintained at pumping plants. All equipment, including switch gear, transformers, motors, pumps, valves, and gates shall be trial operated and checked at least once every 90 days. Megger tests of all insulation shall be made whenever wiring has been subjected to undue dampness and otherwise at intervals not to exceed one year. A record shall be kept showing the results of such tests. Wiring disclosed to be in an unsatisfactory condition by such tests shall be brought to a satisfactory condition or shall be promptly replaced. Diesel and gasoline engines shall be started at such intervals and allowed to run for such length of time as may be necessary to insure their serviceability in times of emergency. Only skilled electricians and mechanics shall be employed on tests and repairs. Operating personnel for the plant shall be present during tests. Any equipment removed from the station for repair or replacement shall be returned or replaced as soon as practicable and shall be trial operated after reinstallation. Repairs requiring removal of equipment from the plant shall be made during off-flood seasons insofar as practicable.

    (2)  Competent operators shall be on duty at pumping plants whenever it appears that necessity for pump operation is imminent. The operator shall thoroughly inspect, trial operate, and place in readiness all plant equipment. The operator shall be familiar with the equipment manufacturers' instructions and drawings and with the “Operating Instructions” for each station. The equipment shall be operated in accordance with the above-mentioned “Operating Instructions” and care shall be exercised that proper lubrication is being supplied all equipment, and that no overheating, undue vibration or noise is occurring. Immediately upon final recession of flood waters, the pumping station shall be thoroughly cleaned, pump house sumps flushed, and equipment thoroughly inspected, oiled and greased. A record or log of pumping plant operation shall be kept for each station, a copy of which shall be furnished the District Engineer following each flood.

    (g) —(1)  Periodic inspections of improved channels and floodways shall be made by the Superintendent to be certain that:

    (i) The channel or floodway is clear of debris, weeds, and wild growth;

    (ii) The channel or floodway is not being restricted by the depositing of waste materials, building of unauthorized structures or other encroachments;

    (iii) The capacity of the channel or floodway is not being reduced by the formation of shoals;

    (iv) Banks are not being damaged by rain or wave wash, and that no sloughing of banks has occurred;

    (v) Riprap sections and deflection dikes and walls are in good condition;

    (vi) Approach and egress channels adjacent to the improved channel or floodway are sufficiently clear of obstructions and debris to permit proper functioning of the project works.

    (2)  Both banks of the channel shall be patrolled during periods of high water, and measures shall be taken to protect those reaches being attacked by the current or by wave wash. Appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent the formation of jams of ice or debris. Large objects which become lodged against the bank shall be removed. The improved channel or floodway shall be thoroughly inspected immediately following each major high water period. As soon as practicable thereafter, all snags and other debris shall be removed and all damage to banks, riprap, deflection dikes and walls, drainage outlets, or other flood control structures repaired.

    (h) —(1)  Miscellaneous structures and facilities constructed as a part of the protective works and other structures and facilities which function as a part of, or affect the efficient functioning of the protective works, shall be periodically inspected by the Superintendent and appropriate maintenance measures taken. Damaged or unserviceable parts shall be repaired or replaced without delay. Areas used for ponding in connection with pumping plants or for temporary storage of interior run-off during flood periods shall not be allowed to become filled with silt, debris, or dumped material. The Superintendent shall take proper steps to prevent restriction of bridge openings and, where practicable, shall provide for temporary raising during floods of bridges which restrict channel capacities during high flows.

    § 208.11   Regulations for use of storage allocated for flood control or navigation and/or project operation at reservoirs subject to prescription of rules and regulations by the Secretary of the Army in the interest of flood control and navigation.

#### § § 208.11

    (a)  This regulation prescribes the responsibilities and general procedures for regulating reservoir projects capable of regulation for flood control or navigation and the use of storage allocated for such purposes and provided on the basis of flood control and navigation, except projects owned and operated by the Corps of Engineers; the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico; and those under the jurisdiction of the International Joint Commission, United States, and Canada, and the Columbia River Treaty. The intent of this regulation is to establish an understanding between project owners, operating agencies, and the Corps of Engineers.

    (b)  The basic responsibilities of the Corps of Engineers regarding project operation are set out in the cited authority and described in the following paragraphs:

    (1) Section 7 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 890, 33 U.S.C. 709) directs the Secretary of the Army to prescribe regulations for flood control and navigation in the following manner:

    (2) Section 9 of Public Law 436-83d Congress (68 Stat. 303) provides for the development of the Coosa River, Alabama and Georgia, and directs the Secretary of the Army to prescribe rules and regulations for project operation in the interest of flood control and navigation as follows:

    (3) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), formerly Federal Power Commission (FPC), Licenses.

    (i) Responsibilities of the Secretary of the Army and/or the Chief of Engineers in FERC licensing actions are set forth in reference 3c above and pertinent sections are cited herein. The Commission may further stipulate as a licensing condition, that a licensee enter into an agreement with the Department of the Army providing for operation of the project during flood times, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.

    (A) Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act requires approval by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army of plans of dams or other structures affecting the navigable capacity of any navigable waters of the United States, prior to issuance of a license by the Commission as follows:

    (B) Sections 10(a) and 10(c) of the Federal Power Act specify conditions of project licenses including the following:

    (1)  “That the project adopted * * * shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of waterpower development, and for other beneficial public uses * * *.”

    (2)  “That the licensee shall * * * so maintain and operate said works as not to impair navigation, and shall conform to such rules and regulations as the Commission may from time to time prescribe for the protection of life, health, and property * * *.”

    (C) Section 18 of the Federal Power Act directs the operation of any navigation facilities built under the provision of that Act, be controlled by rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army as follows:

    (ii) Federal Power Commission Order No. 540 issued October 31, 1975, and published November 7, 1975 (40 FR 51998), amending § 2.9 of the Commission's General Policy and Interpretations prescribed Standardized Conditions (Forms) for Inclusion in Preliminary Permits and Licenses Issued Under part I of the Federal Power Act. As an example, Article 12 of Standard Form L-3, titled: “Terms and Conditions of License for Constructed Major Projects Affecting Navigable Waters of the United States,” sets forth the Commission's interpretation of appropriate sections of the Act, which deal with navigation aspects, and attendant responsibilities of the Secretary of the Army in licensing actions as follows:

    (c)  This regulation applies to Federal authorized flood control and/or navigation storage projects, and to non-Federal projects which require the Secretary of the Army to prescribe regulations as a condition of the license, permit or legislation, during the planning, design and construction phases, and throughout the life of the project. In compliance with the authority cited above, this regulation defines certain activities and responsibilities concerning water control management throughout the Nation in the interest of flood control and navigation. In carrying out the conditions of this regulation, the owner and/or operating agency will comply with applicable provisions of Pub. L. 85-624, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, and Pub. L. 92-500, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. This regulation does not apply to local flood protection works governed by § 208.10, or to navigation facilities and associated structures which are otherwise covered by part 207 (Navigation Regulations) of title 33 of the code. Small reservoirs, containing less than 12,500 acre-feet of flood control or navigation storage, may be excluded from this regulation and covered under § 208.10, unless specifically required by law or conditions of the license or permit.

    (1) The terms  and  as used herein include all water resource impoundment _project_s constructed or modified, including natural lakes, that are subject to this regulation.

    (2) The term  refers to the entity responsible for maintenance, physical operation, and safety of the project, and for carrying out the water control plan in the interest of flood control and/or navigation as prescribed by the Corps of Engineers. Special arrangements may be made by the _project owner_ for “operating agencies” to perform these tasks.

    (3) The term  as used herein includes statements which consummate this regulation for any given project and define the general provisions or conditions of the local sponsor, or owner, cooperation agreed to in the authorizing legislative document, and the requirements for compliance with section 7 of the 1944 Flood Control Act, the Federal Power Act or other special congressional act. This information will be specified in the water control plan and manual. The _letter of understanding_ will be signed by a duly authorized representative of the Chief of Engineers and the project owner. A “field working agreement” may be substituted for a letter of understanding, provided that the specified minimum requirements of the latter, as stated above, are met.

    (4) The term  refers to a compliation of water control criteria, guidelines, diagrams, release schedules, rule curves and specifications that basically govern the use of reservoir storage space allocated for flood control or navigation and/or release functions of a water control project for these purposes. In general, they indicate controlling or limiting rates of discharge and storage space required for flood control and/or navigation, based on the runoff potential during various seasons of the year.

    (5) For the purpose of this regulation, the term  is limited to the plan of regulation for a water resources project in the interest of flood control and/or navigation. The _water control plan_ must conform with proposed allocations of storage capacity and downstream conditions or other requirements to meet all functional objectives of the particular project, acting separately or in combination with other projects in a system.

    (6) The term  denotes the processing of current information or data in a sufficiently timely manner to influence a physical response in the system being monitored and controlled. As used herein the term connotes * * * the analyses for and execution of water control decisions for both minor and major flood events and for navigation, based on prevailing hydrometeorological and other conditions and constraints, to achieve efficient management of water resource systems.

    (d) —(1)  During the planning and design phases, the project owner should consult with the Corps of Engineers regarding the quantity and value of space to reserve in the reservoir for flood control and/or navigation purposes, and for utilization of the space, and other requirements of the license, permit or conditions of the law. Relevant matters that bear upon flood control and navigation accomplishment include: Runoff potential, reservoir discharge capability, downstream channel characteristics, hydrometeorological data collection, flood hazard, flood damage characteristics, real estate acquisition for flowage requirements (fee and easement), and resources required to carry out the water control plan. Advice may also be sought on determination of and regulation for the probable maximum or other design flood under consideration by the project owner to establish the quantity of surcharge storage space, and freeboard elevation of top of dam or embankment for safety of the project.

    (2)  If the project owner is responsible for real-time implementation of the water control plan, consultation and assistance will be provided by the Corps of Engineers when appropriate and to the extent possible. During any emergency that affects flood control and/or navigation, the Corps of Engineers may temporarily prescribe regulation of flood control or navigation storage space on a day-to-day (real-time) basis without request of the project owner. Appropriate consideration will be given for other authorized project functions. Upon refusal of the project owner to comply with regulations prescribed by the Corps of Engineers, a letter will be sent to the project owner by the Chief of Engineers or his duly authorized representative describing the reason for the regulations prescribed, events that have transpired, and notification that the project owner is in violation of the Code of Federal Regulations. Should an impasse arise, in that the project owner or the designated operating entity persists in noncompliance with regulations prescribed by the Corps of Engineers, measures may be taken to assure compliance.

    (3)  The Corps of Engineers may prescribe the continuing regulation of flood control storage space for any project subject to this regulation on a day-to-day (real-time) basis. When this is the case, consultation and assistance from the project owner to the extent possible will be expected. Special requests by the project owner, or appropriate operating entity, are preferred before the Corps of Engineers offers advice on real-time regulation during surcharge storage utilization.

    (4)  Prior to project completion, water control managers from the Corps of Engineers will visit the project and the area served by the project to become familiar with the water control facilities, and to insure sound formulation of the water control plan. The formal plan of regulation for flood control and/or navigation, referred to herein as the water control plan, will be developed and documented in a water control manual prepared by the Corps of Engineers. Development of the manual will be coordinated with the project owner to obtain the necessary pertinent information, and to insure compatibility with other project purposes and with surcharge regulation. Major topics in the manual will include: Authorization and description of the project, hydrometeorology, data collection and communication networks, hydrologic forecasting, the water control plan, and water resource management functions, including responsibilities and coordination for water control decisionmaking. Special instructions to the dam tender or reservoir manager on data collection, reporting to higher Federal authority, and on procedures to be followed in the event of a communication outage under emergency conditions, will be prepared as an exhibit in the manual. Other exhibits will include copies of this regulation, letters of understanding consummating this regulation, and the water control agreements. After approval by the Chief of Engineers or his duly authorized representative, the manual will be furnished the project owner.

    (5)  (i) A water control diagram (graphical) will be prepared by the Corps of Engineers for each project having variable space reservation for flood control and/or navigation during the year; e.g., variable seasonal storage, joint-use space, or other rule curve designation. Reservoir inflow parameters will be included on the diagrams when appropriate. Concise notes will be included on the diagrams prescribing the use of storage space in terms of release schedules, runoff, nondamaging or other controlling flow rates downstream of the damsite, and other major factors as appropriate. A water control release schedule will be prepared in tabular form for projects that do not have variable space reservation for flood control and/or navigation. The water control diagram or release schedule will be signed by a duly authorized representative of the Chief of Engineers, the project owner, and the designated operating agency, and will be used as the basis for carrying out this regulation. Each diagram or schedule will contain a reference to this regulation.

    (ii) When deemed necessary by the Corps of Engineers, information given on the water control diagram or release schedule will be supplemented by appropriate text to assure mutual understanding on certain details or other important aspects of the water control plan not covered in this regulation, on the water control diagram or in the release schedule. This material will include clarification of any aspects that might otherwise result in unsatisfactory project performance in the interest of flood control and/or navigation. Supplementation of the agreement will be necessary for each project where the Corps of Engineers exercises the discretionary authority to prescribe the flood control regulation on a day-to-day (real-time) basis. The agreement will include delegation of the responsibility. The document should also cite, as appropriate, section 7 of the 1944 Flood Control Act, the Federal Power Act and/or other congressional legislation authorizing construction and/or directing operation of the project.

    (iii) All flood control regulations published in the  under this section (part 208) of the code prior to the date of this publication which are listed in § 208.11(e) are hereby superseded.

    (iv) Nothing in this regulation prohibits the promulgation of specific regulations for a project in compliance with the authorizing acts, when agreement on acceptable regulations cannot be reached between the Corps of Engineers and the owner.

    (6)  The project owner will provide instrumentation in the vicinity of the damsite and will provide communication equipment necessary to record and transmit hydrometeorological and reservoir data to all appropriate Federal authorities on a real-time basis unless there are extenuating circumstances or are otherwise provided for as a condition of the license or permit. For those projects where the owner retains responsibility for real-time implementation of the water control plan, the owner will also provide or arrange for the measurement and reporting of hydrometeorological parameters required within and adjacent to the watershed and downstream of the damsite, sufficient to regulate the project for flood control and/or navigation in an efficient manner. When data collection stations outside the immediate vicinity of the damsite are required, and funds for installation, observation, and maintenance are not available from other sources, the Corps of Engineers may agree to share the costs for such stations with the project owner. Availability of funds and urgency of data needs are factors which will be considered in reaching decisions on cost sharing.

    (7)  The project owner is responsible for the safety of the dam and appurtenant facilities and for regulation of the project during surcharge storage utilization. Emphasis upon the safety of the dam is especially important in the event surcharge storage is utilized, which results when the total storage space reserved for flood control is exceeded. Any assistance provided by the Corps of Engineers concerning surcharge regulation is to be utilized at the discretion of the project owner, and does not relieve the owner of the responsibility for safety of the project.

    (8)  The Corps of Engineers and other interested Federal and State agencies, and the project owner will jointly sponsor public involvement activities, as appropriate, to fully apprise the general public of the water control plan. Public meetings or other effective means of notification and involvement will be held, with the initial meeting being conducted as early as practicable but not later than the time the project first becomes operational. Notice of the initial public meeting shall be published once a week for 3 consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation published in each county covered by the water control plan. Such notice shall also be used when appropriate to inform the public of modifications in the water control plan. If no newspaper is published in a county, the notice shall be published in one or more newspapers of general circulation within that county. For the purposes of this section a newspaper is one qualified to publish public notices under applicable State law. Notice shall be given in the event significant problems are anticipated or experienced that will prevent carrying out the approved water control plan or in the event that an extreme water condition is expected that could produce severe damage to property or loss of life. The means for conveying this information shall be commensurate with the urgency of the situation. The water control manual will be made available for examination by the general public upon request at the appropriate office of the Corps of Engineers, project owner or designated operating agency.

    (9)  (i) Storage space in the reservoirs allocated for flood control and navigation purposes shall be kept available for those purposes in accordance with the water control agreement, and the plan of regulation in the water control manual.

    (ii) Any water impounded in the flood control space defined by the water control agreement shall be evacuated as rapidly as can be safely accomplished without causing downstream flows to exceed the controlling rates; , releases from reservoirs shall be restricted insofar as practicable to quantities which, in conjunction with uncontrolled runoff downstream of the dam, will not cause water levels to exceed the controlling stages currently in force. Although conflicts may arise with other purposes, such as hydropower, the plan or regulation may require releases to be completely curtailed in the interest of flood control or safety of the project.

    (iii) Nothing in the plan of regulation for flood control shall be construed to require or allow dangerously rapid changes in magnitudes of releases. Releases will be made in a manner consistent with requirements for protecting the dam and reservoir from major damage during passage of the maximum design flood for the project.

    (iv) The project owner shall monitor current reservoir and hydro- meteorological conditions in and adjacent to the watershed and downstream of the damsite, as necessary. This and any other pertinent information shall be reported to the Corps of Engineers on a timely basis, in accordance with standing instructions to the damtender or other means requested by the Corps of Engineers.

    (v) In all cases where the project owner retains responsibility for real-time implementation of the water control plan, he shall make current determinations of: Reservoir inflow, flood control storage utilized, and scheduled releases. He shall also determine storage space and releases required to comply with the water control plan prescribed by the Corps of Engineers. The owner shall report this information on a timely basis as requested by the Corps of Engineers.

    (vi) The water control plan is subject to temporary modification by the Corps of Engineers if found necessary in time of emergency. Requests for and action on such modifications may be made by the fastest means of communication available. The action taken shall be confirmed in writing the same day to the project owner and shall include justification for the action.

    (vii) The project owner may temporarily deviate from the water control plan in the event an immediate short-term departure is deemed necessary for emergency reasons to protect the safety of the dam, or to avoid other serious hazards. Such actions shall be immediately reported by the fastest means of communication available. Actions shall be confirmed in writing the same day to the Corps of Engineers and shall include justification for the action. Continuation of the deviation will require the express approval of the Chief of Engineers, or his duly authorized representative.

    (viii) Advance approval of the Chief of Engineers, or his duly authorized representative, is required prior to any deviation from the plan of regulation prescribed or approved by the Corps of Engineers in the interest of flood control and/or navigation, except in emergency situations provided for in paragraph (d)(9)(vii) of this section. When conditions appear to warrant a prolonged deviation from the approved plan, the project owner and the Corps of Engineers will jointly investigate and evaluate the proposed deviation to insure that the overall integrity of the plan would not be unduly compromised. Approval of prolonged deviations will not be granted unless such investigations and evaluations have been conducted to the extent deemed necessary by the Chief of Engineers, or his designated representatives, to fully substantiate the deviation.

    (10)  The water control plan and all associated documents will be revised by the Corps of Engineers as necessary, to reflect changed conditions that come to bear upon flood control and navigation, e.g., reallocation of reservoir storage space due to sedimentation or transfer of storage space to a neighboring project. Revision of the water control plan, water control agreement, water control diagram, or release schedule requires approval of the Chief of Engineers or his duly authorized representative. Each such revision shall be effective upon the date specified in the approval. The original (signed document) water control agreement shall be kept on file in the respective Office the Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, located at division offices throughout the continental USA. Copies of these agreements may be obtained from the office of the project owner, or from the office of the appropriate Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers.

    (11)  The following information for each project subject to section 7 of the 1944 Flood Control Act and other applicable congressional acts shall be published in the  prior to the time the projects becomes operational and prior to any significant impoundment before project completion or * * * at such time as the responsibility for physical operation and maintenance of the Corps of Engineers owned projects is transferred to another entity:

    (i) Reservoir, dam, and lake names,

    (ii) Stream, county, and State corresponding to the damsite location,

    (iii) The maximum current storage space in acre-feet to be reserved exclusively for flood control and/or navigation purposes, or any multiple-use space (intermingled) when flood control or navigation is one of the purposes, with corresponding elevations in feet above mean sea level, and area in acres, at the upper and lower limits of said space,

    (iv) The name of the project owner, and

    (v) Congressional legislation authorizing the project for Federal participation.

    (e)  The following tables, “Pertinent Project Data—Section 208.11 Regulation,” show the pertinent data for projects which are subject to this regulation.

    § 208.22   Twin Buttes Dam and Reservoir, Middle and South Concho Rivers, Tex.

#### § § 208.22

    The Bureau of Reclamation, or its designated agent, shall operate the Twin Buttes Dam and Reservoir in the interest of flood control as follows:

    (a) Whenever the Twin Buttes Reservoir level is between elevations 1,940.2 (top of conservation pool) and elevation 1,969.1 (top of flood control pool) the flood control discharge facilities shall be operated under the direction of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, so as to reduce as much as practicable the flood damage below the reservoir. All flood control releases shall be made in amounts which, when combined with releases from San Angelo Reservoir on the North Concho River and local inflow below the dam, will not produce flows in excess of bankful capacities on the South Concho and Concho Rivers downstream of the reservoir. In order to accomplish this purpose, flows shall not exceed a 22.5-foot stage (25,000 c.f.s.) on the USGS gage on the Concho River near San Angelo, Tex. (river mile 60.9); or a 22.8-foot stage (25,000 c.f.s.) on the USGS gage near Paint Rock, Tex. (river mile 19.6).

    (b) When the Twin Buttes Reservoir level exceeds elevation 1,969.1 (top of flood control pool), releases shall be made at the maximum rate possible and continued until the pool elevation recedes to elevation 1,969.1 when releases shall be made to equal inflow or the maximum release permissible under paragraph (a) of this section, whichever is greater.

    (c) The representative of the Bureau of Reclamation in immediate charge of operation of the Twin Buttes Dam shall furnish daily to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, a report, on forms provided by the District Engineer for this purpose, showing (1) for Twin Buttes Reservoir, the elevation of the reservoir level; number of river outlet works gates in operation with their respective openings and releases; uncontrolled spillway releases; storage; reservoir inflow; available evaporation data; and precipitation in inches; and (2) for Nasworthy Reservoir, the elevation of the reservoir level; irrigation outlet works and controlled spillway releases; storage; tailwater elevation; and reservoir inflow. Normally, one reading at 8 a.m. shall be shown for each day. Readings of all items except evaporation shall be shown for at least three observations a day when the Twin Buttes Reservoir level is above elevation 1,940.2. Whenever the Twin Buttes Reservoir level rises to elevation 1,940.2 and releases for flood regulation are necessary or appear imminent, the Bureau representative shall report at once to the District Engineer by telephone or telegraph and, unless otherwise instructed, shall report once daily thereafter in that manner until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1,940.2. These latter reports shall reach the District Engineer by 9 a.m. each day.

    (d) The regulations of this section insofar as they govern use of the flood control storage capacity in Twin Buttes Reservoir above elevation 1,940.2 are subject to temporary modification in time of flood by the District Engineer, if found desirable on the basis of conditions at the time. Such desired modifications shall be communicated to the representative of the Bureau of Reclamation in immediate charge of operations of the Twin Buttes Dam by any available means of communication and shall be confirmed in writing under date of the same day to the Regional Director in charge of the locality, with a copy to the representative in charge of the Twin Buttes Dam.

    (e) Flood control operation shall not restrict releases necessary for municipal, industrial, and irrigation uses.

    (f) Releases made in accordance with the regulations of this section are subject to the condition that releases shall not be made at rates or in a manner that would be inconsistent with emergency requirements for protecting the Twin Buttes Dam and Reservoir from major damage or inconsistent with safe routing of the inflow design flood (spillway design flood).

    (g) The discharge characteristics of the river outlet works (capable of discharging approximately 32,470 c.f.s. with the reservoir level at elevation 1,969.1) shall be maintained in accordance with the construction plans (Bureau of Reclamation Specifications No. DC-5274 as modified by revised drawings and criteria in Designers' Operating Criteria, Twin Buttes Dam, dated February 1963).

    (h) All elevations stated in this section are at Twin Buttes Dam and are referred to the datum in use at that location.

#### § § 208.25

    The representative of the agency charged with the operation of the Pensacola Dam, referred to in this section as the Representative shall operate the dam and reservoir in the interest of flood control as follows:

    (a) Whenever the pool stage exceeds elevation 745 at the dam, the discharge facilities shall be operated under the direction of the District Engineer, Engineer Department at Large, in charge of the locality, so as to reduce as much as practicable the flood damage below the reservoir and to limit the pool stage to elevation 755 at the dam.

    (b) The District Engineer will advise the Representative when inflow rates are anticipated which will raise the pool above elevation 745 at the dam. The District Engineer will also advise the Representative of essential increase in the flood control storage capacity of the reservoir which should be provided by drawing the pool down below elevation 745 at the dam in order to obtain maximum flood control benefits, with the provision that the suggested reduction in power storage shall at no time exceed the replacement volume of flow then in sight in the streams above the reservoir.

    (c) The Representative shall furnish the District Engineer, daily, a report showing the elevation of the reservoir pool and the tailwater, number of gates in operation, spillway and turbine releases, evaporation, storage, reservoir inflow, and precipitation in inches as shown by Agency gages. One reading shall be shown for each day with additional readings of releases for all changes in spillway gate operation, and with readings of all items except evaporation three times daily when the District Engineer advises the Representative that flood conditions are imminent. By agreement between the Representative and the District Engineer, any of the foregoing information may be furnished by telephone and may, if agreed upon, be omitted from the report. Whenever the pool is above elevation 745 at the dam the Representative shall submit additional reports by telegraph or telephone as directed by the District Engineer, with a report to be furnished immediately whenever the pool rises above elevation 745 at the dam.

    (d) The District Engineer will furnish the Representative with all available information and detailed instructions for operation of the reservoir in the interest of flood control during an emergency condition when communications between the dam and the District Office are broken. In the event that the District Engineer or his authorized representative cannot be reached by telephone, telegraph or by other means during a flood emergency, these instructions will govern. The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section will govern at all times except during such an emergency.

    (e) Elevations stated in this section are referred to Pensacola datum which is 1.07 feet below mean sea level.

    The Bureau of Reclamation, or its designated agent, shall operate the Altus Dam and Reservoir in the interest of flood control as follows:

    (a) Flood control storage in the reservoir between elevation 1559 (top of conservation pool) and elevation 1562 (top of flood control pool) amounts to 21,448 acre-feet (based on 1953 sedimentation survey). Whenever the reservoir level is within this elevation range, the flood control discharge facilities shall be operated under the direction of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, so as to reduce as much as practicable the flood damage below the dam, and to limit the reservoir level to elevation 1562 when possible.

    (b) When the reservoir level is below elevation 1559 and the predicted volume of runoff from the area above the dam exceeds the volume of water necessary to raise the reservoir level above elevation 1559, the reservoir will be operated to obtain maximum overall benefits which may consist of preflood releases:  That all preflood releases will have prior concurrence of the Bureau of Reclamation or its designated agent. The preflood releases shall not result in a reservoir level below elevation 1559 at the end of the flood.

    (c) When the reservoir level exceeds elevation 1559, releases will be made equal to inflow or 2,000 c.f.s., whichever is smaller, except that when the reservoir elevation forecast indicates that this operation will result in a reservoir level exceeding elevation 1562, releases will be increased in order to provide maximum overall benefits and prevent the reservoir level from exceeding elevation 1562, insofar as possible. The flood control pool will be emptied by continuing the peak discharge rate until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559, at which time releases will be made equal to inflow.

    (d) If the reservoir level exceeds elevation 1562 (top of flood control pool) releases shall be made at the maximum rate possible through the spillway gates, conduit, and the uncontrolled spillway and continued until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559, at which time releases will be made equal to inflow.

    (e) Whenever the reservoir level is above elevation 1559 and communication with the Bureau of Reclamation Regional Office and the Corps of Engineers District Office is unobtainable, releases shall be made equal to inflow until all gates are fully open. The maximum release thus obtained shall be maintained until the pool recedes to elevation 1559 at which time releases shall be made to equal inflow.

    (f) The representative of the Bureau of Reclamation, or its designated agent, in immediate charge of the operation of Altus Dam will furnish daily to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, a report on forms provided by the District for this purpose, showing the reservoir pool elevation; the number of spillway gates in operation with their respective opening and releases; the uncontrolled spillway release; conduit, canal outlet wasteway, and irrigation releases; storage; reservoir inflow; available evaporation data; and precipitation in inches. A reading at 8 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., and midnight, shall be shown for each day. Whenever the reservoir level rises to elevation 1559 and releases for flood control regulation are necessary or appear imminent, the representative of the Bureau of Reclamation or its designated agent, shall report at once to the District Engineer by telephone or telegraph and, unless otherwise instructed, shall report at 8 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. thereafter, in that manner, until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559. These latter reports shall reach the District Engineer by 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. each day.

    (g) The regulations of this section, insofar as they govern use of the flood control storage capacity above elevation 1559 are subject to temporary modification by the District Engineer in time of flood, if found desirable on the basis of conditions at the time. Such desired modifications shall be coordinated with and approved by the Bureau of Reclamation.

    (h) Flood control operation shall not restrict releases necessary for irrigation, municipal, and industrial uses.

    (i) Releases made in accordance with the regulations of this section are subject to the conditions that releases shall not be made at rates or in a manner that would be inconsistent with emergency requirements for protecting the dam and reservoir from major damage.

    (j) Any time that the Bureau of Reclamation determines that operation in accordance with the regulations of this section will jeopardize the safety of Altus Dam, they will so advise the District Engineer and will assume operational responsibility and take action necessary to assure the safety of the dam.

    (k) The discharge characteristics of the controlled and the uncontrolled spillways (capable of discharging approximately 42,800 c.f.s. and 2,000 c.f.s., respectively, with the reservoir level at elevation 1562) shall be maintained in accordance with the construction plans (Bureau of Reclamation Drawing No. 258-D-69).

    (l) All elevations stated in this section are at Altus Dam and are referred to the datum in use at that location.

    (c) Storage space in Cherry Valley Reservoir shall be kept available for flood-control purposes in accordance with the Flood-Control Reservation Diagram currently in force for that reservoir except when storage of floodwater is necessary as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section. The Flood-Control Storage Reservoir Diagram in force as of the promulgation of this section is that dated April 4, 1956, File No. TU-2-26-6, and is on file in the Office, Chief of Engineers, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., and in the office of the Public Utilities Commission of the City and County of San Francisco, California. Revisions of the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagram may be developed from time to time as necessary by the Corps of Engineers and the City. Each such revision shall be effective upon the date specified in the approval thereof by the Chief of Engineers and by the Public Utilities Commission of the City and County of San Francisco, California, and from that date until replaced shall be the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagram currently in force for the purpose of this section. Copies of the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagram currently in force shall be kept on file in and may be obtained from the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in charge of the locality, and the office of the Public Utilities Commission of the City and County of San Francisco, California.

    (d) Any water temporarily stored in the flood-control space indicated by the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagram currently in force for Don Pedro Reservoir shall be released as rapidly as can be accomplished without causing flows in Tuolumne River below LaGrange Dam to exceed 7,000 c.f.s. during rain floods or to exceed 9,000 c.f.s. at all other times.

    (e) Any water temporarily stored in the flood-control space indicated by the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagrams currently in force for Hetch Hetchy and Cherry Valley Reservoirs shall be released as rapidly as can be accomplished without exceeding the respective safe channel capacities, and without materially contributing to major encroachment into the flood-control space at Don Pedro Reservoir. Such releases shall be proportioned between Hetch Hetchy and Cherry Valley Reservoirs in such manner as to assure that the percentage of encroachment into the flood-control space at the two reservoirs will tend toward equality insofar as possible. Whenever the storage space in Don Pedro Reservoir is less than 90 percent of that indicated by the Flood-Control Storage Reservation Diagram currently in force for that reservoir, releases from Hetch Hetchy and Cherry Valley Reservoirs shall be restricted to those required in connection with the generation of hydroelectric power in the power system of the City and in connection with diversion into the water supply system of the City.

    (f) In the event that the water level in Don Pedro Reservoir rises above elevation 605.55 at the dam (top of spillway gates), subsequent operation of the dam shall be such as to cause downstream flows to exceed as little as possible the criteria prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, and in no event to cause the maximum subsequent release from the reservoir to exceed the estimated maximum subsequent inflow to the reservoir.

    (g) In the event that the water level in Hetch Hetchy Reservoir rises above elevation 3806 at the dam (top of spillway gates), subsequent operation of the dam shall be such as to cause downstream flows to exceed as little as possible the criteria prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, and in no event to cause the maximum subsequent release from the reservoir to exceed the estimated maximum subsequent inflow to the reservoir.

    (h) In the event that the water level in Cherry Valley Reservoir rises above elevation 4700 at the dam (spillway crest), subsequent operation of the dam shall be such as to cause downstream flows to exceed as little as possible the criteria prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, and in no event to cause the maximum subsequent release from the reservoir to exceed the estimated maximum subsequent inflow to the reservoir.

    (i) Nothing in the regulations of this section shall be construed to require dangerously rapid changes in magnitudes of releases from any of the reservoirs.

    (j) The Districts shall procure such current basic hydrologic data, make such current determinations of required flood-control storage reservation in Don Pedro Reservoir, and current calculations of permissible releases from Don Pedro Reservoir as are required to accomplish the flood-control objectives of the regulations of this section.

    (k) The City shall procure such current basic hydrologic data, and make such current calculations of permissible releases from Hetch Hetchy and Cherry Valley Reservoirs as are required to accomplish the flood-control objectives of the regulations of this section.

    (l) The City shall keep the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in charge of the locality, and the Districts currently advised of reservoir releases, reservoir storages, basic operating criteria which affect the schedule of operations, and such other operating data as the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, may request for Hetch Hetchy, Eleanor, and Cherry Valley Reservoirs.

    (m) The Districts shall keep the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in charge of the locality, and the City currently advised of reservoir releases, reservoir storages, basic operating criteria which affect the schedule of operations, and such other operating data as the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, may request for Don Pedro Reservoir.

    (n) The flood-control regulations of this section are subject to temporary modification by the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, if found necessary in time of flood emergency. Request for and action on such modifications may be made by any available means of communication, and such action shall be confirmed in writing under date of same day to the operating agency for the reservoir affected.

    § 209.140   Operations of the Corps of Engineers under the Federal Power Act.

#### § § 209.140

    (a)  This section outlines policies and procedures applicable to those operations in which the Corps of Engineers may be called upon to participate under the Federal Power Act. Such operations include: Investigations and reports on applications for permits and licenses for development of power affecting navigable waters; supervision of investigations, construction, and operation of projects under such permits and licenses; preparation of special reports as required by the Federal Power Commission; and review of plans of dams or other structures affecting navigation. The foregoing functions are performed by the Corps of Engineers only upon request of the Federal Power Commission.

    (b)  Section 2 of the revised Federal Power Act provides that the Federal Power Commission may request the President to detail an officer or officers from the Corps of Engineers, or other branches of the United States Army, to serve the Commission as Engineer officer or officers, or in any other capacity, in field work outside the seat of government, their duties to be prescribed by the Commission. By authority of the Secretary of the Army, and in accordance with the instructions issued by the President in a letter to the Secretary of the Army dated May 18, 1931, Division Engineers will be detailed to serve the Commission as engineer officers in field work outside the seat of government, their duties to be prescribed by the Commission, and to be performed under the supervision of the Chief of Engineers. District Engineers will be designated to carry out the field inspections and investigations under supervision of the Division Engineer. When a Division Engineer is detailed by the Chief of Engineers to assist the Commission in either the investigation or supervision of a project he will be the accredited representative of the Commission. The actual field work will be done by the designated District Engineer who will make a report to the Division Engineer. All reports and such correspondence as would normally be forwarded to the Commission will be addressed to the Chief of Engineers.

    (c)  (1) Upon request by the Federal Power Commission, the Chief of Engineers will assign the investigation of an application for permit or license under the Federal Power Act to a Division Engineer, who will submit a report on the investigation as provided herein. The date that the report is to be submitted will be specified. The Division Engineer, upon assignment of an investigation involving extensive studies, will when requested by the Chief of Engineers submit an estimate of the cost of the investigation, listing the probable expenditures for salaries separate from the estimated costs of non-personal services.

    (2) If in the investigation of an application or a declaration of intention filed under the Federal Power Act the Division Engineer considers a public hearing desirable in the interests of navigation or flood control, the Chief of Engineers will be notified whereupon the matter will be brought to the attention of the Commission. No public hearing will be held unless specifically authorized by the Commission or by the Chief of Engineers. If a hearing is authorized it will be limited strictly to consideration of the purpose for which approval is granted.

    (3) The report will describe and discuss material facts having a definite bearing on the interests of navigation and flood control and the general effect the project would have on a comprehensive plan of developing the water resources of the basin. Specific reference will be made to pertinent published documents containing the results of studies and/or resolutions directing studies to be made. In the case of an application for permit or license for an unconstructed project the report will include a recommendation as to whether development should be undertaken by the United States rather than by a licensee. A recommendation for Federal development will be supported by a showing as to how this would serve the Corps of Engineers programs and policies. In the case of an application for permit or license for a constructed project the report should contain appropriate comments concerning possible redevelopment to improve the usefulness of the project in relation to the objectives of the Corps program in the basin.

    (4) The report on an application for license will contain recommendations of the Division Engineer concerning the inclusion in the license of any terms and conditions that are considered to be necessary or desirable in the public interest from the standpoint of Corps of Engineers responsibilities.

    (5) The report on an application for permit will contain such recommendations as required to insure coordination of the applicant's studies with the Division or District Engineer in cases where interests of the Corps of Engineers are involved. In all cases, the report will contain, in lieu of specific recommendations, a discussion of interests which should be protected by articles in a license issued subsequent to the permit period.

    (6) If the project is on a Federal reservation or contemplates the use of a dam, either of which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, the report should state, giving reasons:

    (i) Whether the project will interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which such reservation was created or acquired and what conditions, if any, should be imposed for the adequate protection and utilization of the reservation.

    (ii) Whether the dam may be advantageously used by the United States for public purposes in addition to authorized purposes and whether it should be reserved for such use.

    (iii) Whether the development should be undertaken by the United States.

    (7) The reports will not be released or made public except by specific authority of the Chief of Engineers, nor will copies of a report, its findings, or recommendations be furnished to the applicant, to interested parties, or to the Commission until released by the Chief of Engineers.

    (d)  (1) When supervision of the operations of an applicant under a permit or a license is requested by the Federal Power Commission, the Chief of Engineers will assign responsibility for supervision to the Division Engineer. The operations to be supervised, such as investigations being conducted by a permittee, construction of a project under a license or operation of completed projects, will be as specified by the Commission.

    (2) Projects will be classified as major, minor, minor part or transmission line projects as indicated in the Federal Power Act and as specified in the instructions from the Commission.

    (3) Inspection during the construction of a major project will be made monthly, or as often as may be necessary for the Division Engineer to assure himself that the terms of the license are being complied with and the work is of acceptable quality and in accordance with the approved plans. The frequency of inspections of minor, minor part, and transmission line projects is left to the discretion of the Division Engineer.

    (4) After a project has been completed and placed in operation and is under the supervision of the Division Engineer, annual inspection will be made of major and minor projects but inspection of transmission line projects will not be made unless specifically requested by the Commission.

    (5) Reports on supervision and inspections of operations under Federal Power Commission permits and licenses will be submitted in accordance with instructions in paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e)  Periodic reports, as appropriate to assigned responsibilities and as described in paragraphs (e) (1) through (3), inclusive, of this section will be submitted for each Federal Power Commission permit or license for which a Division Engineer has been assigned responsibility for supervision of operations under provisions of the Federal Power Act. All of the described reports will be submitted in triplicate to the Chief of Engineers for transmittal to the Federal Power Commission. Unless otherwise stated transmittal letters will not be required and the reports will be mailed so as to reach the Chief of Engineers not later than the 15th of the month following the end of the report period.

    (1)  When a Division Engineer is assigned responsibility for supervision and inspection of construction of a licensed project, the requirements for submission of reports will be specified.

    (2)  Reports on the operation and maintenance of each major and minor licensed project for which supervision of operations has been assigned to a Division Engineer will be submitted annually after the initial installation covered by the license has been completed. Such reports will be made on Federal Power Commission Form 10, “Operation Report” and, pursuant to paragraph 39u of AR 335-15, do not require a reports control symbol. A special report will be made in case of severe flood or interruption in operation due to failure of material or accident. Reports on operation and maintenance of transmission line projects are not required unless requested by the Commission.

    (3)  When the Federal Power Commission notifies the Chief of Engineers that it will assume the supervision of operation of a licensed project, the Division Engineer will not be required to make detailed inspections and reports. However, the Division Engineer will continue to be responsible for the project insofar as it affects the interest of navigation. The inspection of projects in this class is left to the discretion of the Division Engineer but annual reports will be submitted in triplicate, through the Chief of Engineers, on Federal Power Commission Form 10, “Operation Report”, omitting the items under “Supervision expense for period”, but including the following information only under “Memorandum Report”.

    (i) Whether the operation of the project has been satisfactory insofar as the interests of navigation are concerned.

    (ii) Whether any infraction by the licensee of the conditions in the interest of navigation has come to the attention of the Division Engineer.

    (f)  The authority vested in the Secretary of the Army by section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act is hereby delegated to the Chief of the Engineers for promulgation with regard to approval of plans of structures filed with the Federal Power Commission in connection with licensing of non-Federal hydroelectric projects.

Under section 9 of the act (27 Stat. 508; 33 U.S.C. 669), the individual proprietor or proprietors, or in case of a corporation, its manager or agent appointed for that purpose, owning mining ground in this territory which it is desired to work by the hydraulic process, must file with the Commission a verified petition, setting forth such facts as will comply with law and the rules prescribed by the Commission. The law contains detailed instructions with regard to facts required to be shown by the petitioner and the procedure to be followed by the Commission in issuing an order directing the methods and specifying the manner in which operations shall proceed. Full information on law and procedure can be obtained from the Secretary, California Debris Commission, 650 Capitol Mall, Sacramento, California 95814.

    § 209.170   Violations of laws protecting navigable waters.

#### § § 209.170

    (a) [Reserved]

    (b)  Section 14 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152; 33 U.S.C. 408), makes it unlawful for any person or persons to take possession of or make use of for any purpose, or build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, injure, obstruct by fastening vessels thereto or otherwise, or in any manner whatever impair the usefulness of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, dike, levee, wharf, pier, or other work built by the United States, or any piece of plant, floating or otherwise, used in the construction of such work under the control of the United States, in whole or in part, for the preservation and improvement of any of its navigable waters or to prevent floods, or as boundary marks, tide gauges, surveying stations, buoys, or other established marks, nor remove for ballast or other purposes any stone or other material composing such works. (The Secretary of the Army may, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, grant permission for the temporary occupation or use of any of the aforementioned public works when in his judgment such occupation or use will not be injurious to the public interest).

    (c)  (1) Section 13 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152; 33 U.S.C. 407), makes it unlawful to throw, discharge, or deposit, or cause, suffer, or procure to be thrown, discharged, or deposited either from or out of any ship, barge, or other floating craft, or from the shore, wharf, manufacturing establishment, or mill, any refuse matter of any kind or description whatever other than that flowing from streets and sewers and passing therefrom in a liquid state, into any navigable water of the United States, or into any tributary of any navigable water from which the same shall float or be washed into such navigable water, or to deposit or cause, suffer, or procure to be deposited material of any kind in any place on the bank of any navigable water or on the bank of any tributary of any navigable water, where the same shall be liable to be washed into such navigable water, either by ordinary or high tides, or by storms or floods, or otherwise, whereby navigation shall or may be impeded or obstructed. Section 13 does not apply to the operations in connection with the improvement of navigable waters or construction of public works considered necessary and proper by the United States officers supervising such improvement or public work.

    (2) An Act of Congress approved June 29, 1888 (25 Stat. 209; 33 U.S.C. 441-451), as amended on August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 970-971; 33 U.S.C. 441-451b) forbids the placing, discharging, or depositing of refuse, dirt, ashes, cinders, mud, sand, dredgings, sludge, acid, or any other matter of any kind, other than that flowing from streets, sewers, and passing therefrom in a liquid state, in the tidal waters of the harbors of New York, Hampton Roads, and Baltimore or its adjacent or tributary waters, within the limits which shall be prescribed by the Supervisor of the Harbor. The provisions of this act are enforced by the Supervisor under the direction of the Secretary of the Army.

    (d)  (1) Section 12 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 U.S.C. 406), as amended, provides that every person and every corporation that shall violate any of the provisions of sections 9 and 10 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court. The removal of any structures or parts of structures erected in violation of the provisions of the said sections may be enforced by the injunction of any district court exercising jurisdiction in any district in which such structures may exist, and proper proceedings to this end may be instituted under the direction of the Attorney General.

    (2) Section 16 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1153; 33 U.S.C. 412), provides that every person and every corporation that shall violate, or that shall knowingly aid, abet, authorize or instigate a violation of the provisions of sections 13, 14 and 15, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. On conviction thereof violators shall be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court. Any master, pilot, and engineer, or person or persons acting in such capacity, respectively, on board of any boat or vessel who shall knowingly engage in towing any scow, boat, or vessel loaded with any material specified in section 13 to any point or place of deposit or discharge in any harbor or navigable water, elsewhere than within the limits defined and permitted by the Secretary of the Army, or who shall willfully injure or destroy any work of the United States contemplated in section 14, or who shall willfully obstruct the channel of any waterway in the manner contemplated in section 15, shall be deemed guilty of a violation of the Act. Upon conviction he shall be punished as provided in this section, and shall also have his license revoked or suspended for a term to be fixed by the judge before whom tried and convicted. Any boat, vessel, scow, raft, or other craft used or employed in violating any of the provisions of sections 13, 14, and 15 shall be liable for the pecuniary penalties specified in this section, and in addition for the amount of the damages done by said boat, vessel, scow, raft, or other craft. The latter sum shall be placed to the credit of the appropriation for the improvement of the harbor or waterway in which the damage occurred, and said boat, vessel, scow, raft, or other craft may be proceeded against summarily by way of libel in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof.

    (e)  (1) Section 17 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1153; 33 U.S.C. 413) provides that the Department of Justice shall conduct the legal proceedings necessary to enforce the provisions of sections 9 to 16, inclusive, of the Act. It shall be the duty of district attorneys of the United States to prosecute vigorously all offenders against the same whenever requested to do so by the Secretary of the Army or by any of his designated representatives.

    (2) Under the provisions of section 17, District Engineers and the United States collectors of customs and other revenue officers, have power and authority to swear out process and to arrest and take into custody, with or without process, any person or persons who may commit any of the acts or offenses prohibited by sections 9 to 16, inclusive, or who may violate any of the provisions of the same. No person shall be arrested without process for any offense not committed in the presence of some one of the aforesaid officials. Whenever any arrest is made under the provisions of the Act, the person so arrested shall be brought forthwith before a commissioner, judge, or court of the United States for examination of the offenses alleged against him. Such commissioner, judge, or court shall proceed as authorized by law in case of crimes against the United States.

    (3) It is the duty of each District Engineer to take notice of any violations of the laws for the protection of the navigable waters and the works of improvement therein that may occur in his district and to take the necessary steps to secure enforcement of the law. Whenever any violation of any of these provisions of law comes to his attention he will investigate carefully the circumstances of the case and will determine the amount of the damage for which the parties committing the violation are responsible under section 16 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899. He will advise the responsible parties to remove the illegal structure or deposit or to repair the damage at their own expense within a time specified by him. When there is reasonable doubt as to legal liability or the facts do not appear to warrant legal action, the District Engineer will report the case to the Chief of Engineers for decision before communicating with the responsible parties. When the damage must be repaired within a reasonable time, if the responsible parties so request in writing and if, when considered advisable by the District Engineer to protect the interests of the United States, they furnish a satisfactory bond or other guaranty, he may cause the repairs to be made by employees of the United States and then call upon the responsible parties to pay over to him the cost of the damages when finally ascertained. Where the damage is not to be repaired within a reasonable time, the District Engineer will make final settlement with the responsible parties as promptly as possible by collecting the estimated amount of the damages. All sums so received will be deposited promptly to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States for recredit to the appropriation affected and will be accounted for in the District Engineer's money accounts by proper vouchers. With reference to the method of ascertaining the amount of the damages under section 16 of the Act, a distinction should be made between cases involving property that should be repaired and those involving property that should be abandoned. In the former cases the amount of the damages should be the total cost of repairs, less any salvage value and any enhanced value. In the latter cases, the amount of the damages should be the fair value of the property, less any salvage value. Whether or not there has been any enhanced value (, whether the fair value of the structure immediately after the repairs is greater than its fair value immediately before the damage occurred) is a matter to be determined from an actual survey of the structure and knowledge of its age and condition. Where maintenance has equalled depreciation there probably would be no enhanced value.

    (4) If the parties deny their responsibility, or if they refuse or neglect to remove any unlawful structure or deposit or to repair the damages within the time specified by the District Engineer, the matter will be reported to the Chief of Engineers with such evidence as the District Engineer may be able to obtain and his recommended action under section 17 of the Act of March 3, 1899. In a situation requiring immediate action, the District Engineer may report the case directly to the U.S. attorney for the district. The Chief of Engineers will be advised of such action by a written report. Although the Corps of Engineers has certain police powers under this Act it has been the long standing policy to secure compliance with its provisions short of legal proceedings. Accordingly every effort will be made to accomplish corrective measures prior to initiation of action leading to such proceedings. As a general rule, while minor and unintentional or accidental violations of the provisions of the Act need not be reported to the Chief of Engineers, all willful or intentional violations and all cases in which the parties responsible refuse or neglect to remove the unlawful structure or deposit or to make good the damages suffered should be reported promptly to the Chief of Engineers in accordance with the above. It is the policy not to recommend prosecution when the violation of law is trivial, apparently unpremeditated, and results in no material public injury. Each report recommending prosecution should be accompanied by a full statement of the case and copies of correspondence relating thereto.

    (5) The procedure in cases involving injurious deposits is similar to that described for other violations of law except that as the damage caused thereby cannot be repaired readily there will be no reason for serving any notice on the parties responsible for the violations further than to bring to their attention the consequences thereof.

    (6) Section 6 of the river and Harbor Act approved March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 1148; 33 U.S.C. 417) provides that expenses incurred by the Corps of Engineers in all investigations, inspections, hearings, reports, service of notice, or other action incidental to examinations into alleged violations of laws for protection and preservation of navigable waters shall be payable from any funds which may be available for the improvement, maintenance, operation, or care of the waterways or harbors affected. If such funds are not available in sums judged by the Chief of Engineers to be adequate, they shall be payable from any funds available for examinations, surveys, and contingencies of rivers and harbors.

    § 209.180   Temporary closure of waterway to navigation.

#### § § 209.180

    (a) When an application is received for the temporary closure of a waterway for the construction of a structure or the performance of other work in the waterway, the District Engineer will assure himself of the necessity for the closure and arrange after informal communication with any important navigation interests concerned the time and duration of the closure which will enable the operations to be completed with the least interference with navigation. If there is no question as to the necessity and propriety of the closure, the District Engineer is authorized to inform the applicant as follows: “The Department of the Army will interpose no objection to the closure for a stated period beginning at a specified date:  That prior thereto the applicant will notify navigation interests by an advertisement in the press or otherwise as the District Engineer may approve and on the understanding that the waiver of objection does not affect the liability of the applicant for any damages that may arise by reason of the closure.” The letter to the applicant will be signed “By Authority of the Secretary of the Army” and distribution made as prescribed for permits.

    (b) District Engineers will give careful consideration to the effect of any closure on through navigation. Should coordination with other districts be necessary the case will be forwarded to the Division Engineer for such coordination.

    (c) Cases not falling within the authority above conferred will be forwarded to the Chief of Engineers with the recommendations of the Division and District Engineers.

#### § § 209.190

    § 209.200   Regulations governing navigable waters.

#### § § 209.200

    (a)  (1) Regulations prescribed by or under the direction of the Secretary of the Army to govern navigation and navigable waters, are contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, title 33, Navigation and Navigable Waters, Chapter II.

    (2) District engineers (or division engineers if considered preferable by the latter to avoid duplication in cases where the regulations involved apply to more than one district) will distribute copies of departmental regulations to all known interested parties as soon as their publication has been noted in the  In the case of regulations applicable to more than one division, distribution will be handled as agreed upon by the division engineers concerned. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-553), publication in the  shall be not less than 30 days prior to the effective date except as otherwise provided upon good cause found and published with the regulations.

    (b)  (1) Section 7 of the River and Harbor Act approved August 8, 1917 (40 Stat. 266; 33 U.S.C. 1) authorizes the Secretary of the Army to prescribe such regulations for the use, administration, and navigation of the navigable waters of the United States as public necessity may require for the protection of life and property, or for operations of the United States in channel improvement, covering all matters not specifically delegated by law to some other executive department. The statute provides for the posting of regulations and punishment for violations.

    (2) Section 6 of the River and Harbor Act approved June 13, 1902 (32 Stat. 374; 33 U.S.C. 499) provides that regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army may be enforced as provided in section 17 of the River and Harbor Act approved March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1153; 33 U.S.C. 413).

    (3) District Engineers will take action with respect to regulations prescribed for waterways under their jurisdiction:

    (i) To insure that the regulations are brought to the attention of the public.

    (ii) To insure that the regulations are properly and fairly administered.

    (iii) To recommend any revisions necessary to permit full use of the waterway by the public.

    (c)  (1) The Secretary of the Army has authority to prescribe regulations for the use and navigation of any area of the navigable waters of the United States or waters under the jurisdiction of the United States likely to be endangered by Department of Defense operations. This authority is pursuant to the provisions of Chapter XIX of the Army Act of July 9, 1918, or of section 7 of the River and Harbor Act of August 8, 1917.

    (2) On receipt of a request from any element of the Department of Defense or other agency for approval by the Secretary of the Army of regulations establishing danger zones under authority of either Act, the District Engineer will, prior to issuing any public notice, make certain that the applicant: (i) Has coordinated its proposed operations with any operations being conducted or contemplated by other agencies in the same area with a view to avoiding interagency conflicts, (ii) has obtained clearance from the proper Regional Subcommittee on Airspace, Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Control (Air Coordinating Committee), where the use of airspace is involved, and (iii) has conducted preliminary discussions with local interests when considered advisable. In the case of proposed danger zones off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, the coordination referred to in (c)(2)(i) of this section will include the Commander, Service Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, or the Commander, Western Sea Frontier.

    (3) The authority to prescribe danger zone regulations must be exercised so as not to interfere with or restrict unreasonably the food fishing industry. Whenever the establishment of a proposed danger zone or restricted area may affect fishing operations the District Engineer will consult with the regional director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior. Two copies of all notices of applications for the establishment of danger zones and restricted areas will be forwarded to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force. In addition, notices of all applications relating to the establishment of aerial gunnery and bombing areas will be sent to local Army, Navy, and Federal Aviation Agency representatives.

    (4) If the use of water areas is desired only for such temporary, occasional, or intermittent periods that operations can be conducted safely without imposing restrictions on navigation, applicants may be informed that formal regulations by the Secretary of the Army are not required. However, proper notices for mariners requesting that vessels avoid the areas will be issued by the District Engineer to all interested persons. Copies will be sent to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, D.C. 20226 and the Commander, U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, Washington, D.C. 20390.

    (d)  (1) Section 4 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 1147; 33 U.S.C. 419), authorizes the Secretary of the Army to prescribe regulations to govern the transportation and dumping into any navigable water, or waters adjacent thereto, of dredgings and other refuse materials whenever in his judgment such regulations are required in the interest of navigation.

    (2) Section 13 of the river and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1152; 33 U.S.C. 407) authorizes the Secretary of the Army to permit the deposit of refuse matter in navigable waters, whenever in the judgment of the Chief of Engineers anchorage and navigation will not be injured thereby, within limits to be defined and under conditions to be prescribed by him. Although the Department has exercised this authority from time to time, it is considered preferable to act under Section 4 of the River and Harbor Act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 1147; 33 U.S.C. 419). As a means of assisting the Chief of Engineers in determining the effect on anchorage of vessels, the views of the U.S. Coast Guard will be solicited by coordination with the Commander of the local Coast Guard District.

    (3) Under the authority contained in an Act of Congress to prevent obstructive and injurious deposits within the harbor and adjacent waters of New York City of June 29, 1888 (25 Stat. 209; 33 U.S.C. 441), the Supervisor of New York Harbor has established dumping areas in those waters and has prescribed regulations for their use. The provisions of the act are enforced by the Supervisor under the direction of the Secretary of the Army.

    (4) In considering requests for the establishment of dumping grounds, District and Division Engineers will give careful consideration to the requirements of navigation and will take action to prevent unreasonable injury to fish and wildlife.

    (e)  (1) When applications are received for the promulgation of regulations as outlined in paragraphs (b) through (f), inclusive, of this section, District Engineers will issue public notices to all parties deemed likely to be interested and specifically to the agencies referred to in these paragraphs. The notice should fix a limiting date within which comments will be received, normally a period not less than 30 days after the actual mailing of the notice. If time is an essential element when adequately explained by the applicant, the District Engineer is authorized to give interested parties a minimum of 10 days after receipt of the notice in which to present protests. A copy of every notice issued will be sent to the Chief of Engineers, Attention: ENGCW-ON.

    (2) Copies of the notices sent to interested parties, together with a list of parties to whom sent, will accompany reports on all applications for promulgation of regulations submitted to the Chief of Engineers for necessary action.

    (3) In all instances when response to a public notice has been received from a Member of Congress, the District Engineer will inform the Member of Congress of the final action taken on the application.

    (f)  (1) It is the policy of the Chief of Engineers to conduct his civil works activities in an atmosphere of public understanding, trust, and mutual cooperation and in a manner responsive to public needs and desires. To this end, public hearings are helpful and will be held whenever there appears to be sufficient public interest to justify such action. In case of doubt, a public hearing should be held.

    (2) Among the instances warranting public hearings are general public opposition to the promulgation of regulations governing the use and navigation of navigable waters. District Engineers will notify the Division Engineer of the need for a hearing, state the proposed arrangements therefor and obtain his concurrence therein. Public hearings will be held in any case when Congressional interests or responsible local authorities make an official and valid request therefor and such action will fulfill the above-stated policy and objectives.

    § 209.220   Flood control regulations.

#### § § 209.220

    (a)  On projects authorized subject to specified conditions of local cooperation, no construction is undertaken by the Department of the Army until satisfactory assurances of the required local cooperation have been accepted by the Secretary of the Army and until any lands, easements, and rights-of-way required to be furnished by local interests have been made available for at least a complete unit of the project. The District Engineers notify local interests concerned of the requirements of local cooperation and request assurances by registered mail prior to the preparation of final plans and specifications. Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army for the maintenance and operation of local flood protection works are contained in § 208.10 of this chapter. When assurances satisfactory to the District Engineer are received, they are forwarded through the Division Engineer to the Chief of Engineers for consideration of the Secretary of the Army. The District Engineers advise local interests of the action taken by the Department. Completed projects or completed useful units thereof are normally turned over to local interests for maintenance and operation as soon as the construction and testing of equipment is completed and the project is in proper condition for the assumption of maintenance and operation by local interests. The transfer is accomplished by formal notice from the District Engineer to the local interests that the completed facilities are being turned over to them for maintenance and operation as of a specific date. During construction, District Engineers keep the local interests concerned advised as to the probable date of transfer.

    (b)  Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army in accordance with section 7 of the Flood Control Act of December 22, 1944 (58 Stat. 890; 33 U.S.C. 709) are for the purpose of coordinating the operation of the flood control features of reservoirs constructed wholly or in part with Federal funds and other flood control improvements to obtain the maximum protection from floods which can reasonably be obtained with the proper operation of all flood control improvements. Proposed regulations are determined by the District Engineer in cooperation with the persons responsible for the maintenance and operation of the reservoir involved after a detailed study of the flood problems and the characteristics of the reservoir project. The proposed regulations are forwarded by the District Engineer through the Division Engineer to the Chief of Engineers for consideration of the Secretary of the Army. When approved by the Secretary of the Army, these regulations are published in part 208 of this chapter.

    § 209.230   Use of reservoir areas for recreation.

#### § § 209.230

    The Department of the Army in accordance with Section 4 of the Flood Control Act of December 22, 1944, as amended by section 4 of the Flood Control Act of July 24, 1946 (60 Stat. 641) prepares and administers plans to obtain the maximum sustained public benefit from the use of reservoir areas under its control for recreation and other related purposes, when such use is consistent with the operation and maintenance of the reservoir project for the specific purposes of the reservoir project as authorized by law and when such use is determined not to be contrary to the public interest. The plans are prepared and administered by the District Engineers, subject to review and approval of the Division Engineers and the Chief of Engineers, in close cooperation with other Federal agencies and local interests. The views and desires of these agencies and local interests are obtained normally by conferences with the District Engineers. In many cases, public hearings are held by the District Engineers at appropriate times in the vicinity of the reservoir area at which time anyone can express his views relative to these plans for consideration of the Department of the Army. Rules and regulations are prescribed by the Secretary of the Army to govern the public use of the reservoir areas in accordance with the law as a part of the master plan for recreational and related uses of the reservoir area. These rules and regulations are published in 36 CFR parts 311 to 326. Licenses and leases are granted under the law containing conditions and provisions to govern the use of specific portions of the reservoir area. Full information concerning such matters may be obtained from the District Engineer in charge of the reservoir.

    § 209.300   Flood control regulations.

#### § § 209.300

    (a) Regulations for the operation and maintenance of local flood protection works approved by the Secretary of the Army under the authority contained in Section 3 of the Flood Control Act of June 22, 1936, as amended and supplemented, are codified as § 208.10 of this chapter. These regulations cover conditions normally and regularly required. Whenever the regulations are not sufficiently broad to cover the specific maintenance and operation requirements of a particular project, District Engineers will submit through the Division Engineers recommended additional regulations needed for that particular project. Such supplemental regulations will require approval of the Secretary of the Army and will be made applicable only to the individual project concerned. Local interests will be advised of the approved regulations for operation and maintenance of local flood protection works at the time assurances of local cooperation are requested. District Engineers will keep informed as to the extent of compliance with approved regulations for operation and maintenance through regular, periodic inspection of the projects concerned and through careful analysis of the semiannual reports which the operating and maintaining agencies are required to submit in accordance with the regulations. The District Engineer's views as to any measures required to conform to the approved regulations will be furnished to the agencies responsible. In any case where the District Engineer has been unable to arrange satisfactory compliance or where there is question or disagreement as to the measures required for compliance, a report of the circumstances, together with the recommendations of the District and Division Engineers, will be submitted to the Chief of Engineers for consideration.

    (b) Regulations for the use of storage allocated for flood control or navigation at reservoirs constructed wholly or in part with Federal funds provided on the basis of such purposes, are contained in § 208.16  of this chapter.

    § 209.310   Representation of submarine cables and pipelines on nautical charts.

#### § § 209.310

    (a) The policy of the Corps of Engineers with respect to showing the locations of submarine cables and pipelines on nautical charts published by the Corps of Engineers is as follows:

    (1) Within protected waters such as harbors, rivers, bays, estuaries or other inland waterways the location of submarine cables and pipelines is to be indicated by shaded areas marked “Pipeline area” or “Cable area”. The extent of the limits of the area will be governed by local conditions but shall include the immediate area which overlies the cable or pipeline.

    (2) Ordinarily, the shaded area on a chart which depicts a cable area or pipeline area should not exceed 500 feet on each side of the location of the cable or pipeline except on small scale charts where an area of that width would not be of sufficient prominence.

    (3) The shaded area will be designated “cable area” or “pipeline area” as appropriate, but no other information as to the character or ownership of the installation will appear on the chart.

    (b) District engineers will furnish copies of all permits issued for submarine cable and pipelines to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service, ATTN: N/CG222, Rockville, MD 20852, with his/her recommendation of whether or not the installation should be shown on NOAA nautical charts. National Ocean Service must be notified of the commencement and completion dates for all permitted activities under this section. (Note: Decisions to publish these cables and pipelines on NOAA nautical charts lie solely within NOAA's discretion.)

    § 209.315   Public access to navigation works.

#### § § 209.315

    While the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the army for various navigation improvements usually strictly prohibit trespass on Government property, those regulations will not be construed as prohibiting access to navigation works of general public interest subject to the following criteria:

    (a) The public will not be permitted in areas where their presence would subject themselves or Government operating personnel to serious accident hazards.

    (b) The public will not be permitted in areas where their presence would interfere with any phases of navigation operations.

    (c) The public will be given access to all areas other than those specified under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, subject only to the normal legal requirements with respect to property and personal rights.

Project material furnished direct to Coast Guard Commanders will include:

    (i) Information as to the authorization by Congress of a project involving changes affecting aids, such as channel limits, breakwaters, including a copy of the project document;

    (ii) The proposed operations on such projects during the next fiscal year, to be furnished annually on the release of the budget estimates;

    (iii) Plans showing the final location of the channel limits or structures to be furnished at the time work is undertaken.

    (2) Changes in channel limits affecting navigation aids, made under general or specific provisions of the law, should be made the subject of a conference with the Coast Guard District Commander. He will be promptly informed as to the approval of such changes and the probable date of completion of the work.

    (3) District Engineers will furnish direct to the various Coast Guard District Commanders, for their immediate information, any facts which may come to their attention in connection with their duties which will be of benefit to the Coast Guard in maintaining its system of aids to navigation. This should include statements as to the displacement of or defects in any such aids to navigation.

    (4) If work involving harbor or channel improvements directly affects any existing aids to navigation or any structures of the Coast Guard, Districts Engineers will, when practicable, give notice to the Coast Guard District Commander sufficiently in advance to permit taking such steps as may be deemed necessary by the Coast Guard. If the Coast Guard District Commander specifically requests that the affected structure be replaced, the District Engineer will inform him of the estimated cost and will proceed with the work if so authorized by the Chief of Engineers. On completion of the work, the District Engineer will promptly furnish the Coast Guard District Commander, for settlement, an account of the expense incurred.

    (e)  (1) Whenever channel dredging or other channel improvements are being performed, necessary temporary markers, such as ranges and light poles, should be installed and maintained by the District Engineer pending the installation of permanent aids by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard desires that information regarding aids to navigation installed or maintained by District Engineers in connection with harbor or channel improvement be furnished promptly. Such information is needed for inclusion in Notice to Mariners as published by the Coast Guard, and where desirable on the charts of the waters concerned.

    (2) District Engineers will notify the Coast Guard District Commander in every case where aids to navigation for marking works of harbor or channel improvements are established or discontinued. Notice should be given of such aids as may be of use or interest to general navigation. Notice need not be given as to such buoys, lights, or fog signals as are of temporary or unimportant character, or of importance only to the Corps of Engineers. Omit also lights or fog signals on ferry slips and on piers used only by certain vessels, and stakes, bushes, and barrel buoys marking shallow and little-used channels.

    (3) In placing aids to navigation in connection with harbor or channel improvement works, District Engineers should see that they do not conflict in character or otherwise with other aids to navigation in the vicinity. District Engineers should confer with the Coast Guard District Commander on this subject.

    (4) The necessary blank forms for reporting information regarding Corps of Engineers aids will be furnished upon request by the Coast Guard District Commander.

    (5) It is essential that the Coast Guard by furnished with information for publication concerning markers installed by the Corps of Engineers as temporary aids to navigation, for new improvements, in advance of permanent aids, and also concerning other markers that may be established in connection with Corps of Engineers operations that may also serve as important aids to navigation. Care will be exercised to see that all markers established are not misleading to general navigation and do not interfere with aids to navigation established by the Coast Guard.

    (f)  (1) In order to distinguish buoys placed and maintained by the Corps of Engineers for dredging purposes from aids to navigation placed by the Coast Guard, Corps buoys will be painted white with the top 2 feet painted light green.

    (2) If buoys with special markings are needed to indicate the different sides of the navigable channel, prior arrangements will be made with the Coast Guard District Commander having jurisdiction.

    (g)  (1) District Engineers responsible for harbors and waterways shown on charts of the National Ocean Survey (NOAA), will report the channel conditions promptly, using standard tabular forms, to:

    (2) Channel survey drawings furnished to the Coast Guard are to include:

    (i) Either NAD 27 or State Plane grids.

    (ii) Plots of the positions of aids to navigation.

    (iii) Written notations of the coordinates in NAD 27 or State Plane Coordinates of the fixed aids to navigation found during the survey.

    (3) The standard tabular forms with illustrated data follow:

    (i) For channels 400 feet wide and greater (ENG Form 4020-R).

    (ii) For channels 100 to 400 feet wide (ENG Form 4021-R).

    (iii) For channels less than 100 feet in width, report controlling depths only based on at least 80 percent of project width, 40 percent on either side of centerline. (The submission of tabular forms is not required for channels having a project depth less than 10 feet except coastal inlets and harbors of refuge.)

    (4) The tabulations of depths should be amplified by footnotes or otherwise to show clearly and definitely the location of controlling shoals, tendency of shoals to recur, and all other critical information of special value and importance for safe navigation of the channel. Reaches of channel not presently named should be identified in the tabular form by reference to chartered aids or features, or assigned identifying names, numbers or letters. For localized irregular project areas where the application of the tabular form would not be practical, the controlling depth based on a safe navigable width will be described as well as unusual or critical conditions of shoaling.

    (5) The prompt dissemination of the latest detailed information concerning channel conditions is of utmost importance, and necessary measures will be taken to insure that such information is reported without delay simultaneously to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, the Coast Guard, the National Ocean Survey and Defense Mapping Agency. When a dangerous shoaling is found during the progress of a survey, information thereon will be furnished immediately to the above-mentioned agencies, so that such information may be made available to mariners promptly, and buoys shifted to mark the shoal. Descriptions of any dredging or other operations in important channels in tidal waters—either in progress and not already reported, or soon to be undertaken—together with a statement of the work and expected duration, will also be reported in order that Naval and other vessels may be warned to look out for dredges and other plant, temporary markers and lights.

    (6) District Engineers having charge of improvements of harbors and waterways shown on charts of the Defense Mapping Agency or of the National Ocean Survey will send to both offices promptly, as ascertained for the correction of such charts, the following information: Descriptions of changes in channel location and depth, or of obstructions that may be discovered, with such prints and other information as may be necessary to permit the existing charts to be corrected to date. All maps should contain sufficient data to permit the fixed plane or reference, bench marks, base lines, etc., to be determined and located. The survey stations should be shown and, when no unreasonable expenditure of time or labor is involved, the map will show one or more triangulation station(s) of the National Ocean Survey in such a way as to facilitate connection of old or new work. The source of authority for the shoreline and topography should be stated on the map. The data supplied should indicate what charts are affected.

    (7) When any survey of areas covered by charts of the Defense Mapping Agency or the National Ocean Survey is completed, a print of each tracing will be sent direct to both the Defense Mapping Agency and the National Ocean Survey. It is not necessary that tracings be fully complete as to form and title when such prints are made. An informal manuscript title marked “Advance Sheets”, and containing a description sufficient to identify the locality and to identify the source of the map, will be sufficient.

    (8) Information relative to the improvement of harbors and waterways such as dredging operations, and precautions rendered necessary due to the presence of dredging or other plant will, when considered necessary, be brought to the attention of vessel owners or operators regularly using the waterway. This will be done through issuing bulletins or notices by District Engineers.

    (h)  Changes affecting navigation will be made promptly whenever information of immediate concern to navigation becomes known. Items of information especially desired are channel conditions as revealed by surveys, changes in channel conditions, either by natural causes or by dredging or other work, changes in approved projects for improvement with statements of results expected from proposed operations, descriptions of proposed dredging or other Federal work of improvement such as breakwater, pier, and revetment construction or alterations, descriptions of proposed or completed municipal or private improvements in or affecting navigable waters. Additional items of information desired are descriptions of wrecks, uncharted shoals, and other obstructions to navigation and particulars as to proposed or completed removal of same, changes in buoys or lights, erection of new, or changes in existing bridges, new or revised Federal or local rules and regulations for harbors and channels, and establishment or existence of danger areas in navigable waters. Reproductions of drawings or sketches which will be helpful in interpreting the data shall accompany the reports. The reports will not be limited to a reference to an accompanying drawing or sketch, but will contain a complete description in form suitable for publication in notices to mariners and the monthly supplements to the U.S. Coast Pilot. In this respect, the reports will provide enough information that a single notification to navigational interests will suffice. In the case of dredging or construction work, the bare statement that work will commence or has commenced on a certain date is insufficient. All additional information possible, such as probable duration of operations and object of work, will be given—the latter in the case of dredging being such data as the area to be covered and the depth expected to be provided. The reports required by this paragraph will be identified by reference to the appropriate Engineer Manual or regulation and will be numbered consecutively by each District during the calendar year, starting with number 1 at the beginning of each year.

    (i)  (1) Pub. L. 85-480, approved 2 July 1958, authorizes the Chief of Engineers to publish information pamphlets, maps, brochures, and other material on river and harbor, flood control, and other Civil Works activities, including related public park and recreation facilities under his jurisdiction, as he may deem to be of value to the general public.

    (2) This Public Law authorizes the Chief of Engineers to provide for the sale of any of the material prepared under authority of the act—and of publications, charts, or other material prepared under his direction pursuant to other legislative authorization or appropriation, and to charge therefor a sum of not less than the cost of reproduction.

    (3) District Engineers are authorized to publish the material covered in paragraph 8a above, and to sell such material. Except for material specifically prepared for free distribution to the general public, the charges for such other published information will be not less than the cost of its reproduction.

    (4) Condition survey maps or charts, sold or otherwise distributed to the public, showing depths will specifically state the date or dates that the surveys were made. They shall also have the following notation printed or stamped thereon:

    “The information depicted on this map represents the results of surveys made on the dates indicated and can only be considered as indicating the general conditions existing at that time.”

    § 209.345   Water resource policies and authorities.

#### § § 209.345

    (a)  This regulation gives general instructions on use of section 215 of the Flood Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-483) to reimburse a non-Federal public body for construction of part of an authorized Federal project, part of an authorized Federal project. It establishes general policies, outlines procedures to be followed in reaching an agreement with an eligible non-Federal entity, and provides guidance on the provisions of such an agreement. All authorized projects are subject to this Act and regulation.

    (b)  This regulation applies to all field operating agencies having Civil Works responsibilities.

    (c)  (1) Section 215, FCA of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-483, 42 U.S.C. 1962d-5a.). (APP A, this regulation).

    (2) Senate Document No. 10, 90th Congress, 1st Session, “Study of Federal Reimbursement Policy for Work by States and other Non-Federal Entities on Authorized Water Resources Projects.”

    (3) Section 221, FCA of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-611, 42 U.S.C. 1962d-5b).

    (4) ER 405-2-680.

    (5) ER 1140-2-301.

    (6) ER 1180-1-1, (para. A-310, App. A).

    (d)  (1) The specific limitations put upon the allotment of funds authorized by section 215 indicate that only limited use should be made of the authority. It will, therefore, be Corps of Engineers policy to restrict the use of this authority to cases that meet all of the following conditions:

    (i) The work, even if the Federal Government does not complete the authorized project, will be separately useful or will be an integral part of a larger non-Federal undertaking that is separately useful;

    (ii) The work done by the non-Federal entity will not create a potential hazard;

    (iii) Approval of the proposal will be in the general public interest;

    (iv) Only work commenced after project authorization and execution of an agreement pursuant to this Regulation will be eligible for reimbursement or credit;

    (v) Proposed reimbursement will not exceed the amount that the District Engineer considers a reasonable estimate of the reduction in Federal expenditures resulting from construction of the project component by the non-Federal entity.

    (2) Before finally approving any agreement under section 215, the Chief of Engineers will inform the Secretary of the Army and the Chairman (Senate and House), Subcommittee on Public Works, Committee on Appropriations of the proposed arrangements. The Chief of Engineers will not sign an agreement until Secretarial and Committee concurrences are obtained.

    (3) Section 215 authority will not be used where it might appear to circumvent the intent of Congress. It will not, for example, be used to initiate work on projects to which Congressional committees have indicated general opposition or refused to provide requested funds, or to accelerate portions of work on which construction has already been commenced by the Federal Government.

    (4) Section 215(f) authorizes a specific allotment of funds to reimburse non-Federal entities for work accomplished under the Section. No allotment has been established, nor is one proposed at this time. Until one is, and firm procedures are established, any agreement with a non-Federal entity shall call for reimbursement, or for credit against required contributions, only when construction funds for the Federal project which incorporates the part constructed by the non-Federal entity are appropriated and allocated.

    (5) The non-Federal entity will normally be required to develop the design memorandum, engineering plans, and specifications for the work it proposes to undertake. Subject to policies established in ER 1140-2-301, as modified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the District Engineer may provide engineering services with funds advanced by the non-Federal entity if he determines it to be impracticable for the entity to obtain the services elsewhere. Non-Federal engineering and overhead costs for the part of the Federal project that the non-Federal entity proposes to construct will be part of the reimbursement agreement.

    (6) The agreement shall include local cooperation items required by the project authorization and by Section 221, FCA of 1970.

    (7) Reimbursement of non-Federal work under Section 215 is not applicable to small projects authorized under the general authority of Section 107, Pub. L. 86-645, as amended. (33 U.S.C. 577); Section 205, Pub. L. 858, 80th Congress, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 701s); and Section 103, Pub. L. 87-874, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 426g); and Section 14, Pub. L. 79-526 (33 U.S.C. 701r).

    (e)  (1) Non-Federal entities desiring reimbursement under Section 215 for constructing part of an authorized Federal project should confer with the District Engineer and submit a written proposal to him. This proposal will form the basis for consulting, as needed, with OCE and for deciding whether the proposal meets the policy criteria of paragraph (d) of this section, and whether to continue under the procedures below and what sequence to follow.

    (2) If Federal preconstruction planning funds are not available to the project and it is considered impractical for the non-Federal entity to prepare a partial design memorandum and/or plans and specifications, the draft agreement may propose that this work be accomplished by the Corps of Engineers through an advance of non-Federal funds for this purpose. Certain advances of funds will be necessary, in any event, to cover other costs which are required on the part of the Corps of Engineers. Paragraph 11 of ER 1140-2-301 requires that requests to the Appropriations Committees for approval of advances of funds should normally be submitted to the Committees by non-Federal interests outside of Corps of Engineers channels. An exception to this procedure will be made in the case of Section 215 proposals in that the request for approval of advances will be made a part of the request to the committees for approval of the overall arrangement referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Thus, proposed advances of funds for the following purposes will be clearly set forth in the draft agreement: (i) Preparation of a partial design memorandum and/or plans and specifications (ii) corps review of design scheduled for accomplishment by local interests, and (iii) periodic and final inspections.

    (3) The District Engineer will submit for review an unsigned draft agreement to OCE. All agreements will be prepared for the signature of the Chief of Engineers.

    (4) The District Engineer will be notified of any changes in the draft agreement that the Chief of Engineers may require, and will negotiate a final agreement with the non-Federal entity. After signature of the agreement by the non-Federal entity, the District Engineer will forward three copies to HQDA (DAEN-CWO-C) WASH DC 20314, for signature by the Chief of Engineers.

    (5) Upon receipt from OCE of the full executed agreement, the District Engineer will transmit the signed agreement to the non-Federal entity.

    (6) The Division Engineer will review the (partial) design memorandum, and, if it meets the relevant criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, will submit it to OCE with the recommendations on whether or not the work may proceed subject to reimbursement under the agreement.

    (7) The Division Engineer will approve plans and specifications.

    (8) The non-Federal entity will award contract.

    (9) The District Engineer will conduct periodic and final inspections.

    (10) Upon completion of the local work, the District Engineer will certify the cost data, and that performance has been in accordance with the agreement.

    (f)  Agreements under Section 215 should follow the general format presented in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, adapted as warranted by the specific case. Each agreement shall:

    (1) Expire 3 years after the date of execution if the non-Federal entity has not commenced the work contemplated by the agreement.

    (2) State the time allowed for completion of the work. A reasonable time shall be allowed, but normally not over 2 construction seasons.

    (3) Fully describe the work to be accomplished by the non-Federal entity and specify the manner in which it will be carried out.

    (4) The agreement will specify that reimbursement by the Federal Government will not exceed $1,000,000.

    (5) Provide for necessary review of designs, plans, and specifications, by the District Engineer.

    (6) Provide for examination and review of proposed contracts and for inspection of the work by the District Engineer for conformance with the terms of the agreement.

    (7) State fully the basis on which reimbursement or credit shall be determined, and provide for the final adjustment when the balance of the Federal project is constructed. If the improvement proposed by the non-Federal entity includes work that will not become a part of the Federal project, the means of determining the part eligible for reimbursement shall be fully defined.

    (8) State that such reimbursement shall depend upon appropriation of funds applicable to the project and shall not take precedence over other pending projects of higher priority.

    (9) Specify that reimbursement or credit for non-Federal work shall apply only to that work undertaken after execution of the agreement. The term “work” shall include advance engineering and design as well as actual construction.

    (10) State that the agreement is not to be construed as committing the United States to reimbursement if the Federal project is not undertaken, or if the Federal project should be modified in such a way that the work performed by the non-Federal entity does not constitute a part thereof.

    (11) Contain applicable equal employment clauses from Armed Services Procurement Regulations.

    (g)  (1) The non-Federal entity may be reimbursed by a payment of cash, or, preferably, by reductions in any non-Federal contribution to the Federal project that may have been required by the legislation authorizing it, or by a combination of cash and such reductions.

    (2) The amount of reimbursement shall equal the approved expenditures made by the non-Federal entity for work that would have been accomplished at Federal expense if the entire project were carried out by the Corps of Engineers, and as covered in the agreement under paragraphs (f) (7) and (10) of this section. The amount of reimbursement will not exceed, however, the amount that the District Engineer finds to be a reasonable estimate of the reduction in Federal expenditure resulting from construction by the non-Federal entity.

    § 221.1   Investigation and supervision of hydropower projects under the Federal Power Act (ER 1140-2-4).

#### § § 221.1

    (a)  This regulation   establishes procedures for executing Corps of Engineers functions under the authority of the Federal Power Act (FPA) administered by the Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), formerly Federal Power Commission. Based on a specific request from FERC, these functions include:

    (1) Investigation of applications filed with FERC for permits and licenses, and for relicensing of projects to ascertain impacts on Corps of Engineers responsibilities.

    (2) Investigation of applications for surrender or termination of license to ascertain impacts on Corps of Engineers responsibilities.

    (3) Supervision and inspection of operations of licensed hydroelectric projects to ascertain impacts on Corps of Engineers responsibilities.

    (b)  This regulation applies to all field operating agencies having Civil Works responsibilities.

    (c)  (1) Federal Power Commission publication entitled “Federal Power Act”, as amended, dated 1 April 1975. The Act was originally enacted 10 June 1920 (41 Stat. 1063, 16 U.S.C. 791-823). This publication can be obtained from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

    (2) Code of Federal Regulations, Title 18, part 1 to 149 relating to FERC General Rules and Regulations, available at the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

    (3) ER 1145-2-303 (33 CFR 209.120),   Permits for Activities in Navigable Waters or Ocean Waters.

    (4) ER 1140-2-1, Submission of Data for Headwater Benefits Determination.

    (d) —(1)  A non-Federal hydroelectric project for which the FERC has issued a license granting authority for either construction, in the case of a proposed project, or for continued operation and maintenance of an existing project.

    (2)  Hydroelectric projects with more than 2,000 horsepower installed capacity.

    (3)  Hydroelectric projects having installed capacity of 2,000 horsepower or less.

    (4)  An application filed by a non-Federal entity with the FERC as a preliminary step in anticipation of filing for a license to construct and operate a hydroelectric project. A preliminary permit does not authorize construction. It merely gives the permittee priority of application for a FERC license over other non-Federal entities for a period of time. The permittee then develops information necessary for inclusion in an application for license to construct and operate a hydroelectric project. Analysis of this information may result in a decision to apply for the license or to withdraw the intent.

    (5)  A procedure applicable to projects for which the original period of license (usually 50 years) will expire or has expired and application for new license has been or will be filed with the FERC.

    (6)  An act whereby the Federal government assumes project ownership. Upon expiration of a license for a hydroelectric project, the United States, under certain specific conditions set forth in section 14 of the Federal Power Act may “take over”, maintain and operate the project. This does not apply to any project owned by a State or local government. Take over procedures are not applicable to “Minor Projects.”

    (e)  The Federal Power Act as amended delegates to the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Engineers and the Corps of Engineers certain functions necessary for the FERC's administration of the Act. Implementation was provided through instructions issued by the President in a letter dated 18 May 1931 to the Secretary of War. These functions are set forth in the following excerpts from the Act:

    (1) Section 2 of the Act provides in part that:

    (2) Section 4(e) of the Act provides in part that:

    (f)  Upon referral by the FERC, the Chief of Engineers will assign the investigation of an application for permit, license or relicensing to the appropriate Division Engineer who will submit a report on the investigation as specified herein to HQDA (DAEN-CWE-HY) WASH DC 20314 (exempt from reports control, Paragraph 7-2y, AR 335-15). The investigation should be coordinated with all interested organization elements including Engineering, Construction/Operations, Planning and Office of the Counsel. The date that the report is to be submitted will be specified. The nature of investigation and report by the Division Engineer will depend upon the nature of the request from the FERC. In general, reports as appropriate for the type of application filed with the Commission will consider the following items as pertinent and will include recommendation of pertinent license provisions:

    (1)  (i) The effect of the project on navigation and flood control, including adequacies of the plans of the structures affecting navigation. Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act provides for approval of plans for hydroelectric power projects as noted in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Section 4(e) approval normally will obviate the need for a Department of Army permit under section 10 of the 1899 River and Harbor Act. The basis for Corps approval under section 4(e) will be limited to effects on navigation; however, section 4(e) does not obviate the need for a Department of the Army permit pursuant to section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (see paragraph (i)(2)) of this section. Such a permit is subject to a full public interest review pursuant to 33 CFR part 320 and the application of the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines in 40 CFR part 230.

    (ii) Recommendations for license provisions required to protect the interest of navigation. This item is discussed under paragraphs 7, 8 and 9.

    (iii) Consideration of the project in relation to a comprehensive plan for developing the basin water resources from the standpoint of the Corps of Engineers' programs and responsibilities. Specific references should be made to pertinent published Congressional documents containing results of studies and/or to Congressional resolutions directing studies to be made to provide identification.

    (iv) Consideration of environmental aspects of a project as related to navigation and flood control matters or other specific Corps interests and responsibilities in particular cases.

    (v) The matter of possible redevelopment of an existing project to improve the usefulness of the project in relation to the objectives of the Corps program in the basin. In the case of an unconstructed project, based on request from the Commission, a recommendation along with justification, should be included as to whether or not development should be undertaken by the United States.

    (vi) Consideration of structural safety and adequacy of spillway design flood for FERC licensed projects are the responsibility of the FERC. The Dam Safety Act, Pub. L. 92-367 provides that dams constructed pursuant to license issued under the authority of Federal Power Act are specifically exempted from the Corps National inspection program. This does not preclude the Corps District and Division offices from making comments on license applications for the FERC information, about any design deficiencies that are brought to their attention.

    (2)  (i) Consider paragraphs (f) (1) through (6) of this section.

    (ii) Recommendations should be furnished to the FERC with respect to possible need for “take over” of a project by the Federal Government. Details on “take over” under the Federal Power Act are provided in part 16 of the CFR, title 18 (part 1 to 149). A copy of part 16 is provided for ready reference in appendix A of this part.

    (iii) FERC Preliminary Permit Application. Consider appropriate recommendations to insure coordination of applicant's studies with the Division or District Engineer in cases where responsibilities and interests of the Corps of Engineers would be affected. The report should include discussion of Corps interests which could result in recommendations for provisions to be included in a subsequent license. In general proposed construction of power facilities at or in conjunction with a Corps reservoir project will be reviewed with the objective of recommending design, construction and operation factors that the applicant must consider in its studies in order for the proposed power development to be compatible, physically and economically, with the authorized function of the Corps project(s).

    (g)  In investigation of an application for FERC license or permit, consideration will be given to aspects of the project affecting authorized functions of the Corps as well as to the responsibilities assigned to the Corps by the Federal Power Act. Accordingly, the Division engineer in his report on an application to the Chief of Engineers will always consider the necessity for including in any license or permit terms and conditions to protect the interests of navigation. Recommendations involving other responsibilities of the Corps in the area of water control management such as flood control, low flow augmentation minimum instantaneous releases, and other purposes should also be considered.

    (h)  Appendix B to this Regulation includes standard terms and conditions used by the FERC in licenses for projects affecting navigable waters of the U.S. The standard articles, included in appendix B, are identified by the FERC in the following Forms:

    (1) Form L-3 (Revised October 1975)

    (2) Form L-4 (Revised October 1975)

    (i)  (1) The following procedures are currently being followed in connection with Department of Army permit responsibilities involving pre-1920 legislation:

    (i) In regard to FERC licensing of projects, Corps responsibilities under section 10 of the River and Harbor Act of 1899, for power related activities, may normally be met through the FERC licensing procedure including insertion of terms and conditions in the license of the interest of navigation. Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act provides for approval of plans of project works by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of the Army from the standpoint of interests of navigation. The consideration for our approval under section 4(e) will be limited to effects of project power related activities on navigation.

    (ii) Applications to Corps Division or District Engineers for approval of repairs, maintenance or modification of non-Federal water power projects authorized under River and Harbor Acts as well as special Acts of Congress prior to 1920, or requests for advice with respect thereto should be referred to the FERC for consideration in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act. The permittee should be advised that the application is being referred to the FERC for consideration and that if a FERC license is required Corps recommendations will be furnished to the FERC.

    (2) Responsibilities under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended in 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1151) pertinent to discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites will be met only through the Department of Army permit procedures as specified in ER 1145-2-303. In regard to FERC cases involving section 404, our report to the FERC through (DAEN-CWE-HY) will specify the need for a Department of Army permit (section 404) if, on the basis of the Division and District Engineers' reports, such permit is deemed necessary. A Department of the Army permit will be required for any portion of a proposed project which involves the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States. This includes the placement of fill necessary for construction of a project's dam and appurtenant structures.

    (3) When applicable, FERC will be advised that the requirement for Department of the Army permit pursuant to section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 for the transport of dredged material from the project site for the purpose of dumping it into the ocean waters will be met only through the Department of the Army permit program.

    (4) In connection with FERC licensed projects there may be proposed non-power water oriented activities, such as recreational development, which are associated with the overall project but may not be a part of the hydroelectric power facilities at the project. Such cases, if involving navigable waters should be reviewed from the standpoint of need for a section 10 permit. Such section 10 permit actions would involve consideration of the overall public interest, including water quality, fish and wildlife, recreation, general environmental concerns and the needs and welfare of the people. Corps responsibilities for permit requirements under section 10 of the River and Harbor Act of 1899 for nonpower activities affecting navigable waters at the FERC projects will be met only through the Corps permit procedures. The Corps' report to FERC through (DAEN-CWE-HY) will specify the need for such permit when recommended by the Division and District Engineers' report.

    (j)  The period of the FERC license for hydroelectric projects is usually 50 years. During and/or upon the expiration of the period of a license, a licensee may file with the FERC an application for surrender or termination of its license. These applications may encompass requests for physical removal of an existing dam and/or powerhouse structures from a stream. Division Engineers who would be assigned by the Chief of Engineers to review such applications will consider, in their review and report to DAEN-CWE-HY, the possibility that sediment discharge resulting from removal of a dam structure from a navigable river or from any site that may affect navigable waters would impair the anchorage and navigation and/or flood carrying capacity of the stream. In cases where there is a possibility of significant downstream shoaling (sedimentation) as the result of removal of a dam and its appurtenant structures, recommendation may be made to the FERC, through DAEN-CWE-HY, requiring licensee as a condition of approval of dam removal to agree to bear the expense for removal of any shoaling at the navigable river(s) which would be determined by the Corps to be detrimental to navigation. Other recommendations to be considered include gradual lowering of a dam over a period of time and/or possibility of sediment removal prior to dam removal. It should also be noted that a Department of the Army permit under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1151), as discussed in Paragraph 9b of this regulation, may be needed in connection with removal of dams on or affecting the navigable waters if a discharge of dredged or fill material also occurs during the removal operation. Other recommendations within the Corps authority that should be considered in reviewing applications for surrender or termination of licenses for projects where their power facilities have been removed, or recommended for removal, is that upon any approval of such application by the FERC, continuation of existence of the nonpower project on or affecting the navigable waters of the U.S. will require a Department of the Army permit in compliance with section 10 of the River and Harbor Act of 1899. Furthermore, it should be noted that in the absence of FERC nonpower use license, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 808(b), the structural safety and maintenance of dam and reservoir for a nonpower project will be governed by the laws and regulations of the State in which the project is located.

    (k)  Corps Division and District Engineers responsibilities with respect to any project affecting navigable waters include surveillance of operation and maintenance to insure that the interests of navigation are not adversely affected. In addition, in certain cases the Corps, at the request of the FERC, may act as agent for the FERC for overall supervision of project operation and maintenance. Corps Division Engineers have, in the past, represented the FERC in supervision and inspection of a number of FERC licensed projects within their respective divisions. The Commission by letter dated March 4, 1976 relieved the Corps of Engineers from acting as the Commission's representative for supervision and inspection of its licensed projects. This responsibility has been transferred by the Commission to its own regional engineers. There are no requirements for any periodic or annual reports from the Division offices regarding the operation of FERC licensed hydroelectric projects. However, Division Engineers will report to DAEN-CWE-HY on a current basis any significant detrimental effects with respect to Corps of Engineers responsibilities or other matters which come to their attention.

    (l)  The Dam Safety Act, Public Law 92-367, provides that dams constructed pursuant to licenses issued under the authority of the Federal Power Act are specifically exempted from the national inspection program administered by the Corps. However, the law further provides that the Secretary of the Army upon request of the FERC may inspect dams which have been licensed under the Federal Power Act. The Commission by letter dated August 29, 1972 informed the Corps that the Commission does not expect to request the Corps' assistance for inspecting the projects licensed under the Federal Power Act.

    (m)  In cases where the FERC may request the Corps to supervise the actual construction of licensed hydroelectric project on behalf of the Commission, instructions will be furnished to the appropriate District Engineer through the Division Engineer at the time the request is made.

    (n)  Corps of Engineers operations under the Federal Power Act also include participation in FERC procedures in determining headwater benefits from Corps reservoir projects (RCS, 1461-FPC). This matter is discussed in ER 1140-2-1.

    (o)  (1) The salaries of the Corps of Engineers personnel involved in investigations discussed herein will be charged against funds for “Special Investigations” under the appropriation for “General Expenses.” The FERC may provide reimbursement if requested by the Chief of Engineers to cover the nonpersonal expenses which may be incurred in the investigation and supervision of projects under permits and licenses.

    (2) Non-personal costs amounting to less than $100 for any single investigation will not be reimbursed from the Commission funds but will be charged also to “Special Investigations” under the appropriations for “General Expenses.” Each Division Engineer charged with a detailed investigation of an application for license or the supervision of a project that will require more than a nominal amount of nonpersonal costs will be specifically requested to submit an estimate of the funds required upon assignment of the work by the Chief of Engineers.

    (3) Reimbursement from the FERC funds for nonpersonal costs in excess of $100 will be made by the Chief of Engineers upon submission of a voucher on Standard Form 1080 by the District Engineer through the Division Engineer. The voucher will show the fiscal year during which the work was done and the Commission project number on which the money was spent.

  PART 222—ENGINEERING AND DESIGN

### Part 222

**Authority:** Authority: 23 U.S.C. 116(d); delegation in 49 CFR 1.45(b); 33 U.S.C. 467  33 U.S.C. 701, 701b, and 701c-1 and specific legislative authorization Acts and Public Laws listed in appendix E of § 222.7.

    § 222.2   Acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for hydrologic safety purposes.

#### § § 222.2

    (a)  This regulation provides guidance on the acquisition of lands downstream from spillways for the purpose of protecting the public from hazards imposed by spillway discharges. Guidance contained herein is in addition to ER 405-2-150.

    (b)  This regulation is applicable to all OCE elements and all field operating agencies having civil works responsibilities.

    (c)  ER 405-2-150.

    (d)  A policy of public safety awareness will be adhered to in all phases of design and operation of dam and lake projects to assure adequate security for the general public in areas downstream from spillways. A real estate interest will be required in those areas downstream of a spillway where spillway discharge could create or significantly increase a hazardous condition. The real estate interest will extend downstream to where the spillway discharge would not significantly increase hazards. A real estate interest is not required in areas where flood conditions would clearly be nonhazardous.

    (e)  The construction and operation of a dam and spillway may create or aggravate a potential hazard in the spillway discharge area. Therefore, an appropriate solution should be developed in a systematic manner. All pertinent facts need to be considered to assure that the risk to non-Federal interests does not exceed conditions that would prevail without the project. General hydrologic engineering considerations are as follows:

    (1)  Pool elevation versus probability of filling relationships can change materially after initial construction. Spillway use may be more frequent than anticipated. The infrequent use of a spillway is not a basis for the lack of adequate downstream real estate interest.

    (2)  Water resource needs within river basins change and pool levels may be adjusted to provide more conservation storage, particularly when high-level limited-service spillways are provided. Such changes normally increase spillway use and are to be considered.

    (3)  The amount of flow and destructive force of the flow from a spillway during floods up to the spillway design flood can vary from insignificant to extremely hazardous magnitudes. The severity and area of hazard associated with spillway discharge will vary depending on specific project site conditions. Therefore, the hazard is to be analyzed on a project-by-project basis.

    (4)  If development within the floodway downstream from a spillway is not present at the time of project construction, the existence of the reservoir may encourage development. Adverse terrain conditions do not preclude development. Sparse present development is not a basis for lack of real estate acquisition.

    (5)  The availability of erodible material in a spillway flow area intensifies the hazards of spillway flow. In fact, debris may be transported to downstream areas that otherwise would not be adversely affected. Extreme erosion may result from high velocities and turbulence. Both debris and erosion must be evaluated and considered.

    (6)  Small projects generally have short time periods available to warn downstream inhabitants and may be unattended prior to spillway use. The ability to convince individuals to leave most of their worldly possessions to the ravages of spillway flow may be severely limited. In some cases flood warning systems may be necessary; however, this subject is beyond the scope of this regulation. Warning systems are not an adequate substitute for a real estate interest in lands downstream of spillways.

    (7)  Spillways should be located to minimize the hazards associated with their discharge and the total project cost (cost of spillway structure and downstream lands). Spillways, outlet works, stilling basins, and outlet channels should be designed to minimize hazards to downstream interest insofar as is engineeringly and economically reasonable.

    (f)  The real estate interest required downstream of spillways will be adequate to assure carrying out project purposes and to protect non-Federal interest from hazards created by spillway flows. The interest may be either fee or permanent easement. A permanent easement must exclude all overnight and/or permanent habitation, structures subject to damage by spillway flows and activities that would increase the potential hazards. No real estate interest is required for:

    (1) Areas where the imposed or aggravated flood condition is non-hazardous. Affected interest should be informed of the nature of the imposed non-hazardous flood condition.

    (2) Areas where the construction and operation of a dam and spillway do not increase or create a hazardous condition.

    (g)  In some cases land downstream from spillways can be effectively used for purposes other than hydrologic safety. Therefore, the entire cost of these lands may not be an additional project cost. For example, the lands downstream of a spillway may be used for wildlife management essential to project purposes in lieu of other lands suitable for similar purposes at another location.

    (h)  Procedures regarding the application of the principles outlined in the above paragraphs are as follows:

    (1) For various flood magnitudes up to the probable maximum flood determine the “with” and “without project” flood conditions downstream of a dam spillway for the following:

    (i) Flooded area.

    (ii) Flood depth.

    (iii) Flood duration.

    (iv) Velocities.

    (v) Debris and erosion.

    (2) Determine the combinations of flood magnitudes and the above flood conditions that could be the most hazardous and/or result in the greatest increase in hazard from “without” to “with project” flood conditions. Designate these combinations of flood magnitude and flood conditions as the critical conditions.

    (3) For the critical conditions selected above outline the areas where the project could increase and/or create (impose) one or more of the critical conditions. Areas where spillway flows do not create or increase flood conditions are excluded from further analysis.

    (4) Determine where the imposed critical conditions as outlined above would be hazardous and non-hazardous. Non-hazardous areas are defined as those areas where:

    (i) Flood depths are maximum of 2 feet in urban and rural areas.

    (ii) Flood depths are essentially non-damaging to urban property.

    (iii) Flood durations are a maximum of 3 hours in urban areas and 24 hours in agricultural areas.

    (iv) Velocities do not exceed 4 feet per second.

    (v) Debris and erosion potentials are minimal.

    (vi) Imposed flood conditions would be infrequent. That is, the exceedence frequency should be less than 1 percent. Hazardous areas are those where any of the above criteria are exceeded.

    (5) Based upon the information developed above and the principles outlined in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, decide on the extent of area and estate required for hydrologic safety purposes.

    (i)  Lands to be acquired downstream from spillways and intended purposes will be identified and the cost included in feasibility reports and real estate design memoranda. Additional specific information in support of land acquisition should be provided in Phase I or Phase II general design memoranda (GDM) and dam modernization reports. This information should include topographic maps, area flooded maps, velocities, erosion and debris areas “with” and “without” the project. Real estate boundaries and discussions of items in paragraph (h)(4) are also essential in the GDM's and dam modernization reports.

    § 222.3   Clearances for power and communication lines over reservoirs.

#### § § 222.3

    (a)  This regulation prescribes the minimum vertical clearances to be provided when relocating existing or constructing new power and communication lines over waters of reservoir projects.

    (b)  This regulation applies to all field operating agencies having Civil Works responsibilities.

    (c)  (1) ER 1180-1-1 (Section 73).

    (2) National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2), available from IEEE Service Center, 445 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, N.J. 08854.

    (d) —(1)  The design high water level above which clearances are to be provided shall be either: (i) The elevation of the envelope profile of the 50 year flood, or flood series, routed through the reservoir with a full conservation pool after 50 years of sedimentation, or (ii) the elevation of the top of the flood control pool, whichever is higher.

    (2)  The low point of the line shall be the elevation of the lowest point of the line taking into consideration all factors including temperature, loading and length of spans as outlined in the National Electrical Safety Code.

    (3)  The minimum vertical clearance shall be the distance from the design high water lever (paragraph (d)(1) of this section) to the low point of the line (paragraph (d)(2) of this section).

    (e)  Minimum vertical clearances for power and communication lines over reservoirs shall not be less than required by section 23, rule 232 of the latest revision of the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2).

    (1) In general, minimum vertical clearances shall not be less than shown in Table 232-1, Item 7, of ANSI C2, even for reservoirs or areas not suitable for sailboating or where sailboating is prohibited.

    (2) If clearances not in accordance with Table 232-1 of ANSI C2 are proposed, justification for the clearances should be provided.

    (f)  For parts of reservoirs that are designated as navigable waters of the United States, greater clearances will be provided if so required. The clearances required over navigable waters are covered by 33 CFR 322.5(i)(2) and are not affected by this regulation.

    § 222.4   Reporting earthquake effects.

#### § § 222.4

    (a)  This regulation states policy, defines objectives, assigns functions, and establishes procedures for assuring the structural integrity and operational adequacy of major Civil Works structures following the occurrence of significant earthquakes. It primarily concerns damage surveys following the occurrences of earthquakes.

    (b)  This regulation is applicable to all field operating agencies having Civil Works responsibilities.

    (c)  (1) ER 1110-2-100 (§ 222.2).

    (2) ER 1110-2-1806.

    (3) ER 1110-2-8150.

    (4) ER 1130-2-419.

    (5) State-of-the-Art for Assessing Earthquake Hazards in the United States—WES Miscellaneous Papers S-73-1—Reports 1 thru 14. Available from U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, P.O. Box 631, Vicksburg, Mississippi 39180.

    (d)  Civil Works structures which could be caused to fail or partially fail by an earthquake and whose failure or partial failure would endanger the lives of the public and/or cause substantial property damage, will be evaluated following potentially damaging earthquakes to insure their continued structural stability, safety and operational adequacy. These structures include dams, navigation locks, powerhouses, and appurtenant structures, (intakes, outlet works, buildings, tunnels, paved spillways) which are operated by the Corps of Engineers and for which the Corps is fully responsible. Also included are major levees, floodwalls, and similar facilities designed and constructed by the Corps of Engineers and for whose structural safety and stability the Corps has a public obligation to be aware of although not responsible for their maintenance and operation. The evaluation of these structures will be based upon post-earthquake inspections which will be conducted to detect conditions of significant structural distress and to provide a basis for timely initiation of restorative and remedial measures.

    (e) —(1)  The design of structures for earthquake loading is limited by the infrequent opportunity to compare actual performance with the design. Damage which would affect the function of the project is unlikely if peak accelerations are below 0.1g.; but it cannot be assumed that a structure will not be damaged from earthquake loadings below that for which it was designed. Furthermore, earthquakes have occurred in several parts of the country where significant seismic activity had not been predicted by some seismic zoning maps. This indicates the possibility that earthquake induced loads may not have been adequately considered in the design of older structures.

    (2)  Many types of structural damage can be induced by ground motion from earthquakes or from large nuclear blasts (which also tend to induce ground vibrations in the more damaging lower frequency ranges). Any post-earthquake change in appearance or functional capability of a major Civil Works structure should be evaluated and reported. Examples are symptoms of induced stresses in buildings made evident by cracked plaster, windows or tile, or in binding of doors or windows; cracked or shifted bridge pier footings or other concrete structures; turbidity or changed static level of water wells; cracks in concrete dams or earth embankments; and misalignment of hydraulic control structures or gates. Induced dynamic loading on earth dams may result in loss of freeboard by settlement, or cause localized quick conditions within the embankment sections or earth foundations. Also, new seepage paths may be opened up within the foundation or through the embankment section. Ground motion induced landslides may occur in susceptible areas of the reservoir rim, causing embankment overtopping by waves and serious damage. All such unusual conditions should be evaluated and reported.

    (f)  (1) If the project is located in an area where the earthquake causes significant damage (Modified Mercalli Intensity VII or greater) to structures in the vicinity, the Chief, Engineering Division, should be immediately notified and an engineering evaluation and inspection team should be sent to the project.

    (2) If the project is located in an area where the earthquake is felt but causes no or insignificant damage (Modified Mercalli Intensity VI or less) to structures in the vicinity of the project, project operations personnel should make an immediate inspection. This inspection should determine: (i) Whether there is evidence of earthquake damage or disturbance, and (ii) whether seismic instrumentation, where present, has been triggered. The Chief, Engineering Division should be notified by phone of the results of the inspection. If damage is observed, which is considered to threaten the immediate safety or operational capability of the project, immediate action should be taken as covered in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For other situations, the Chief of Engineering Division will determine the need for and urgency for an engineering inspection.

    (3) When an engineering inspection of structures is deemed necessary following a significant earthquake, HQDA (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314 will be notified of the inspection program as soon as it is established.

    (4) As a general rule, the structures which would be of concern following an earthquake are also the structures which are involved in the inspection program under ER 1110-2-100. Whenever feasible, instrumentation and prototype testing programs undertaken under ER 1110-2-100 to monitor structural performance and under ER 1110-2-8150 to develop design criteria will be utilized in the post-earthquake safety evaluation programs. Additional special types of instrumentation will be incorporated in selected structures in which it may be desirable to measure forces, pressures, loads, stresses, strains, displacements, deflections, or other conditions relating to damage and structural safety and stability in case of an earthquake.

    (5) Where determined necessary, a detailed, systematic engineering inspection will be made of the post-earthquake condition of each structure, taking into account its distinctive features. For structures which have incurred earthquake damage a formal technical report will be prepared in a format similar to inspection reports required under ER 1110-2-100. (Exempt from requirements control under paragraph 7-2b, AR 335-15.) The report will include summaries of the instrumentation and other observation data for each inspection, for permanent record and reference purposes. This report will be used to form a basis for major remedial work when required. Where accelerometers or other types of strong motion instruments have been installed, readings and interpretations from these instruments should also be included in the report. The report will contain recommendations for remedial work when appropriate, and will be transmitted through the Division Engineer for review and to HQDA (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314 for review and approval. For structures incurring no damage a simple statement to this effect will be all that is required in the report, unless seismic instrumentation at the project is activated. (See paragraph (h)(4) of this section.)

    (g)  The dam safety training program covered by paragraph 6 of ER 1130-2-419 should include post-earthquake inspections and the types of damage operations personnel should look for.

    (h)  (1) The Engineering Divisions of the District offices will formulate the inspection program, conduct the post-earthquake inspections, process and analyze the data of instrumental and other observations, evaluate the resulting condition of the structures, and prepare the inspection reports. The Engineering division is also responsible for planning special instrumentation felt necessary in selected structures under this program. Engineering Division is responsible for providing the training discussed in paragraph (g) of this section.

    (2) The Construction Divisions of the District offices will be responsible for the installation of the earthquake instrumentation devices and for data collection if an earthquake occurs during the construction period.

    (3) The Operations Division of the District offices will be responsible for the immediate assessment of earthquake damage and notifying the Chief, Engineering Division as discussed in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2). The Operations Division will also be responsible for earthquake data collection after the construction period in accordance with the instrumental observation programs, and will assist and participate in the post-earthquake inspections.

    (4) The U.S. Geological Survey has the responsibility for servicing and collecting all data from strong motion instrumentation at Corps of Engineers dam projects following an earthquake occurrence. However, the U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station (WES) is assigned the responsibility for analyzing and interpreting these earthquake data. Whenever a recordable earthquake record is obtained from seismic instrumentation at a Corps project, the Division will send a report of all pertinent instrumentation data to the Waterways Experiment Station, ATTN: WESGH, P.O. Box 631, Vicksburg, Mississippi 39180. The report on each project should include a complete description of the locations and types of instruments and a copy of the instrumental records from each of the strong motion machines activated. (Exempt from requirements control under paragraph 7-2v, AR 335-15).

    (5) The Engineering Divisions of the Division offices will select structures for special instrumentation for earthquake effects, and will review and monitor the data collection, processing, evaluating, and inspecting activities. They will also be specifically responsible for promptly informing HQDA (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314, when evaluation of the condition of the structure or analyses of the instrumentation data indicate the stability of a structure is questionable. (Exempt for requirements control under paragraph 7-2o, AR 335-15.)

    (6) Division Engineers are responsible for issuing any supplementary regulations necessary to adapt the policies and instructions herein to the specific conditions within their Division.

    (i)  Funding for the evaluation and inspection program will be under the Appropriation 96X3123, Operations and Maintenance, General. Funds required for the inspections, including Travel and Per Diem costs incurred by personnel of the Division office or the Office, Chief of Engineers, will be from allocations made to the various projects for the fiscal year in which the inspection occurs.

    (d) —(1)  _Authorities_ for allocation of storage and regulation of projects owned and operated by the Corps of Engineers are contained in legislative authorization acts and referenced project documents. These public laws and project documents usually contain provisions for development of water control plans, and appropriate revisions thereto, under the discretionary authority of the Chief of Engineers. Some modifications in project operation are permitted under congressional enactments subsequent to original project authorization. Questions that require interpretations of authorizations affecting regulation of specific reservoirs will be referred to CDR USACE (DAEN-CWE-HW), WASH DC 20314, with appropriate background information and analysis, for resolution.

    (2)  The Corps of Engineers is responsible for prescribing flood control and navigation regulations for certain reservoir projects constructed or operated by other Federal, non-Federal or private agencies. There are several classes of such projects: Those authorized by special acts of Congress; those for which licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (formerly Federal Power Commission) provide that operation shall be in accordance with instructions of the Secretary of the Army; those covered by agreements between the operating agency and the Corps of Engineers; and those that fall under the terms of general legislative and administrative provisions. These authorities, of illustrative examples, are described briefly in Appendix B.

    (e)  (1) Water control plans include coordinated regulation schedules for project/system regulation and such additional provisions as may be required to collect, analyze and disseminate basic data, prepare detailed operating instructions, assure project safety and carry out regulation of projects in an appropriate manner.

    (2) The term “reservoir regulation schedule” refers to a compilation of operating criteria, guidelines, rule curves and specifications that govern basically the storage and release functions of a reservoir. In general, schedules indicate limiting rates of reservoir releases required during various seasons of the year to meet all functional objectives of the particular project, acting separately or in combination with other projects in a system. Schedules are usually expressed in the form of graphs and tabulations, supplemented by concise specifications.

    (f)  (1) Water control plans will be developed for reservoirs, locks and dams, reregulation and major control structures and interrelated systems to conform with objectives and specific provisions of authorizing legislation and applicable Corps of Engineers reports. They will include any applicable authorities established after project construction. The water control plans will be prepared giving appropriate consideration to all applicable Congressional Acts relating to operation of Federal facilities, , Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (Pub. L. 85-624), Federal Water Project Recreation Act-Uniform Policies (Pub. L. 89-72), National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190), and Clean Water Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-217). Thorough analysis and testing studies will be made as necessary to establish the optimum water control plans possible within prevailing constraints.

    (2) Necessary actions will be taken to keep approved water control plans up-to-date. For this purpose, plans will be subject to continuing and progressive study by personnel in field offices of the Corps of Engineers. These personnel will be professionally qualified in technical areas involved and familiar with comprehensive project objectives and other factors affecting water control. Organizational requirements for water control management are further discussed in ER 1110-2-1400.

    (3) Water control plans developed for specific projects and reservoir systems will be clearly documented in appropriate water control manuals. These manuals will be prepared to meet initial requirements when storage in the reservoir begins. They will be revised as necessary to conform with changing requirements resulting from developments in the project area and downstream, improvements in technology, new legislation and other relevant factors, provided such revisions comply with existing Federal regulations and established Corps of Engineers policy.

    (4) Development and execution of water control plans will include appropriate consideration for efficient water management in conformance with the emphasis on water conservation as a national priority. The objectives of efficient water control management are to produce beneficial water savings and improvements in the availability and quality of water resulting from project regulation/operation. Balanced resource use through improved regulation should be developed to conserve as much water as possible and maximize all project functions consistent with project/system management. Continuous examination should be made of regulation schedules, possible need for storage reallocation (within existing authority and constraints) and to identify needed changes in normal regulation. Emphasis should be placed on evaluating conditions that could require deviation from normal release schedules as part of drought contingency plans (ER 1110-2-1941).

    (5) Adequate provisions for collection, analysis and dissemination of basic data, the formulation of specific project regulation directives, and the performance of project regulation will be established at field level.

    (6) Appropriate provisions will be made for monitoring project operations, formulating advisories to higher authorities, and disseminating information to others concerned. These actions are required to facilitate proper regulation of systems and to keep the public fully informed regarding all pertinent water control matters.

    (7) In development and execution of water control plans, appropriate attention will be given to project safety in accordance with ER 1130-2-417 and ER 1130-2-419 so as to insure that all water impounding structures are operated for the safety of users of the facilities and the general public. Care will be exercised in the development of reservoir regulation schedules to assure that controlled releases minimize project impacts and do not jeopardize the safety of persons engaged in activities downstream of the facility. Water control plans will include provisions for issuing adequate warnings or otherwise alerting all affected interests to possible hazards from project regulation activities.

    (8) In carrying out water control activities, Corps of Engineers personnel must recognize and observe the legal responsibility of the National Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for issuing weather forecasts and flood warnings, including river discharges and stages. River forecasts prepared by the Corps of Engineers in the execution of its responsibilities should not be released to the general public, unless the NWS is willing to make the release or agrees to such dissemination. However, release to interested parties of factual information on current storms or river conditions and properly quoted NWS forecasts is permissible. District offices are encouraged to provide assistance to communities and individuals regarding the impact of forecasted floods. Typical advice would be to provide approximate water surface elevations at locations upstream and downstream of the NWS forecasting stream gages. Announcement of anticipated changes in reservoir release rates as far in advance as possible to the general public is the responsibility of Corps of Engineers water control managers for projects under their jurisdiction.

    (9) Water control plans will be developed in concert with all basin interests which are or could be impacted by or have an influence on project regulation. Close coordination will be maintained with all appropriate international, Federal, State, regional and local agencies in the development and execution of water control plans. Effective public information programs will be developed and maintained so as to inform and educate the public regarding Corps of Engineers water control management activities.

    (10) Fiscal year budget requests for water control management activities will be prepared and submitted to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in accordance with requirements established in Engineer Circular on Annual Budget Requests for Civil Works Activities. The total annual costs of all activities and facilities that support the water control functions, (excluding physical operation of projects, but including flood control and navigation regulation of projects subject to 33 CFR 208.11) are to be reported. Information on the Water Control Data Systems and associated Communications Category of the Plant Replacement and Improvement Program will be submitted with the annual budget. Reporting will be in accordance with the annual Engineer Circular on Civil Works Operations and Maintenance, General Program.

    (g) —(1)  Normally, district commanders are primarily responsible for background studies and for developing plans and manuals required for reservoirs, locks and dams, reregulation and major control structures and interrelated systems in their respective district areas. Policies and general guidelines are prescribed by OCE engineer regulations while specific requirements to implement OCE guidance are established by the division commanders concerned. Master Water Control Manuals for river basins that include more than one district are usually prepared by or under direct supervision of division representatives. Division commanders are responsible for providing such management and technical assistance as may be required to assure that plans and manuals are prepared on a timely and adequate basis to meet water control requirements in the division area, and for pertinent coordination among districts, divisions, and other appropriate entities.

    (2) —(i)  The Corps of Engineers will sponsor public involvement activities, as appropriate, to appraise the general public of the water control plan. In developing or modifying water control manuals, the following criteria is applicable.

    (A) Conditions that require public involvement and public meetings include: Development of a new water control manual that includes a water control plan; or revision or update of a water control manual that changes the water control plan.

    (B) Revisions to water control manuals that are administratively or informational in nature and that do not change the water control plan do not require public meetings.

    (C) For those conditions described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the Corps will provide information to the public concerning proposed water control management decisions at least 30 days in advance of a public meeting. In so doing, a separate document(s) should be prepared that explains the recommended water control plan or change, and provides technical information explaining the basis for the recommendation. It should include a description of its impacts (both monetary and nonmonetary) for various purposes, and the comparisons with alternative plans or changes and their effects. The plan or manual will be prepared only after the public involvement process associated with its development or change is complete.

    (D) For those conditions described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the responsible division office will send each proposed water control manual to the Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters, Attn: CECW-EH-W for review and comments prior to approval by the responsible division office.

    (ii)  The water control manual will be made available for examination by the general public upon request at the appropriate office of the Corps of Engineers. Public notice shall be given in the event of occurring or anticipated significant changes in reservoir storage or flow releases. The method of conveying this information shall be commensurate with the urgency of the situation and the lead time available.

    (3)  Division commanders are delegated authority for approval of water control plans and manuals, and associated activities.

    (4)  OCE will establish policies and guidelines applicable to all field offices and for such actions as are necessary to assure a reasonable degree of consistency in basic policies and practices in all Division areas. Assistance will be provided to field offices during emergencies and upon special request.

    (5)  Division and district commanders are responsible for conducting appropriate programs for improving technical methods applicable to water control activities in their respective areas. Suitable training programs should be maintained to assure a satisfactory performance capability in water control activities. Appropriate coordination of such programs with similar activities in other areas will be accomplished to avoid duplication of effort, and to foster desirable exchange of ideas and developments. Initiative in re-evaluating methods and guidelines previously established in official documents referred to in paragraph (e) of this section is encouraged where needs are evident. However, proposals for major deviations from basic concepts, policies and general practices reflected in official publications will be submitted to CDR USACE (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314 for concurrence or comment before being adopted for substantial application in actual project regulation at field level.

    (h)  (1) Directives issued through OCE Engineer Regulations will be used to foster consistency in policies and basic practices. They will be supplemented as needed by other forms of communication.

    (2) Engineering Manuals (EM) and Engineer Technical Letters (ETL) are issued by OCE to serve as general guidelines and technical aids in developing water control plans and manuals for individual projects or systems.

    (3) EM 1110-2-3600 discusses principles and concepts involved in developing water control plans. Instructions relating to preparation of “Water Control Manuals for specific projects” are included. EM 1110-2-3600 should be used as a general guide to water control activities. The instructions are sufficiently flexible to permit adaptation to specific regions. Supplemental information regarding technical methods is provided in numerous documents distributed to field offices as “hydrologic references.”

    (4) Special assistance in technical studies is available from the Hydrologic Engineering Center, Corps of Engineers, 609 Second Street, Davis, California 95616 and DAEN-CWE-HW.

    (i)  (1) As used herein, the term “water control manual” refers to manuals that relate primarily to the functional regulation of an individual project or system of projects. Although such manuals normally include background information concerning physical features of projects, they do not prescribe rules or methods for physical maintenance or care of facilities, which are covered in other documents. (References 15 and 23, appendix A.)

    (2) Water control manuals prepared in substantially the detail and format specified in instructions referred to in paragraph 8 are required for all reservoirs under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers, regardless of the purpose or size of the project. Water Control manuals are also required for lock and dam, reregulation and major control structure projects that are physically regulated by the Corps of Engineers. Where there are several projects in a drainage basin with interrelated purposes, a “Master Manual” shall be prepared. The effects of non-Corps projects will be considered in appropriate detail, including an indication of provisions for interagency coordination.

    (3) “Preliminary water control manuals,” for projects regulated by the Corps of Engineers should contain regulation schedules in sufficient detail to establish the basic plan of initial project regulation.

    (4) As a general rule, preliminary manuals should be superseded by more detailed interim or “final” manuals within approximately one year after the project is placed in operation.

    (5) Each water control manual will contain a section on special regulations to be conducted during emergency situations, including droughts. Preplanned operations and coordination are essential to effective relief or assistance.

    (6) One copy of all water control manuals and subsequent revisions shall be forwarded to DAEN-CWE-HW for file purposes as soon as practicable after completion, preferably within 30 days from date of approval at the division level.

    (j)  (1) Division and district commanders will develop water control plans as required by section 7 of the 1944 Flood Control Act, the Federal Power Act and section 9 of Pub. L. 436-83 for all projects located within their areas, in conformance with ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208. That regulation prescribes the policy and general procedures for regulating reservoir projects capable of regulation for flood control or navigation, except projects owned and operated by the Corps of Engineers; the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico; those under the jurisdiction of the International Joint Commission, United States and Canada, and the Columbia River Treaty. ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 permits the promulgation of specific regulations for a project in compliance with the authorizing acts, when agreement on acceptable regulations cannot be reached between the Corps Engineers and the owners. Appendix B provides a summary of the Corps of Engineers responsibilities for prescribing regulations for non-Corps reservoir projects.

    (2) Water control plans will be developed and processed as soon as possible for applicable projects already completed and being operated by other entities, including projects built by the Corps of Engineers and turned over to others for operation.

    (3) In so far as practicable, water control plans for non-Corps projects should be developed in cooperation with owning/operating agencies involved during project planning stages. Thus, tentative agreements on contents, including pertinent regulation schedules and diagrams, can be accomplished prior to completion of the project.

    (4) The magnitude and nature of storage allocations for flood control or navigation purposes in non-Corps projects are governed basically by conditions of project authorizations or other legislative provisions and may include any or all of the following types of storage assignments:

    (i) Year-round allocations: Storage remains the same all year.

    (ii) Seasonal allocations: Storage varies on a fixed seasonal basis.

    (iii) Variable allocations of flood control from year to year, depending on hydrologic parameters, such as snow cover.

    (5) Water control plans should be developed to attain maximum flood control or navigation benefits, consistent with other project requirements, from the storage space provided for these purposes. When reservoir storage capacity of the category referred to in paragraph (j)(4)(iii) is utilized for flood control or navigation, jointly with other objectives, the hydrologic parameters and related rules developed under provisions of ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 should conform as equitably as possible with the multiple-purpose objectives established in project authorizations and other pertinent legislation.

    (6) Storage allocations made for flood control or navigation purposes in non-Corps projects are not subject to modifications by the Corps of Engineers as a prerequisite for prescribing 33 CFR 208.11 regulations. However, regulations developed for use of such storage should be predicated on a mutual understanding between representatives of the Corps and the operating agency concerning the conditions of the allocations in order to assure reasonable achievement of basic objectives intended. In the event field representatives of the Corps of Engineers, and the operating agency are unable to reach necessary agreements after all reasonable possibilities have been explored, appropriate background explanations and recommendations should be submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW for consideration.

    (7) The Chief of Engineers is responsible for prescribing regulations for use of flood control or navigation storage and/or project operation under the provisions of the referenced legislative acts. Accordingly, any regulations established should designate the division/district commander who is responsible to the Chief of Engineers as the representative to issue any special instructions required under the regulation. However, to the extent practicable, project regulations should be written to permit operation of the project by the owner without interpretations of the regulations by the designated representative of the Commander during operating periods.

    (8) Responsibility for compliance with 33 CFR 208.11 regulations rests with the operating agency. The division or district commander of the area in which the project is located will be kept informed regarding project operations to verify reasonable conformance with the regulations. The Chief of Engineers or his designated representative may authorize or direct deviation from the established water control plan when conditions warrant such deviation. In the event unapproved deviations from the prescribed regulations seem evident, the division or district commander concerned will bring the matter to the attention of the operating agency by appropriate means.

    (9) Regulations should contain information regarding the required exchange of basic data between the representative of the operating agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that are pertinent to regulation and coordination of interrelated projects in the region.

    (10) All 33 CFR 208.11 regulations shall contain provisions authorizing the operating agency to temporarily deviate from the regulations in the event that it is necessary for emergency reasons to protect the safety of the dam, to avoid health hazards, and to alleviate other critical situations.

    (k)  Guidelines concerning technical studies and development of regulations are contained in ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 and EM 1110-2-3600. Appendix C of this regulation summarizes steps normally followed in developing and processing regulations for non-Corps projects.

    (l)  Water control plans discussed in preceding paragraphs are intended primarily for application after the dam, spillway and outlet structures; major relocations; land acquisitions, administrative arrangements and other project requirements have reached stages that permit relatively normal project regulation. With respect to non-Corps projects, regulations normally become applicable when water control agreements have been signed by the designated signatories, subject to special provisions in specific cases. In some instances, implementation of regulations has been delayed by legal provisions, contract limitations, or other considerations. These delays can result in loss of potential project benefits and possible hazards. Accordingly, it is essential that appropriate water control and contingency plans be established for use from the date any storage may accumulate behind a partially completed dam until the project is formally accepted for normal operations. Division commanders shall make certain that construction-stage regulation plans are established and maintained in a timely and adequate manner for projects under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers. In addition, the problems referred to should be discussed with authorities who are responsible for non-Corps projects, with the objective of assuring that such projects operate as safely and effectively as possible during the critical construction stage and any period that may elapse before regular operating arrangements have been established. These special regulation plans should include consideration for protection of construction operations; safety of downstream interests that might be jeopardized by failure of partially completed embankments; requirements for minimizing adverse effects on partially completed relocations or incomplete land acquisition; and the need for obtaining benefits from project storage that can be safely achieved during the construction and early operation period.

    (m) —(1)  Division commanders will keep the Chief of Engineers currently informed of any unusual problems or activities associated with water control that impact on his responsibilities.

    (2)  Division commanders will submit an annual report on water control management activities within their division. The annual report will be submitted to (DAEN-CWE-HW) by 1 February each year and cover significant activities of the previous water year and a description of activities to be accomplished for the current year. Funding information for water control activities will be provided in the letter of transmittal for in-house use only. The primary objective of this summary is to keep the Chief of Engineers informed regarding overall water management activities Corps-wide, thus providing a basis to carry out OCE responsibilities set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.

    (3)  A brief discussion shall be prepared annually by each division commander, as a separate section of the annual report on water control management activities discussed in paragraph (m)(2) of this section listing all projects currently in operation in his area, or expected to begin operation within one-year, with a designation of the status of water control manuals. The report should also list projects for which the Corps of Engineers is responsible for prescribing regulations, as defined in ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208.

    (4)  A monthly record of reservoirs/lakes operated by the Corps of Engineers and other agencies, in accordance with 33 CFR 208.11, will be promptly prepared and maintained by district/division commanders in a form readily available for transmittal to the Chief of Engineers, or others, upon request. Record data may be prepared in either graphical form as shown in EM 1110-2-3600, or tabular form as shown in the sample tabulation in appendix D.

    (5)  By Executive Order 12088, the President ordered the head of each Executive Agency to be responsible for ensuring that all necessary actions are taken for prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution with respect to Federal facilities and activities under control of the agency. General guidance is provided in references 24 and 25, appendix A, for carrying out this agency's responsibility. Annual division water quality reports are required by reference 24, appendix A. The report is submitted in two parts. The first part addresses the division Water quality management plan while the second part presents specific project information. A major objective of this report is to summarize information pertinent to water quality aspects of overall water management responsibilities. The annual division water quality report may be submitted along with the annual report on water control management activities discussed in paragraph 13b above.

    (6)  (i) A water control data system is all of the equipment within a division which is used to acquire, process, display and distribute information for real-time project regulation and associated interagency coordination. A subsystem is all equipment as defined previously within a district. A network is all equipment as defined previously which is used to regulate a single project or a group of projects which must be regulated interdependently.

    (ii) Master plans for water control data systems and significant revisions thereto will be prepared by division water control managers and submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW by 1 February each year for review and approval of engineering aspects. Engineering approval does not constitute funding approval. After engineering approval is obtained, equipment in the master plan is eligible for consideration in the funding processes described in ER 1125-2-301 and engineering circulars on the annual budget request for civil works activities. Master plans will be maintained current and will:

    (A) Outline the system performance requirements, including those resulting from any expected expansions of Corps missions.

    (B) Describe the extent to which existing facilities fulfill performance requirements.

    (C) Describe alternative approaches which will upgrade the system to meet the requirements not fulfilled by existing facilities, or are more cost effective than the existing system.

    (D) Justify and recommend a system considering timeliness, reliability, economics and other factors deemed important.

    (E) Delineate system scope, implementation schedules, proposed annual capital expenditures by district, total costs, and sources of funding.

    (iii) Modified master plans should be submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW by 1 February, whenever revisions are required, to include equipment not previously approved or changes in scope or approach. Submittal by the February date will allow adequate time for OCE review and approval prior to annual budget submittals.

    (iv) Division commanders are delegated authority to approve detailed plans for subsystems and networks of approved master plans. Plans approved by the division commander should meet the following conditions:

    (A) The plan conforms to an approved master plan.

    (B) The equipment is capable of functioning independently.

    (C) An evaluation of alternatives has been completed considering reliability, cost and other important factors.

    (D) The plan is economically justified, except in special cases where legal requirements dictate performance standards which cannot be economically justified.

    (v) Copies of plans approved by the division commander shall be forwarded to appropriate elements in OCE in support of funding requests and to obtain approval of Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), when applicable.

    (vi) Water control data systems may be funded from Plant Revolving Fund; O&M General; Flood Control, MR&T, and Construction, General. Funding for water control equipment that serves two or more projects will be from Plant Revolving Fund in accordance with ER 1125-2-301. District and division water control managers will coordinate plant revolving fund requests with their respective Plant Replacement and Improvement Program (PRIP) representatives following guidance provided in ER 1125-2-301. Budget funding requests under the proper appropriation title should be submitted only if the equipment is identified in an approved master plan.

    (vii) Justification for the Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) aspects of water control data systems must conform to AR 18-1, Appendix I or J as required. The “Funding for ADPE” paragraph in Appendixes I and J must cite the source of funds and reference relevant information in the approved master plan and detailed plan.

    (viii) Division water control managers will submit annual letter summaries of the status of their respective water control systems and five-year plan for improvements. These summaries will be submitted to DAEN-CWE by 1 June for coordination with DAEN-CWO, CWB and DSZ-A, prior to the annual budget request. Summaries should not be used to obtain approval of significant changes in master plans. Sources of funding for all items for each district and for the division should be delineated so that total system expenditures and funding requests are identified. Changes in the master plan submitted 1 February should be documented in this letter summary if the changes were approved.

    (7)  (i) The Chief of Engineers and staff require information to respond to inquiries from members of Congress and others regarding runoff potentials. Therefore, the division commander will submit a snowmelt runoff and flood potential letter report covering the snow accumulation and runoff period, beginning generally in February and continuing monthly, until the potential no longer exist. Dispatch of supplemental reports will be determined by the urgencies of situations as they occur. The reports will be forwarded as soon as hydrologic data are available, but not later than the 10th of the month. For further information on reporting refer to ER 500-1-1, 33 CFR part 203.

    (ii) During major drought situations or low-flow conditions, narrative summaries of the situation should be furnished to alert the Chief of Engineers regarding the possibility of serious runoff deficiencies that are likely to call for actions associated with Corps of Engineers reservoirs.

    (iii) The reports referred to in paragraphs (m)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section will include general summaries regarding the status of reservoir storage, existing and forecasted at the time of the reports.

    (8)  Information on project regulations to be included in reports submitted to the Chief of Engineers during flood emergencies in accordance with ER 500-1-1 include rate of inflow and outflow in CFS, reservoir levels, predicted maximum level and anticipated date, and percent of flood control storage utilized to date. Maximum use should be made of computerized communication facilities in reporting project status to DAEN-CWO-E/CWE-HW in accordance with the requirements of ER 500-1-1, 33 CFR part 203.

    (9)  Project regulation effects including evaluation of the stage reductions at key stations and estimates of damages prevented by projects will be included in the post flood reports required by ER 500-1-1, 33 CFR part 203.

    (n)  (1) The Columbia River Treaty Permanent Engineering Board was formed in accordance with the Columbia River Treaty with Canada. This board, composed of U.S. and Canadian members, oversees the implementation of the Treaty as carried out by the U.S. and Canadian Entities.

    (2) The Mississippi River Water Control Management Board was established by ER 15-2-13. It consists of the Division Commanders from LMVD, MRD, NCD, ORD, and SWD with the Director of Civil Works serving as chairman. The purposes of the Board are:

    (i) To provide oversight and guidance during the development of basin-wide management plans for Mississippi River Basin projects for which the US Army Corps of Engineers has operation/regulation responsibilities.

    (ii) To serve as a forum for resolution of water control problems among US Army Corps of Engineers Divisions within the Mississippi River Basin when agreement is otherwise unobtainable.

    (o)  Projects owned and operated by the Corps of Engineers subject to this regulation are listed with pertinent data in Appendix E. This list will be updated periodically to include Corps projects completed in the future. Federal legislation, Federal regulations and local agreements have given the Corps of Engineers wide responsibilities for operating projects which it does not own. Non-Corps projects subject to this regulation are included in Appendix A of ER 1110-2-241.

    § 222.6   National Program for Inspection of Non-Federal Dams.

#### § § 222.6

    (a)  This regulation states objectives, assigns responsibilities and prescribes procedures for implementation of a National Program for Inspection of Non-Federal Dams.

    (b)  This regulation is applicable to all Divisions and Districts having Civil Works functions.

    (c)  (1) The National Dam Inspection Act, Pub. L. 92-367, 8 August 1972.

    (2) Freedom of Information Act, Pub. L. 87-487, 4 July 1967.

    (3) ER 500-1-1.

    (d)  The National Dam Inspection Act, Public Law 92-367, 8 August 1972 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to carry out a national program of inspection of non-Federal dams for the purpose of protecting human life and property.

    (e)  The program provides for:

    (1) An update of the National Inventory of Dams.

    (2) Inspection of the following non-Federal dams (the indicated hazard potential categories are based upon the location of the dams relative to developed areas):

    (i) Dams which are in the high hazard potential category (located on Federal and non-Federal lands).

    (ii) Dams in the significant hazard potential category believed by the State to represent an immediate danger to the public safety due to the actual condition of the dam.

    (iii) Dams in the significant hazard potential category located on Federal lands.

    (iv) Specifically excluded from the national inspection program are:

    (A) Dams under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the International Boundary and Water Commission and the Corps of Engineers and

    (B) Dams which have been constructed pursuant to licenses issued under the authority of the Federal Power Act, and

    (C) Dams which have been inspected within the 12-month period immediately prior to the enactment of this act by a State agency and which the Governor of such State requests be excluded from inspection.

    (f)  The objectives of the program are:

    (1) To update the National Inventory of Dams by 30 September 1980.

    (2) To perform the initial technical inspection and evaluation of the non-Federal dams described in paragraph 222.8(e) of this section to identify conditions which constitute a danger to human life or property as a means of expediting the correction of hazardous conditions by non-Federal interests. The inspection and evaluation is to be completed by 30 September 1981.

    (3) To obtain additional information and experience that may be useful in determining if further Federal actions are necessary to assure national dam safety.

    (4) Encourage the States to establish effective dam safety programs for non-Federal dams by 30 September 1981 and assist the States in the development of the technical capability to carry out such a program.

    (g) —(1)  (i) The owner has the basic legal responsibility for potential hazards created by their dam(s). Phase II studies, as described in Chapter 4, Appendix D, and remedial actions are the owner's responsibility.

    (ii) The State has the basic responsibility for the protection of the life and property of its citizens. Once a dam has been determined to be unsafe, it is the State's responsibility to see that timely remedial actions are taken.

    (iii) The Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for executing the national program. The Federal program for inspection of dams does not modify the basic responsibilities of the States or dam owners. The Engineering Division of the Civil Works Directorate is responsible for overall program goals, guidance, technical criteria for inspections and inventory and headquarters level coordination with other agencies. The Water Resources Support Center (WRSC) located at Kingman Building, Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060 is responsible for:

    (A) Program Coordination of both the inventory and inspection programs.

    (B) Developing and defining functional tasks to achieve program objectives.

    (C) Determining resource requirements. (Budget)

    (D) Compiling and disseminating progress reports.

    (E) Monitoring and evaluating program progress and recommending corrective measures as needed.

    (F) Collecting and evaluating data pertaining to inspection reports, dam owners' responses to inspection report recommendations, attitudes and capabilities of State officials, State dam safety legislation, Architect-Engineer performance, etc., for defining a comprehensive national dam safety program.

    (G) Responding to Congressional, media, scientific and engineering organization and general public inquiries.

    (2)  Where State capability exists, every effort should be made to encourage the State to execute the inspection program either with State personnel or with Architect-Engineer (A-E) contracts under State supervision. If the State does not have the capability to carry out the inspection program, the program will be managed by the Corps of Engineers utilizing Corps employees or contracts with A-E firm.

    (h)  (RCS-DAEN-CWE-17/OMB No. 49-RO421)

    (1) The National Inventory of Dams should be updated and verified to include all Federal and non-Federal dams covered by the Act. Those dams are defined as all artificial barriers together with appurtenant works which impound or divert water and which: (1) Are twenty-five feet or more in height or (2) have an impounding capacity of fifty acre-feet or more. Barriers which are six feet or less in height, regardless of storage capacity or barriers which have a storage capacity at maximum water storage elevation of fifteen acre-feet or less regardless of height are not included.

    (2) Inventory data for all dams shall be provided in accordance with appendix B.

    (3) The hazard potential classification shall be in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2  of the Recommended Guideline for Safety Inspection of Dams (Appendix D to this section).

    (4) As in the original development of the inventory, the States should be encouraged to participate in the work of completing, verifying and updating the inventory. Also, when available, personnel of other appropriate Federal agencies should be utilized for the inventory work on a reimbursable basis. Work in any State may be accomplished:

    (i) Under State supervision utilizing State personnel or Architect-Engineers contracts.

    (ii) Under Corps supervision utilizing Corps employees, employees of other Federal agencies or Architect-Engineer contracts.

    (5) A minimum staff should be assigned in Districts and Divisions to administer and monitor the inventory activities. Generally, the work should be accomplished by architect-engineers or other Federal agency personnel under State or Corps supervision. Corps personnel should participate in the inventory only to the extent needed to assure that accurate data are collected.

    (6) The National Inventory of Dams computerized data base in stored on the Boeing Computer Services (BCS) EKS computer system in Seattle, Washington. The data base uses Data Base Management System 2000 and is accessible for query by all Corps offices.

    (7) Appendix B indicates details on accessing and updating inventory data.

    (8) Appendix I describes the procedure for using NASA Land Satellite (LANDSAT) Multispectral Scanner data along with NASA's Surface Water Detection and Mapping (DAM) computer program to assist in updating and verifying and National Inventory of Dams.

    (9) All inventory data for dams will be completed and verified utilizing all available sources of information (including LANDSAT overlay maps) and will include site visitation if required. It is the responsibility of the District Engineer to insure that the inventory of each State within his area of responsibility is accurate and contains the information required by the General Instructions for completing the forms for each Federal and non-Federal dam.

    (i) [Reserved]

    (j)  (RCS-DAEN-CWE-17 and OMB No. 49-RO421)

    (1)  The Governor of each State or his designee will continue to be involved in the selection and scheduling of the dams to be inspected. Priority will be given to inspection of those dams considered to offer the greatest potential threat to public safety.

    (i) No inspection of a dam should be initiated until the hazard potential classification of the dam has been verified to the satisfaction of the Corps. Dams in the significant hazard category should be inspected only if requested by the State and only then if the State can provide information to show that the dam has deficiencies that pose an immediate danger to the public safety. Guidance for the selection of significant category non-Federal dams on Federal lands will be given in the near future.

    (ii) Selection for inspection of non-Federal dams located on Federal lands or non-Federal dams designed and constructed under the jurisdiction of some Federal agency, should be coordinated with the responsible Federal agency. The appropriate State or regional representative of the Federal agency also should be contacted to obtain all available data on the dam. Representatives of the agency may participate in the inspection if they desire and should be given the opportunity to review and comment on the findings and recommendations in the inspection report prior to submission to the Governor and the dam owner. Examples of such dams are: non-Federal dams built on lands managed by National Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, etc.; non-Federal dams designed and constructed by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; high hazard mine tailings and coal mine waste dams under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Department of Labor.

    (iii) Indian-owned dams on trust lands are considered to be non-Federal dams. All dams in the high hazard potential category will be inspected. Privately-owned dams located on Indian lands are to be included in the program, however BIA-owned dams on Indian lands are Federal dams and are exempt.

    (2)  The Division Engineer is responsible for the quality of inspections and reports prepared by the District Engineer. Close liaison between the District Engineer and the State agency or A-E firm responsible for the inspections will be required in order to obtain a dependable result. To avoid undesirable delays in the evaluation of safety of individual dams, contracts with A-E's or agreements with States which are managing the program will provide that reports be completed and furnished to the District Engineer within a specified time after completion of the on-site inspection of the dam.

    (i)  The inspection should be conducted in accordance with the Recommended Guidelines for Safety Inspection of Dams (Appendix D to this section). Expanded Guidance for Hydrologic and Hydraulic Assessment of Dams is provided in appendix C. The criteria in the recommended guidelines are screening criteria to be used only for initial determinations of the adequacy of the dam. Conditions found during the investigation which do not meet the guideline recommendations should be assessed as to their importance from the standpoint of the degree of risk involved.

    (ii)  Experience has shown that coordination and communications among technical disciplines, Public Affairs Office, emergency officials, training officers, operations personnel, State representatives and A-E firms has been best in those districts where one person was delegated the responsibility for coordinating the actions of all involved elements. Each district should evaluate its overall coordination procedures to insure that all involved elements have the best possible access to necessary data.

    (iii) Field investigations should be carried out in a systematic manner. A detailed checklist or inspection form should be developed and used for each dam inspection and appended to the inspection report. The size of the field inspection team should be as small as practicable, generally consisting of only one representative of each required discipline in order to control the costs of the inspection without sacrificing the quality of the inspection. The inspection team for the smaller less complex dams should be limited to two or three representatives from appropriate technical areas with additional specialists used only as special conditions warrant. The larger more complex projects may require inspection teams of three or four specialists. Performance of overly detailed and precise surveys and mapping should be avoided. Necessary measurement of spillway, dam slopes, etc. can generally be made with measuring tapes and hand levels.

    (iv)  Dam inspections should be limited to Phase I investigations as outlined in Chapter 3 of appendix D. However, if recommended by the investigating engineer and approved by the District Engineer, some additional inexpensive investigations may be performed when a reasonable judgment on the safety of the dam cannot be made without additional investigation. Any further Phase II investigation needed to prove or disprove the findings of the District Engineer or to devise remedial measures to correct deficiencies are the responsibility of the owner and will not be undertaken by the Corps of Engineers.

    (v)  (A) The findings of the visual inspection and review of existing engineering data for a dam shall be assessed to determine its general condition. Dams assessed to be in generally good condition should be so described in the inspection report. Deficiencies found in a dam should be described and assessed as to the degree of risk they present. The degree of risk should consider only loss of life and/or property damage resulting from flooding due to dam failure. Loss of project benefits , municipal water supply, etc., should not be considered. If deficiencies are assessed to be of such a nature that, if not corrected, they could result in the failure of the dam with subsequent loss of life and/or substantial property damage, the dam should be assessed as “Unsafe.” If the probable failure of an “Unsafe” dam is judged to be imminent and immediate action is required to reduce or eliminate the hazard, the “unsafe” condition of the dam should be considered an “emergency.” If the probable failure is judged not to be imminent, the “unsafe” condition should be considered a “non-emergency.”

    (B) Adequacy of spillway. The “Recommended Guidelines for Safety Inspection of Dams,” appendix D, provide current, acceptable inspection standards for spillway capacity. Any spillway capacity that does not meet the criteria in the “Guidelines” is considered inadequate. When a spillway's capacity is so deficient that it is seriously inadequate, the project must be considered  If all of the following conditions prevail, the Governor of the State shall be informed that such project is unsafe:

    () There is high hazard to loss of life from large flows downstream of the dam.

    () Dam failure resulting from overtopping would significantly increase the hazard to loss of life downstream from the dam over that which would exist just before overtopping failure.

    () The spillway is not capable of passing one-half of the probable maximum flood without overtopping the dam and causing failure.

    (vi) All inspection reports will receive one level of independent review by the Corps. If the reports are prepared by the Corps, the independent review may be performed internally within the district office. However, in cases which involve significant economic, social or political impacts and technical uncertainties in evaluating the dams, advice may be obtained from the staffs of the Division Engineer and the Office, Chief of Engineers.

    (3) —(i)  A written report on the condition of each dam should be prepared as soon as possible after the completion of the field inspection and assessment. A suggested report format is attached as appendix E. It is important that the inspection report be completed in a timely manner. For inspections being done by Corps employees, it is suggested that once an inspection team has been assigned to a dam inspection it be allowed to complete the inspection and report without interruption by other work.

    (ii)  The coordinating engineer should determine which disciplines should review the report and establish a procedure to accomplish the review in a timely manner. A review panel, made up of the appropriate Division and Branch Chiefs has worked well in some districts. Use of a review panel should be seriously considered by all districts. All inspection reports shall be approved by the District Engineer who will maintain a complete file of final approved reports. Any State or Federal agency having jurisdiction over the dam or the land on which the dam is built should be given the opportunity to review and comment on the report prior to submission to the Governor or dam owner. The District Engineer will transmit final approved reports to the Governor of the State and the dam owner (or the Governor only, when requested in writing by State officials). If the report is initially furnished to the Governor only, a period of up to ten days may be allowed before the report is furnished to the dam owner. If the Governor or the owner indicates additional technical information is available that might affect the assessment of the dam's condition, the District Engineer will furnish the proposed final report to the Governor and the owner and establish a definite time period for comments to be furnished to the District Engineer prior to report approval.

    (iii) In general the Governor will be responsible for public release of an inspection report and for initiating any public Statements. However, an approved report must be treated as any other document subject to release upon request under the Freedom of Information Act. The letters of transmittal to the Governor and owner should indicate that under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the documents will be subject to release upon request after receipt by the Governor. Proposed final reports will be considered as internal working papers not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act. Corps personnel, A-E contractor personnel and others working under supervision of the Corps will be cautioned to avoid public statements about the condition of the dam until after the District Engineer has approved the report. The Corps will respond fully to inquiries after the Governor has received the approved report or been notified of an unsafe dam. An information copy of the report should be sent to the District office normally having jurisdiction if other than the District responsible for the inspection.

    (iv)  A Federal investment of the magnitude anticipated for this inspection program makes it desirable that a reporting system be established to keep the District Engineer abreast of the implementation of the recommendations in the inspection reports. The letters of transmittal to the Governor and owner will request that the District Engineer be informed of the actions taken on the recommendations in the inspection reports. However, the National Dam Inspection Act only authorizes the initial inspection of certain dams; therefore, once a report is completed no reinspection will be undertaken.

    (4)  The investigating engineer will be required to immediately notify the District Engineer when a dam is assessed as being unsafe. He will also indicate if probable failure of the unsafe dam is judged to be imminent and immediate action is required to reduce or eliminate the threat. The District Engineer will evaluate the findings of the investigating team and will immediately notify the Governor and the owner if the findings are Unsafe Non-Emergency or Unsafe-Emergency. The appropriate State agency and the Corps of Engineers officials having emergency operation responsibility for the area in which the dam is located will also be notified. The information provided in the unsafe dam notice shall be as indicated in Appendix F. Any emergency procedures or remedial actions deemed necessary by the District Engineer will be recommended to the Governor who has the responsibility for any corrective actions. As provided in ER 500-1-1, Corps assistance under Pub. L. 84-99 “Advance Measures,” may be made available to complement the owner's and Governor's action under certain conditions and subject to the approval of the Director of Civil Works. The District Engineer's Emergency Operation Officer will coordinate the advance measures request in accordance with existing procedures. Coordination will be maintained between the District responsible for emergency action under Pub. L. 84-90 and the District responsible for the inspection.

    (5)  An emergency action plan should be available for every dam in the high and significant hazard category. Such plans should outline actions to be taken by the operator to minimize downstream effects of an emergency and should include an effective warning system. If an emergency action plan has not been developed, the inspection report should recommend that the owner develop such an action plan. However, the Corps has no authority to require an emergency action plan.

    (k)  Progress reports should be submitted monthly by the Division Engineer to WRSC. The reports shall include progress through the last Saturday of the month and should be mailed by the following Monday. The reports shall contain the information and be typewritten in the format shown in appendix G. Copies of Unsafe Dam Data Sheets will be submitted with the progress report. Copies of the completed inspection report for Dams in the Unsafe-Emergency category will be submitted also. (RCS-DAEN-CWE-19)

    (l) —(1)  _Contracts_ for performing inventory and inspection activities under supervision of the Corps of Engineers shall be Fixed-Price Architect Engineer Contracts for Services. A sample scope of work setting forth requirements is provided in appendix H. Experience has shown that costs for individual dam inspection have been lower when multiple inspections are included in one contract. Therefore, each A-E contract should include multiple dam inspections where practicable. Corps participation in A-E inspections should be held to a minimum. Corps representatives should participate in only enough A-E inspections to assure the equality of the inspections.

    (2)  Contracts with States for performing inventory and inspection activities under State supervision may be either a Cost-Reimbursement type A-E Contract for Services or a Fixed-Price type contract. The selection of Architect-Engineers by the State should require approval of the Corps of Engineers Contracting Officer. The negotiated price for A-E services under cost-reimbursement type contracts with States will also require approval by the Contracting Officer. Contracts with States should require  submission of the inspection reports to the District Engineer for review and approval. The contract provisions should also prevent public release of or public comment on the inspection report until the District Engineer has reviewed and approved the report. Corps of Engineers participation in State inspections should be limited to occasional selected inspections to assure the quality of the State program.

    (m)  As indicated in paragraph (f) of this section, one objective of the inspection program for non-Federal Dams is to prepare the States to provide effective dam safety programs. In many States this will require training of personnel of State agencies in the technical aspects of dam inspections. The Office, Chief of Engineers is studying the need for and content of a comprehensive Corps-sponsored training program in dam inspection technology. Pending the possible adoption of such a comprehensive plan, division and district Engineers are encouraged to take advantage of suitable opportunities to provide needed training in dam safety activities to qualified employees of State agencies and, when appropriate, to employees of architect-engineer firms engaged in the program. The following general considerations should be observed in providing such training:

    (1) Priority must be placed on inspection of dams and updating the national dam inventory; hence, diversion of resources to training activities should not deter or delay these principle program functions.

    (2) Salaries, per diem and travel expenses relating to training activities of State employees will be a State expense. There will be no tuition charge for State employees.

    (3) Architect-Engineer firms will be required to pay expenses and tuition costs for their employees participating in Corps-sponsored training activities.

    (4) Corps-sponsored training will require that each trainee is a qualified engineer or geologist and will concentrate on engineering technology related directly to dam safety. (This may require screening of proposed candidates for training.)

    (5) Under this program, the Corps will not sponsor training that is intended primarily to satisfy requirements for a degree.

    (6) Training by participation in actual dam inspections and/or management of the inspection program should be encouraged.

#### § § 230.5

    The district commander is the Corps NEPA official responsible for compliance with NEPA for actions within district boundaries. The district commander also provides agency views on other agencies' environmental impact statements (EIS). The Office of Environmental Policy HQUSACE (CECW-RE) WASH DC 20314-1000 (phone number 202-272-0166) is the point of contact for information on Corps NEPA documents, NEPA oversight activities, review of other agencies' EISs and NEPA documents about legislation, regulations, national program proposals or other major policy issues. The Assistant Chief Counsel for Environmental Law and Regulatory Programs, HQUSACE (CECC-E) WASH DC 20314-1000, is the point of contact for legal questions involving environmental matters. Requests for information on regulatory permit actions should be directed to HQUSACE (CECW-OR) WASH DC 20314-1000.

    § 230.6   Actions normally requiring an EIS.

#### § § 230.6

    Actions normally requiring an EIS are:

    (a) Feasibility reports for authorization and construction of major projects;

    (b) Proposed changes in projects which increase size substantially or add additional purposes; and

    (c) Proposed major changes in the operation and/or maintenance of completed projects.

    District commanders may consider the use of an environmental assessment (EA) on these types of actions if early studies and coordination show that a particular action is not likely to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

    § 230.7   Actions normally requiring an Environmental Assessment (EA) but not necessarily an EIS.

#### § § 230.7

    Actions normally requiring an EA, but not an EIS, are listed below:

    (a)  Most permits will normally require only an EA.

    (b)  Changes which may be approved under the discretionary authority of the Secretary of the Army.

    (c)  Projects recommended for approval of the Chief of Engineers under the following authorities:

    (1) Section 205, Small Flood Control Authority;

    (2) Section 208, Snagging and Clearing for Flood Control Authority;

    (3) Section 107, Small Navigation Project Authority;

    (4) Section 103, Small Beach Erosion Control Project Authority; and

    (5) Section 111, Mitigation of Shore Damages Attributable to Navigation Projects.

    (d)  Changes in environmental impacts which were not considered in the project EIS or EA. Examples are changes in pool level operations, use of new disposal areas, location of bank protection works, etc.

    (e)  (1) Disposal of a Civil Works project or portions of project properties not reported as excess to the General Services Administration.

    (2) Disposal of real property for public port and industrial purposes.

    (3) Grants of leases or easements for other than minor oil and gas transmission lines, electric power transmission lines, road and highway rights-of-way, and sewage or water treatment facilities and land fills.

    § 230.8   Emergency actions.

#### § § 230.8

    In responding to emergency situations to prevent or reduce imminent risk of life, health, property, or severe economic losses, district commanders may proceed without the specific documentation and procedural requirements of other sections of this regulation. District commanders shall consider the probable environmental consequences in determining appropriate emergency actions and when requesting approval to proceed on emergency actions, will describe proposed NEPA documentation or reasons for exclusion from documentation. NEPA documentation should be accomplished prior to initiation of emergency work if time constraints render this practicable. Such documentation may also be accomplished after the completion of emergency work, if appropriate. Emergency actions include Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Activities pursuant to Pub. L. 84-99, as amended, and projects constructed under sections 3 of the River and Harbor Act of 1945 or 14 of the Flood Control Act of 1946 of the Continuing Authorities Program. When possible, emergency actions considered major in scope with potentially significant environmental impacts shall be referred through the division commanders to HQUSACE (CECW-RE) for consultation with CEQ about NEPA arrangements.

    § 230.9   Categorical exclusions.

#### § § 230.9

    Actions listed below when considered individually and cumulatively do not have significant effects on the quality of the human environment and are categorically excluded from NEPA documentation. However, district commanders should be alert for extraordinary circumstances which may dictate the need to prepare an EA or an EIS. Even though an EA or EIS is not indicated for a Federal action because of a “categorical exclusion”, that fact does not exempt the action from compliance with any other Federal law. For example, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., is always mandatory, even for actions not requiring an EA or EIS.

    (a) For a period of one year from the effective date of these regulations, district commanders should maintain an information list on the type and number of categorical exclusion actions which due to extraordinary circumstances triggered the need for an EA and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) or an EIS. If a district commander determines that a categorical exclusion should be modified, the information will be furnished to the division commander, who will review and analyze the actions and circumstances to determine if there is a basis for recommending a modification to the list of categorical exclusions. HQUSACE (CECW-RE) will review recommended changes for Corps-wide consistency and revise the list accordingly. See 33 CFR part 325, appendix B for categorical exclusions for regulatory actions.

    (b) Activities at completed Corps projects which carry out the authorized project purposes. Examples include routine operation and maintenance actions, general administration, equipment purchases, custodial actions, erosion control, painting, repair, rehabilitation, replacement of existing structures and facilities such as buildings, roads, levees, groins and utilities, and installation of new buildings utilities, or roadways in developed areas.

    (c) Minor maintenance dredging using existing disposal sites.

    (d) Planning and technical studies which do not contain recommendations for authorization or funding for construction, but may recommend further study. This does not exclude consideration of environmental matters in the studies.

    (e) All Operations and Maintenance grants, general plans, agreements, etc., necessary to carry out land use, development and other measures proposed in project authorization documents, project design memoranda, master plans, or reflected in the project NEPA documents.

    (f) Real estate grants for use of excess or surplus real property.

    (g) Real estate grants for Government-owned housing.

    (h) Exchanges of excess real property and interests therein for property required for project purposes.

    (i) Real estate grants for rights-of-way which involve only minor disturbances to earth, air, or water:

    (1) Minor access roads, streets and boat ramps.

    (2) Minor utility distribution and collection lines, including irrigation.

    (3) Removal of sand, gravel, rock, and other material from existing borrow areas.

    (4) Oil and gas seismic and gravity meter survey for exploration purposes.

    (j) Real estate grants of consent to use Government-owned easement areas.

    (k) Real estate grants for archeological and historical investigations compatible with the Corps Historic Preservation Act responsibilities.

    (l) Renewal and minor amendments of existing real estate grants evidencing authority to use Government-owned real property.

    (m) Reporting excess real property to the General Services Administration for disposal.

    (n) Boundary line agreements and disposal of lands or release of deed restrictions to cure encroachments.

    (o) Disposal of excess easement interest to the underlying fee owner.

    (p) Disposal of existing buildings and improvements for off-site removal.

    (q) Sale of existing cottage site areas.

    (r) Return of public domain lands to the Department of the Interior.

    (s) Transfer and grants of lands to other Federal agencies.

    § 230.10   Environmental Assessments (EA).

#### § § 230.10

    (a)  An EA is a brief document which provides sufficient information to the district commander on potential environmental effects of the proposed action and, if appropriate, its alternatives, for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI (40 CFR 1508.9). The district commander is responsible for making this determination and for keeping the public informed of the availability of the EA and FONSI.

    (b)  While no special format is required, the EA should include a brief discussion of the need for the proposed action, or appropriate alternatives if there are unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives and a list of the agencies, interested groups and the public consulted. The document is to be concise for meaningful review and decision.

    (c)  In the case of planning and/or engineering reports not requiring an EIS, the EA may be combined with or integrated into the report. The same guidance on combining or integrating an EIS within the report shall apply equally to an EA. Where the EA is combined with a Corps report or prepared as a separate document in the case of construction, operating projects and real estate actions requiring an EA, the EA normally should not exceed 15 pages.

    § 230.11   Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI).

#### § § 230.11

    A FONSI shall be prepared for a proposed action, not categorically excluded, for which an EIS will not be prepared. The FONSI will be a brief summary document as noted in 40 CFR 1508.13. In the case of feasibility, continuing authority, or special planning reports and certain planning/engineering reports, the draft FONSI and EA should be included within the draft report and circulated for a minimum 30-day review to concerned agencies, organizations and the interested public (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)). In the case of operation and maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material requiring a public notice, the notice will indicate the availability of the EA/FONSI. For all other Corps project actions a notice of availability of the FONSI will be sent to concerned agencies, organizations and the interested public (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(1)).

    § 230.12   Notice of intent and scoping.

#### § § 230.12

    As soon as practicable after a decision is made to prepare an EIS or supplement, the scoping process for the draft EIS or supplement will be announced in a notice of intent. Guidance on preparing a notice of intent to prepare an EIS for publication in the  is discussed in Appendix C. Also, a public notice will be widely distributed inviting public participation in the scoping process. As described in 40 CFR 1501.7 and reference 3(m), this process is the key to preparing a concise EIS and clarifying the significant issues to be analyzed in depth. Public concerns on issues, studies needed, alternatives to be examined, procedures and other related matters will be addressed during scoping.

    § 230.13   Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

#### § § 230.13

    An EIS for feasibility or continuing authority reports and certain planning/engineering reports may be combined with or integrated into the report in accordance with 40 CFR 1500.4(o) and 1506.4. An EIS combined with the report shall follow the format in 40 CFR 1502.10, follow the main report, use colored paper and not be an attachment or appendix. An EIS integrated within the report may follow the instructions in the last paragraph of 40 CFR 1502.10. Additional guidance on combining and integrating EISs is located in ER 1105-2-60. Where the EIS is not combined with or integrated into the project document, the EIS shall be a separate document and follow the format in 40 CFR 1502.10. CEQ regulations suggest maximum lengths for the text of an EIS at 40 CFR 1502.07. An effort should be exerted to cover the substantive topics simply and concisely to the extent practicable, and consistent with producing a legally and technically adequate EIS. Normally, the CEQ page limits should be met.

    (a)  Guidance on EISs prepared for planning and certain planning/engineering studies is contained in ER 1105-2-10 thru 60. 33 CFR part 325, appendix B contains guidance for regulatory actions. For final EISs which are not combined with or integrated into the report, the final EIS may take the form of an “abbreviated” document described in 40 CFR 1503.4(c). An abbreviated final EIS should consist of a new title page, summary, errata or correction sheet(s) and comments and responses. In filing the abbreviated final EIS with EPA (Washington Office), five copies of the draft EIS shall be included in the transmittal. District commanders shall be responsible for determining the type of final EIS to prepare.

    (b)  A supplement to the _draft_ or final EIS should be prepared whenever required as discussed in 40 CFR 1502.09(c). A supplement to a draft EIS should be prepared and filed in the same manner as a draft EIS and should be titled “Supplement I”, “Supplement II”, etc. The final EIS should address the changes noted in the supplement and substantive comments received as a result of circulation of the document. A supplement to a final EIS should be prepared and filed first as a  supplement and then as a final supplement. Supplements will be filed and circulated in the same manner as a draft and final EIS (including the abbreviated procedure discussed in 13a. above). Supplements to a draft or final EIS filed before 30 July 1979 may follow the format of the previously filed EIS. Supplements to a draft EIS filed after this date will follow the format outlined in 40 CFR 1502.10. References to the draft or final EIS being supplemented should be used to eliminate repetitive discussions in order to focus on the important issues and impacts. The transmittal letter to EPA as well as the cover sheet should clearly identify the title and purpose of the document as well as the title and filing date of the previous EIS being supplemented and how copies can be obtained. The decision may be made on the proposed action by the appropriate Corps official no sooner than 30 days after the final supplement has been on file. A record of decision will be signed when the decision is made.

    (c)  Tiering is discussed in 40 CFR 1502.20 and 1508.28 and should be used in appropriate cases. The initial broad or programmatic EIS must present sufficient information regarding overall impacts of the proposed action so that the decision-makers can make a reasoned judgment on the merits of the action at the present stage of planning or development and exclude from consideration issues already decided or not ready for decision. The initial broad EIS should also identify data gaps and discuss future plans to supplement the data and prepare and circulate site specific EISs or EAs as appropriate.

    (d)  District commanders may also publish periodic fact sheets and/or other supplemental information documents on long-term or complex EISs to keep the public informed on the status of the proposed action. These documents will not be filed officially with EPA.

    § 230.14   Record of decision and implementation.

#### § § 230.14

    A record of decision shall be prepared by the district commander, in accordance with 40 CFR 1505.2, for the signature of the final decisionmaker as prescribed by applicable Corps regulations. Procedures implementing the decision are discussed in 40 CFR 1505.3. Incoming letters of comment on the final EIS will be furnished for review by the decisionmaker who signs the record of decision. For example, the record of decision for feasibility reports will be signed by the ASA(CW) at the time the report is transmitted to Congress for authorization.

    § 230.15   Mitigation and monitoring.

#### § § 230.15

    See 40 CFR 1505.2(c) and 1505.3. District commanders shall, upon request from interested agencies or the public, provide reports on the progress and status of required mitigation and other provisions of their decisions on Corps projects. The term monitoring will be interpreted as that oversight activity necessary to ensure that the decision, including required mitigation measures, is implemented.

    § 230.16   Lead and cooperating agencies.

#### § § 230.16

    Lead agency, joint lead agency, and cooperating agency designation and responsibilities are covered in 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. The district commander is authorized to enter into agreements with regional offices of other agencies as required by 40 CFR 1501.5(c). District or division commanders will consult with HQUSACE (CECW-RE), WASH DC 20314-1000 prior to requesting resolution by CEQ as outlined by 40 CFR 1501.5 (e) and (f).

    (a)  The Corps will normally be lead agency for Corps civil works projects and will normally avoid joint lead agency arrangements. Lead agency status for regulatory actions will be determined on the basis of 40 CFR 1501.5(c).

    (b)  For cooperating agency designation the Corps area of expertise or jurisdiction by law is generally flood control, navigation, hydropower and Corps regulatory responsibilities. See Appendix II of CEQ regulations (49 FR 49750, December 21, 1984).

    § 230.17   Filing requirements.

#### § § 230.17

    Five copies of draft, final and supplement EISs should be sent to: Director, Office of Federal Activities (A-104), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. District commanders should file draft EISs and draft supplements directly with EPA. Final EISs and final supplements should be filed by appropriate elements within HQUSACE for feasibility and reevaluation reports requiring Congressional authorization. Division commanders should file final EISs and final supplements for all other Corps actions except for final EISs or final supplements for permit actions which should be filed by the district commander after appropriate reviews by division and the incorporation of division's comments in the EIS. HQUSACE and/or division will notify field office counterparts when to circulate the final EIS or final supplement and will file the final document with EPA after notified that distribution of the document has been accomplished.

    (a)  Specific timing requirements regarding the filing of EISs with EPA are discussed in 40 CFR 1506.10. District commanders will forward any expedited filing requests with appropriate supporting information through channels to CECW-RE. Once a decision is reached to prepare an EIS or supplement, district commanders will establish a time schedule for each step of the process based upon considerations listed in 40 CFR 1501.8 and upon other management considerations. The time required from the decision to prepare an EIS to filing the final EIS normally should not exceed one year (46 FR 18037, March 23, 1981). For feasibility, continuing authority, or reevaluation studies, where the project's study time is expected to exceed 12 months, the timing of the EIS should be commensurate with the study time. In appropriate circumstances where the costs of completing studies or acquiring information for an EIS (, cost in terms of money, time, or other resources) would be exorbitant, the district commander should consider using the mechanism described in 40 CFR 1502.22, as amended. In all cases, however, it is the district commander's responsibility to assure that the time-limit established for the preparation of an EIS or supplement is consistent with the purposes of NEPA.

    (b)  Minimum review periods will be observed for draft and final supplements covering actions not having a bearing on the overall project for which a final EIS has been filed. Such supplements should not curtail other ongoing or scheduled actions on the overall project which have already complied with the procedural requirements of NEPA.

    § 230.18   Availability.

#### § § 230.18

    Draft and final EISs and supplements will be available to the public as provided in 40 CFR 1502.19 and 1506.6. A summary may be circulated in lieu of the EIS, as provided in 40 CFR 1502.19, if the statement is unusually long. These documents will normally be made available without charge except that, in unusual circumstances, reproduction costs may be recovered in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6(f) from recipients other than those required by CEQ to receive the complete EIS.

    § 230.19   Comments.

#### § § 230.19

    District commanders shall request comments as set forth in 40 CFR 1503 and 1506.6. A lack of response may be presumed to indicate that the party has no comment to make.

    (a)  District commanders will consider and act on requests for time extensions to review and comment on an EIS based on timeliness of distribution of the document, prior agency involvement in the proposed action, and the action's scope and complexity.

    (b)  See 40 CFR 1506.6(c). Refer to paragraph 12, 33 CFR part 325, appendix B for regulatory actions.

    (c)  See 40 CFR 1503.4. District commanders will pay particular attention to the display in the final EIS of comments received on the draft EIS. In the case of abbreviated final EISs, follow 40 CFR 1503.4(c). For all other final EISs, comments and agency responses thereto will be placed in an appendix in a format most efficient for users of the final EIS to understand the nature of public input and the district commander's consideration thereof. District commanders will avoid lengthy or repetitive verbatim reporting of comments and will keep responses clear and concise.

    (d)  Responses to comments received on the final EIS are required only when substantive issues are raised which have not been addressed in the EIS. In the case of feasibility reports where the final report and EIS, Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors (CEBRH) or Mississippi River Commission (CEMRC) report, and the proposed Chief's report are circulated for review, incoming comment letters will normally be answered, if appropriate, by CECW-P. After the review period is over, CECW-P will provide copies of all incoming comments received in HQUSACE to the district commander for use in preparing the draft record of decision. For all other Corps actions except regulatory actions (See 33 CFR part 325, appendix B), two copies of all incoming comment letters (even if the letters do not require an agency response) together with the district commander's responses (if appropriate) and the draft record of decision will be submitted through channels to the appropriate decision authority. In the case of a letter recommending a referral under 40 FR part 1504, reporting officers will notify CECW-RE and request further guidance. The record of decision will not be signed nor any action taken on the proposal until the referral case is resolved.

    (e)  See 40 CFR 1503.2 and 1503.3. District commanders will provide comments directly to the requesting agency. CECW-RE will provide comments about legislation, national program proposals, regulations or other major policy issues to the requesting agency. See appendix III of CEQ regulations. When the Corps is a cooperating agency, the Corps will provide comments on another Federal agency's draft EIS even if the response is no comment. Comments should be specific and restricted to areas of Corps jurisdiction by law and special expertise as defined in 40 CFR 1508.15 and 1508.26, generally including flood control, navigation, hydropower, and regulatory responsibilities. See appendix II of CEQ regulations.

    § 230.20   Integration with State and local procedures.

#### § § 230.20

    See 40 CFR 1506.2.

    § 230.21   Adoption.

#### § § 230.21

    See 40 CFR 1506.3. A district commander will normally adopt another Federal agency's EIS and consider it to be adequate unless the district commander finds substantial doubt as to technical or procedural adequacy or omission of factors important to the Corps decision. In such cases, the district commander will prepare a draft and final supplement noting in the draft supplement why the EIS was considered inadequate. In all cases, except where the document is not recirculated as provided in 40 CFR 1506.3 (b) or (c), the adopted EIS with the supplement, if any, will be processed in accordance with this regulation. A district commander may also adopt another agency's EA/FONSI.

    § 230.22   Limitations on actions during the NEPA process.

#### § § 230.22

    See 40 CFR 1506.1.

    § 230.23   Predecision referrals.

#### § § 230.23

    See 40 CFR part 1504. If the district commander determines that a predecision referral is appropriate, the case will be sent through division to reach CECW-RE not later than 15 days after the final EIS was filed with EPA. Corps actions referred to CEQ by another Federal agency shall be transmitted to CECW-RE for further guidance. See paragraph 19, 33 CFR part 325, appendix B, for guidance on predecision referrals affecting regulatory permit actions.

    § 230.24   Agency decision points.

#### § § 230.24

    The timing and processing of NEPA documents in relation to major decision points are addressed in paragraphs 11 and 14 and appendix A for studies and projects and 33 CFR part 320 through 330 for regulatory actions.

    § 230.25   Environmental review and consultation requirements.

#### § § 230.25

    See 40 CFR 1502.25.

    (a) For Federal projects, NEPA documents shall be prepared concurrently with and utilize data from analyses required by other environmental laws and executive orders. A listing of environmental laws and orders is contained in table 3.4.3 of Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies. Reviews and consultation requirements, analyses, and status of coordination associated with applicable laws, executive orders and memoranda will be summarized in the draft document. The results of the coordination completed or underway pursuant to these authorities will be summarized in the final document. Where the results of the ongoing studies are not expected to materially affect the decision on the proposed action, the filing of the final EIS need not be delayed.

    (b)  For general policy guidance, see  of April 12, 1979, 32 CFR part 197. Procedural requirements for Civil Works studies and projects are discussed below.

    (1) The district commander through the division commander will notify CECW-PE, PN, PS or PW as appropriate, of an impending action which may impact on another country and for which environmental studies may be necessary to determine the extent and significance of the impact. The district commander will inform CECW-P whether entry into the country is necessary to study the base condition.

    (2) CECW-P will notify the State Department, Office of Environment and Health (OES/ENH) of the district commander's concern, and whether a need exists at this point to notify officially the foreign nation of our intent to study potential impacts. Depending on expected extent and severity of impacts, or if entry is deemed necessary, the matter will be referred to the appropriate foreign desk for action.

    (3) As soon as it becomes evident that the impacts of the proposed actions are considered significant, CECW-P will notify the State Department. The State Department will determine whether the foreign embassy needs to be notified, and will do so if deemed appropriate, requesting formal discussions on the matter. When the International Joint Commission (IJC) or the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (IBWC) is involved in a study, the State Department should be consulted to determine the foreign policy implications of any action and the proper course of action for formal consultations.

    (4) Prior to public dissemination, press releases or reports dealing with impact assessments in foreign nations should be made available to the appropriate foreign desk at the State Department for clearance and coordination with the foreign embassy.

    § 230.26   General considerations in preparing Corps EISs.

#### § § 230.26

    (a)  See (40 CFR 1502.6).

    (b)  To the maximum extent practicable, the EIS should incorporate material by reference in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21. Footnotes should be used only where their use greatly aids the reader's understanding of the point discussed. Citation in the EIS of material incorporated by reference should be made by indicating an author's last name and date of the reference in parentheses at the appropriate location in the EIS. The list of references will be placed at the end of the EIS. Only information sources actually cited in the text should appear in the reference list. The reference list should include the author's name, the date and title of the publication, personal communications and type of communication (e.g., letter, telephone, interview, etc.).

  PART 234—CORPS OF ENGINEERS AGENCY SPECIFIC PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLES, REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES FOR FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN WATER RESOURCES

### Part 234

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1962-3.

**Source:** Source: 89 FR 104021, Dec. 19, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

    § 234.1   General.

#### § § 234.1

    (a) This part prescribes the Agency Specific Procedures (ASPs) for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to execute its Civil Works mission, in accordance with the Water Resources Principles and Guidelines defined in section 2031 of the Water Resources and Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-114; 42 U.S.C. 1962-3), the Principles, Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) issued by the Council on Environmental Quality and approved by the Water Resources Council, and as called for in section 110 of WRDA 2020 (Division AA of Pub. L. 116-260).

    (b) Section 2031 of the WRDA of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-114) directed the Secretary of the Army to revise the March 10, 1983, Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies (P&G) for Corps use and to address the following considerations: advancements in economic and analytic techniques; public safety; low-income communities; nonstructural approaches; interaction with other water resources projects and programs; integrated and adaptive management; and use of public benefits to justify projects. This WRDA provision also provided that the Federal Objective is to reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment by seeking to maximize sustainable economic development, avoid the unwise use of floodplains, and protect and restore natural ecosystems.

    (c) The PR&G was issued as an interagency effort to modernize the P&G. The PR&G is comprised of the Principles and Requirements (P&R) issued in March 2013 and the Interagency Guidelines issued in December 2014. The PR&G emphasizes that water resources projects should strive to meet the Federal Objective and maximize public benefits relative to public costs. The PR&G is designed to support water infrastructure projects with the greatest public benefits (economic, environmental, and social benefits) relative to costs.

    (d) Congress directed the Secretary of the Army to issue ASPs to implement the PR&G in section 110 of WRDA 2020 (Division AA of Pub. L. 116-260).

    § 234.2   Definitions.

#### § § 234.2

    The viability and appropriateness of an alternative from the perspective of the Nation's general public and consistency with existing Federal laws, authorities, and public policies. It does not include local or regional preferences for solutions or political expediency.

    A deliberate, iterative, and scientific-based process of designing, implementing, monitoring, and adjusting an action, measure, or project to address changing circumstances and outcomes, reduce uncertainty, and maximize one or more goals over time.

    The extent to which an alternative provides and accounts for all features, investments, and/or other actions necessary to realize the planned effects, including any necessary actions by others. It does not necessarily mean that alternative actions need to be large in scope or scale.

    The extent to which an alternative alleviates the specified problems and achieves the specified opportunities.

    The extent to which an alternative alleviates the specified problems and realizes the specified opportunities at the least cost.

    Investments made by the Corps related to water resources development projects, including flood and storm risk management, ecosystem restoration, land management activities, navigation, recreation, and hydropower.

    The fundamental goal of Federal investments in water resources. Federal water resources investments shall reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment. Federal investments should strive to maximize net public benefits.

    Indigenous Knowledge may be described as a body of observations, oral and written knowledge, innovations, practices, and beliefs developed by Tribes and Indigenous Peoples through interaction and experience with the environment, consistent with the definitions used in 43 CFR 2361.5 and 6101.4(h) and the Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Indigenous Knowledge, issued November 30, 2022. It is applied to phenomena across biological, physical, social, cultural, and spiritual systems. Indigenous Knowledge can be developed over millennia, continues to develop, and includes understanding based on evidence acquired through direct contact with the environment and long-term experiences, as well as extensive observations, lessons, and skills passed from generation to generation.

    An alternative comprised of actions to protect, sustainably manage, or restore natural or modified ecosystems to address societal challenges, while simultaneously providing benefits for people and the environment.

    (1) A legally constituted public body (including an Indian Tribe and a Tribal Organization (as those terms are defined in 25 U.S.C. 5304)); or

    (2) A nonprofit entity with the consent of the affected local government, that has full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement and to pay damages, if necessary, in the event of failure to perform.

    An alternative comprised of a nonstructural approach or combination of nonstructural approaches that addresses the water resources problem.

    An approach that alters the use of existing infrastructure or human activities to generally avoid or minimize adverse changes to existing hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes. This may include measures such as certain forms of nature-based solutions; modified floodplain practices; policy modifications; vessel speed limits; traffic management and tidal navigation restrictions; the reoperation of dams and reservoirs to restore or better mimic natural hydrology and flow patterns; invasive plant removal; signage to limit public access at an aquatic ecosystem restoration site; setbacks; elevations; relocation; buyout/acquisition including the acquisition of flowage easements; dry flood proofing; and wet flood proofing. They may also include actions that are not the responsibility of the Corps such as providing flood insurance, establishing building codes for new construction, and other local floodplain management practices, installing early warning systems, and developing emergency evacuation plans.

    An evidence-based decision that relies on appropriate training and experience.

    Encompasses economic, environmental, and social impacts, and includes those that can be quantified in monetary terms, as well as those that can be quantified or described qualitatively.

    The changes in the distribution of regional economic activity that would result from implementation of an alternative plan. These economic effects amount to a transfer of resources from one part of the Nation to another (either from one region of the country to another, or within a region). They accrue in a local area or region but are offset by equivalent losses elsewhere in the country.

    Generally, those activities subject to legal restrictions promulgated by the Federal Government.

    Resilience is the ability to prepare for threats and hazards, adapt to changing conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from adverse conditions and disruptions.

    The creation and maintenance of conditions under which humans and nature can coexist in the present and into the future.

    An Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian Tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 5130.

    Any action or change that diminishes public health and safety, or an action that is incompatible with or adversely impacts one or more floodplain functions that leads to a floodplain that is no longer self-sustaining or degrades ecosystem services.

    A land area that drains to a common waterbody.

    § 234.3   Exceptions.

#### § § 234.3

    Exceptions to any requirements or policy contained in this part may be requested by the Corps or the non-Federal interest or responsible Tribal, State, or local government. Exceptions must be requested in writing and will be reviewed for a decision by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.

    § 234.4   Objectives and applicability.

#### § § 234.4

    (a)  The goal of the Department of the Army's ASPs is to ensure that Army Civil Works consistently applies a common framework for analyzing a diverse range of water resources development projects, programs, activities, and related actions involving Federal investments. The ASPs will advance transparency and consistency of the Corps' Federal investments in water resources. The intention of the ASPs is to outline the steps to apply the PR&G to Corps water resources investments, including a determination of the applicability of the PR&G in the context of the Corps' missions and authorities, to provide a common framework for evaluation of investment alternatives, and to ensure that the Corps adequately addresses the Guiding Principles identified in the P&R.

    (b)  Section 2031 of WRDA 2007 (Pub. L. 110-114; 42 U.S.C. 1962-3) specifies that Federal water resources investments shall reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment. The Corps shall accomplish this Federal Objective of water resources planning policy by:

    (1) Seeking to maximize sustainable economic development;

    (2) Seeking to avoid the unwise use of floodplains and flood-prone areas and minimizing adverse impacts and vulnerabilities in any case in which a floodplain or flood-prone area must be used; and

    (3) Protecting and restoring the functions of natural systems and mitigating any unavoidable damage to natural systems.

    (c)  The Corps shall strive to maximize net public benefits to society. Public benefits encompass economic, environmental, and social goals, include monetized and un-monetized effects, and allow for the consideration of both quantified and unquantified effects.

    (d)  (1) The objectives in paragraph (b) of this section shall be embodied in all new Army Civil Works' water resources investments, which include both structural and nonstructural approaches to water resources problems. The PR&G analysis under the Corps' ASPs described in this part is generally required for feasibility studies; general re-evaluation reports; major rehabilitation reports; studies performed under the continuing authorities program of the Corps; studies to support significant changes to project operations including any such changes that warrant preparation of an environmental impact statement, re-allocation studies, and studies conducted under section 216 of the Flood Control Act of 1970 (33 U.S.C. 549a); and any other project or program not otherwise excluded under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

    (2) The PR&G is not intended to apply to all Federal actions. The following types of Federal investments are identified as excluded from the requirements of this part:

    (i) Regulatory actions, such as the issuance of permits associated with section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344).

    (ii) Real estate actions.

    (iii) Planning Assistance to States program.

    (iv) Flood Plain Management Services program.

    (v) Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 408) program.

    (vi) Public Law 84-99 program.

    (vii) Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program.

    (viii) Environmental Infrastructure projects.

    (ix) Land management plans.

    (x) Operation and maintenance activities that are carried out in a manner consistent with the existing approved operation and maintenance manual or plan for an authorized project. This exclusion does not apply to significant proposed changes to an existing O&M plan including proposals that may be controversial, significant changes to the existing plan to meet new goals, and other significant changes that may warrant a further analysis of the options for operation and maintenance.

    (xi) International and Interagency Services and Support for Others actions.

    (xii) Research or monitoring activities.

    (xiii) Emergency actions.

    (xiv) Projects, programs, or plans that fall below the thresholds identified in table 1 to § 234.5(c). These excluded actions generally occur when investments are routine and have inconsequential effects on water resources.

    (xv) Additional programs, plans, or projects which the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works determines do not require analysis pursuant to § 234.3.

    § 234.5   Level of analysis.

#### § § 234.5

    (a)  Once a determination has been made that the PR&G does apply, the level of analysis shall be determined. The level of PR&G analysis required will vary in scope and magnitude across programs and activities. There are two levels of analysis: standard and scaled. In general, the level of analysis should be commensurate with the significance of the Federal investment in terms of dollar value and the potential environmental impacts. While there is not a clear distinction between the different levels of analysis, the two types of analysis can generally be distinguished in several ways:

    (1) A standard analysis seeks to evaluate all the relevant benefits and costs associated with the project or activity using original or secondary data. This type of analysis is typically used for new or significantly modified actions. The Corps would conduct a benefit-cost analysis of programs and activities that have some effect on the environment. For projects/activities that fall into the category of standard analysis, the analysis should make significantly greater efforts to quantify and monetize impacts. The extent to which effects can and should be monetized should be made on a resource-by-resource basis and should consider the estimated present value cost of the project/activity and the significance of the effects.

    (2) A scaled analysis is an analysis that is more limited in scope for projects, programs, or plans that have low risk/low cost, have minimal consequences of failure, pose minimal threats to human life or safety, or do not result in significant impacts to the environment. A scaled analysis may rely on benefits function transfer methods and readily available secondary data sources. Benefits function transfer methods are used to estimate monetary values by transferring available information about relationships from studies already completed to another location, context, or issue. Best practices would be applied when using this approach to avoid common pitfalls.

    (b)  In many cases, professional judgment and available resources will be important factors in determining the appropriate level of analysis. The Corps will ensure that cumulative effects of many small, routine actions would not in itself elevate those investments to a scaled or standard analysis. Many of those small, routine actions would be excluded from PR&G analysis.

    (c)  The threshold criteria for project, programmatic, and individual plan level analysis for Army Civil Works is shown in table 1 to this paragraph (c). These thresholds represent guidelines for the level of analysis that is likely to be most appropriate for an activity, given the level of investment in, appropriations for, or cost of that activity. In determining whether a given activity or project falls under or exceeds the financial thresholds, it is the level of the present value of Federal investment that is the relevant criterion to use. However, for a particular activity, a different level of analysis may be more appropriate, and projects/programs may depart from these guidelines where such a departure is justified. In general, a scoping effort should be undertaken to evaluate the level of effort needed to analyze the full range of potential effects. Project-level analysis should generally be used for water resources investments when the Corps has discretion in site-specific investment decisions. A programmatic-level analysis generally has a broader scale and/or scope than a project-level analysis. Programmatic-level analysis generally relates to funding programs or where a proposal for a set of similar actions analyzed under one decision document may occur.

    § 234.6   The planning process.

#### § § 234.6

    (a)  The following planning process will be used to implement the common framework summarized in the Interagency Guidelines for analyzing Federal investments in applicable water resources. The planning process will ensure that plan formulation, evaluation, and recommendations for proposed Corps investments reflect the Guiding Principles identified in the P&R: healthy and resilient ecosystems, sustainable economic development, floodplains, public safety, environmental justice, and a watershed approach. The planning process consists of a series of steps that identify or respond to problems and opportunities, as well as specific Tribal, State, and local concerns, and, in most cases, culminates in a recommended plan. The process involves an orderly and systematic approach to making determinations and decisions at each step so that the interested public and decision-makers in the planning organization can be fully aware of the following: the basic assumptions employed; the data and information analyzed; the areas of risk and uncertainty; the reasons and rationales used; and the significant implications of each alternative. The Corps will identify impacts to Tribal treaty and water rights at the earliest phases and throughout the plan evaluation process, screening alternatives that impact Tribal treaty and water rights. The planning process is iterative to adapt to new information and understanding. The result of the planning process is investment advice. The advice may be a recommended plan or plans that seek to maximize net public benefits in addressing the identified water resources problem and a description of the analysis of the benefits and costs of that and other potential plans.

    (b)  Where Federal investments in water resources require analysis under NEPA and this part, Army Civil Works should integrate, to the extent possible, the analysis in this part into existing planning processes, and may integrate this part and NEPA analyses in a single analytical document that reflects both processes. Army Civil Works shall seek opportunities to integrate other required Federal and State environmental reviews with their combined analyses.

    (c)  The Guiding Principles provide the overarching concepts that the Corps seeks to promote through investments in water resources.

    (1)  Environmental justice refers to the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people:

    (i) Are fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers; and

    (ii) Have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices. Environmental justice shall be considered throughout the Civil Works program and in all phases of project planning and decision-making. Army Civil Works projects and programs shall advance equity by meeting the needs of communities, such as by reducing disparate environmental burdens, protecting Tribal treaty rights, removing barriers to participation in decision-making, and increasing access to benefits provided by Civil Works programs, including for disadvantaged communities. The planning process shall put these communities at the front and center of studies, providing robust opportunities for effective participation in the planning and decision-making processes. Any disproportionate adverse public safety, human health, or environmental burdens of project alternatives on communities with environmental justice concerns shall be avoided, minimized, or mitigated to the greatest extent reasonable. The Corps shall ensure that communities with environmental justice concerns have meaningful opportunities to identify potential alternatives, effects, and mitigation measures. The Corps shall also be transparent in fully displaying, disclosing and considering the potential effects of alternative actions on communities with environmental justice concerns.

    (2)  All future Federal investments in and affecting floodplains must meet some level of floodplain resilience. Alternatives affecting floodplains should aim to improve floodplain resilience if possible and also should avoid the unwise use of floodplains. To identify floodplain areas for the purpose of this section, the Corps will use the best-available and actionable science including a climate-informed science approach. If construction in the floodplain or adverse impacts to a floodplain's natural and beneficial functions cannot be avoided, then the alternative must minimize adverse impacts to these areas and mitigate unavoidable impacts using nature-based approaches where possible. The Corps shall identify and communicate potential adverse effects on floodplain functions for the various alternatives under consideration. Where the Corps proposes to construct a project feature in a floodplain because that is the best way to achieve flood risk reduction or other public purposes, that proposed Corps project is not automatically considered an unwise use of the floodplain. The Corps shall strive to sustain the floodplain's natural and beneficial functions to the maximum extent practicable given the project's purpose and need.

    (3)  Alternatives shall protect the existing functions of ecosystems and may restore the health of damaged ecosystems to a less degraded and more natural state where feasible and in accordance with current study and cost-sharing authorities. When adverse environmental impacts cannot be completely avoided, alternatives shall strive to minimize environmental impacts. When a particular alternative will cause unavoidable damage to the environment, mitigation to offset damages shall be incorporated into that alternative and evaluated as part of that alternative. In developing alternatives, consideration shall be given to ecosystem resilience, including acknowledging the value of ecosystem services to people. When evaluating alternatives, the health of the affected ecosystem shall be measured in its current condition as the baseline and projected under the alternatives being considered, including the No Action alternative.

    (4)  Alternative solutions shall strive to avoid, reduce, or mitigate significant risks to public safety, including both loss of life and injury, and shall include measures to manage and communicate the residual risks. The impact and reliability of alternatives on significant risks to public safety must be evaluated for both existing and future conditions, considered in decision-making, and documented.

    (5)  The Corps' investments in water resources shall encourage sustainable economic development. This is accomplished through the sustainable use and management of water resources, ensuring overall water resources resilience. Sustainable economic development creates and maintains conditions under which humans and nature can coexist. Analysis under sustainable economic development shall present, where feasible, information about the environmental resources in the project area or the area where activities are occurring, and how the resources and their value might be expected to change over time. Physical capital information may also be included where relevant. Analysis shall also include information on socio-economic conditions under current and projected conditions. Economic, social, and environmental effects and benefits shall be incorporated into the analysis of alternatives.

    (6)  When developing alternatives, the water resources problem being addressed should be analyzed on a watershed-based level to facilitate inclusion of a complete range of solutions, after considering the breadth of impacts across the watershed. A key aspect of the watershed approach is the analysis of information regarding watershed conditions and needs, allowing for consideration of upstream and downstream conditions and needs; consideration of other projects and actions in place, underway or planned by other agencies within the watershed; and the more thorough addressing of the potential impacts of a proposed action. The scale of the watershed used to develop alternatives can vary. The appropriately sized watershed for the particular need being addressed shall be a case-specific determination based on the relevant facts and circumstances. The watershed scale used to develop alternatives should encompass a geographical area large enough to ensure plans address cause and effect relationships among affected resources and activities, both upstream and downstream, and cumulative in nature, that are important to gaining public benefits or avoiding harm from the project. The watershed approach ensures that the interconnectedness of systems is evaluated to fully understand the root causes and symptoms of the water resources problem and the full range of potential public benefits. Communication starting in the scoping phase with other agencies or Tribal, territorial, State, and local government partners working in the watershed will help realize a watershed approach. In addition, other potential investments in the watershed shall also be accounted for under the watershed approach.

    (d)  (1) The planning process will seek to achieve full collaboration with a wide range of affected Tribes, governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, communities with environmental justice concerns, and the public in all stages of the planning process. Collaboration with Tribes, governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, communities with environmental justice concerns, and the general public throughout the planning process allows consideration of multiple perspectives and information sources, such as Indigenous Knowledge, and shall be emphasized throughout the planning process. Collaboration with Tribes, communities, and local and State governments is a critical element to help identify specific problems, opportunities, and significant constraints within the study area, and to help establish planning goals and objectives that are consistent with the objectives of this part and are locally appropriate. Starting at the earliest phase in the planning process, Tribes and other communities with environmental justice concerns shall have an opportunity to play a key role in identifying alternatives, enhancing the positive benefits to their communities from potential Federal investment, and describing any concerns they may have with a potential project. Such early, meaningful, and robust engagement will help identify and address problems, possible solutions, and scope studies. Robust, early collaboration with Tribes does not negate the need for Tribal consultation. Robust, early collaboration with Tribes is in addition to the requirement to conduct early, meaningful, and robust Government-to-Government consultation with Tribal Nations when appropriate.

    (2) To improve Federal decision-making and to promote transparency, Army Civil Works shall seek to meaningfully collaborate with other Federal and non-Federal entities. Engagement methods and scope of engagement will depend on the stage of the planning process, the issues, and the groups that will be contributing ideas and information to the planning process, and shall use best practices and techniques for engagement. Engagement strategies shall consider Corps, Tribal, and community resource constraints. Indigenous Knowledge, information from Tribal Nations, local and State governments, non-governmental organizations, and the public shall be incorporated into the problem definition and forecasting of future conditions as well as the development and analysis of alternatives. Robust engagement and transparency throughout the planning process, including during the evaluation and comparison of alternatives, will help deliver sound investment advice for water resources solutions that maximize net public benefits.

    (e)  Investigations, data collection, and analysis should be ongoing and integrated early in the planning process. Investigations should be relevant to the planning objectives and constraints. The interdisciplinary study team should identify the most important areas to focus on in the study, such as: engineering and design; surface water and groundwater hydrology; hydraulics; geology; operations; water quality; land resources; power generation and conservation; economics; financing; environmental, social, and cultural impacts and mitigation; opportunities for recreation; cost estimation for construction, operation, maintenance, replacement, and energy consumption; and climate change (to include greenhouse gas emissions). Investigation, data collection, and analysis should leverage and incorporate information from Tribal, State, local, non-governmental sources, and the public. Additional investigations should be performed as necessary.

    (f)  To identify purpose, problems, needs, and opportunities, the Corps shall:

    (1) Ensure that the planning goals and objectives are consistent with the study authority.

    (2) Clearly identify the purpose of the study, the role of the Federal Government, as well as the views of the non-Federal interest (if any), cooperating agencies, Tribes, various stakeholders, and the public.

    (3) Describe the problems and opportunities to which the agency is responding in a manner that will not foreclose consideration of the full range of reasonable alternatives, including options that the non-Federal sponsor may not support.

    (4) Define the study area, including activities within the watershed that are relevant to the proposed project and areas where impacts should be avoided.

    (5) Describe the plans for stakeholder involvement.

    (6) Prepare a summary of the planning objectives and constraints to be used in the analysis of the Federal investment. This summary should include a discussion of stakeholder, partner, and public input.

    (7) Include a discussion of the social and cultural context of the region and resources.

    (g)  A summary of the specific economic, environmental, and social setting within the study area shall cover the condition and functional relationships of affected resources; their development potential and possible conflicts in producing affected ecosystem services; and the local situation with respect to investment, climate, markets, affected communities, and basic economic productivity.

    (1) The phrase “forecast future conditions” generally relates to the identification of impacts associated with the alternatives, including the No Action alternative. Future conditions should be assessed and analyzed as part of the evaluation process, and the best available data and forecast should be used to complete an analysis of these uncertain conditions.

    (2) This exercise of identifying existing resources and forecasting future conditions will quantify, to the extent practicable, relevant water and related resource conditions as they currently exist within the study area, and forecast future conditions over the period of analysis. This would also include resources and conditions regarding the economic, environmental, and social aspects within the study area, as well as ecosystem services and climate-related scenarios. The existing resources and future conditions will be established using generally accepted sources that are national, State, or regional in scope, such as from peer-reviewed sources or sources which are government-produced.

    (3) The “without-project condition” is the most likely condition expected to exist in the future over the period of analysis in the absence of a Federal investment by the Corps (through the proposed Corps project, action, or program that is under consideration), given current laws, policies, projects under construction, and any existing resources/conditions. It considers expected actions that may be executed by others, including potential future land use conditions, and shall consider effects of climate change using multiple scenario analyses.

    (4) The “with-project condition” is the most likely condition expected to exist in the future, over the period of analysis, with a specific Corps project or program in place. It considers expected actions that may be executed by others, including potential future land use conditions, and shall consider effects of climate change using multiple scenario analyses.

    (5) To ensure that the appropriate criteria and problems are incorporated into the analytical framework, a summary of the process used to define the relevant existing conditions and foreseeable future conditions shall be prepared and made available to the public and shared with stakeholders.

    (h)  The primary goal of an alternative is to address a water resources challenge, consistent with the Federal Objective and Guiding Principles. The primary function of an alternative must be to alleviate unsatisfactory conditions or address a problem or opportunity that exists or will exist in the future without the proposed Federal investment that is under consideration. Alternatives should address the defined water resources challenge that is the subject of the analysis, and may achieve multiple purposes. Alternative formulations should focus on solutions that are feasible and meet the planning objectives of the study, based on the most likely future conditions expected with and without implementation of an alternative. The viability of an alternative should be determined through an evaluation of its acceptability, efficiency, effectiveness, and completeness, as required in the PR&G. The period of analysis should be the same for each alternative and sufficient to encompass the lifespan and significant long-term impacts of the project. In addition, alternatives may also include actions which are beyond the missions of the Corps where others may help provide solutions to the identified problem and meet the goals of the PR&G. However, such alternatives shall identify the relevant parties with requisite responsibility for those actions beyond Corps missions (such as other Federal agencies and non-Federal partners), their authority for that action, the interrelation between that action and the recommended Corps project, action, or program and appropriate sequencing of implementation. For Corps investments, the Corps will be the designated lead for completing PR&G analysis.

    (1) Alternatives are to be developed in a systematic manner that ensures that the Corps has identified and considered the full range of reasonable alternatives. A range of potential alternatives should be initially investigated reflecting a range of scales and measures, and as alternatives are refined, some would be screened out for reasons such as having excessive cost or unavoidable impacts, not sufficiently addressing the identified problem or opportunity, or other factors. The study report should include some analysis of the eliminated alternatives and reasons for their elimination. The plans that are retained for additional analysis will comprise the range of reasonable alternatives required for the NEPA analysis. Section 234.8 describes the alternatives required in the final array.

    (2) Consideration of nonstructural approaches and nature-based solutions that meet the planning objectives shall be an integral part of the development and evaluation of Federal investments in water resources.

    (3) Each alternative formulated for the PR&G analysis should align with the alternatives evaluated in the corresponding NEPA document.

    (4) The Corps should formulate the alternatives based on an incremental analysis of their benefits and costs to society. The economic, environmental, and social effects of a water resources development project are interrelated. In formulating alternatives to address the identified water resources problem or opportunity, the Corps shall consider each of these effects and seek to maximize net public benefits.

    § 234.7   Evaluation framework.

#### § § 234.7

    (a)  To inform the overall decision-making process, this section describes the common framework and general requirements to be used by the Corps in evaluating and ensuring full consideration of the social, environmental, and economic benefits and costs to society of any separable elements and potential alternatives for Federal investment. This will include their performance with respect to the Guiding Principles and their contributions to the Federal Objective. Any key assumptions that affect the analysis of alternatives shall be clearly described in the study.

    (b)  (1) The Corps' analytical framework for evaluating Federal investments should focus on the key economic, environmental, and social effects that are relevant to the investment decision. Typical NEPA analyses emphasize environmental effects and benefits, including ecosystem services, and these should also be used as a core part of water resources alternatives analysis. A benefit-cost analysis would be conducted for each alternative. Ecosystem services are an important benefit-cost category that should be included in the benefit-cost analysis.

    (2) In addition, the scale of the analysis can be adjusted for a given study. While all analyses should share common elements, how these elements are achieved can depend on the identified problem or opportunity. It is important to establish a consistent analytic approach for each study. When implementing its ASPs, the Corps will consider and, where it deems appropriate, align with the latest Federal methods and guidance (for example, updated OMB Circulars and applicable interagency guidance) to ensure that the analytical framework accounts for all significant economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits, including ecosystem services. Where possible, monetization enables the incorporation of the values placed on the benefits and costs evaluated and provides a way to evaluate trade-offs in common analytical units (dollars). OMB Circulars A-4 and A-94 provide guidance on appropriate use of monetization methods. The Corps anticipates that it will not be possible to monetize all social and environmental costs and benefits of the alternatives. In these cases, the Corps should quantify the social and environmental costs and benefits and when neither monetization nor quantification is possible, the Corps should qualitatively describe the social and environmental costs and benefits in sufficient detail to allow differentiation across alternatives. Relevant monetary, quantitative, and descriptive information will be fully assessed and considered in the analysis.

    (c)  (1) Analysis to support the evaluation of alternatives shall use the best available actionable science, to include Indigenous Knowledge, data, analytical techniques, procedures, models, and tools in ecology, hydrology, economics, engineering, biology, and other disciplines to the extent that sufficient funding is available, and to the extent such information is relevant and appropriate to the subject investment. To the extent feasible, the effects of the alternatives should be monetized. Effects will be monetized, quantified, or described, in that order.

    (2) The level of detail required to support alternatives analysis may vary but should be sufficient to inform the decision-making process efficiently and effectively. The level of detail, scope, and complexity of analyses should be commensurate with the scale, impacts, costs, scientific complexities, uncertainties, risk, and other aspects (such as public concern) inherent in potential decisions.

    (d)  When analyzing potential Federal water resources investments, the Corps shall identify, describe, and quantify (if feasible) areas of risk and uncertainty and consider them in decision-making. Risks and uncertainties shall be identified and described in a manner that is clear and understandable to the public and decision-makers. This includes describing the nature, likelihood, and magnitude of risks, as well as the uncertainties associated with key supporting data, projections, and evaluations of competing alternatives. Risk and uncertainty are inherent in economic analyses as well as the analysis of physical and biological factors, no matter the technique or methodology employed. The study should estimate the extent to which the outcomes from an investment may vary over time from the estimates provided in the study, both in the short-term and in the less predictable future, due to uncertainty. Knowledge of risk and uncertainty and the degree of reliability of the estimated consequences will better inform decision-making. When there are considerable uncertainties concerning the ability of an alternative to function as desired (such as producing the desired outputs and/or the general acceptability of the alternative) the option of pursuing improved data or models should be considered. Reducing risk and uncertainty may involve increased costs or loss of benefits. The advantages and costs of reducing risk and uncertainty should be explicitly considered in formulating alternatives and the overall decision-making process.

    (e)  Adaptive management measures shall be clearly identified and evaluated as part of alternatives to the extent that such measures are commensurate with the significance of the proposed activity and available resources. Adaptive management measures are particularly useful when making management choices in the face of uncertainty, such as when detailed information and tools are not readily available.

    (f)  Conditions resulting from a changing climate shall be identified and accounted for in all stages of the planning process, and uncertainties associated with climate change will be identified and described. Analysis of climate change impacts shall reflect the best available actionable science and will leverage region-specific information from Federal, Tribal, State, local, and non-governmental partners. The Corps shall incorporate a climate-informed science approach considering impacts such as inland and coastal climate change impacts on flood and drought hazards using the most up-to-date science, policies, and tools available. The Corps shall also ensure climate resilience and adaptation are incorporated and considered throughout the planning process and across alternatives, including a discussion on how climate, drought, and ecosystem resilience may intersect for that particular action and can contribute to the economic vitality and water resources resilience of the Nation. The changing climate should inform the understanding of water resources needs and how those needs can potentially be addressed.

    (g)  The consideration of multiple uses, competing demands, and the potential future uses of the water resources shall be taken into account when formulating and evaluating solutions to a water resources problem or challenge. Water availability and efficient use of water shall be considered in designing the alternatives, as shall resilience, when applicable to the purpose of the study. The analysis shall consider water availability, water uses, and resilience over a range of conditions, from too little water in drought and multiple-use scenarios, to too much water in flood scenarios.

    (h)  Nonstructural measures alter the use of existing infrastructure or human activities to generally improve, avoid, or minimize adverse changes to existing hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes. Nonstructural measures may be combined with fewer or smaller traditional structural project components to produce a complete alternative plan or may be used instead of a structural project. In the development of alternatives, the use of natural systems, ecosystem processes, and nature-based solutions shall be considered. Full consideration and reporting on nonstructural and nature-based alternative actions shall be an integral part of the evaluation of Federal water resources investment alternatives, and a full nonstructural in addition to a full nature-based alternative will be included in the final array of alternatives. Nonstructural and nature-based aspects should also be included in the other alternatives in the final array when appropriate.

    (i)  Each of the alternatives considered for a water resources investment must be consistent with the protection of _Tribal treaty rights._ Alternatives that impact Tribal treaty and water rights should be screened out as soon as the Corps becomes aware of such impacts, and the study will document why the alternatives have been screened.

    (j)  Alternatives for water resources investments must be consistent with applicable State laws, including water rights and decrees, to the extent that these do not conflict with Federal laws and regulations. Analyses should identify legal constraints that preclude selection of an otherwise viable alternative.

    (k)  Alternatives for water resources investments must be consistent with meeting treaty and other international obligations. Analyses should identify international obligations that preclude selection of an otherwise viable alternative.

    (l)  The period of analysis for the study shall be documented with an appropriate justification, and used to evaluate each alternative.

    § 234.8   Final array of alternatives.

#### § § 234.8

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section, the final array of alternatives shall include, at a minimum, the following six alternatives:

    (1) A No Action alternative.

    (2) A nonstructural alternative: An alternative that can effectively address the problem through the feasible use of nonstructural approaches.

    (3) A nature-based solution alternative: An alternative that can effectively address the problem through the feasible use of nature-based solutions (including natural systems and ecosystem processes).

    (4) An environmentally preferred alternative.

    (5) An alternative that seeks to maximize net public benefits to society. In developing this alternative, the Corps shall not consider regional economic development effects.

    (6) An alternative that is locally preferred. If this alternative differs from the net public benefits alternative, it will be required to have a comparable level of detail and analyzed using the same analytical framework as the net public benefits alternative.

    (b) The nonstructural and nature-based alternatives do not preclude consideration of these elements in other alternatives. Nonstructural measures and nature-based solutions shall be considered as components of the other alternatives in the final array, essentially providing an integrated or “hybrid” of gray (hard) infrastructure with these other measures.

    (c) The same alternative may be identified as more than one of these required alternatives.

    (d) Mitigation of unavoidable adverse effects associated with each alternative must be included in the alternative and in the analyses.

    (e) If an alternative requires changes in existing laws, regulations, or policies, those changes must be clearly identified and explained.

    (f) If one or more of the required alternatives is not included because the Corps was not able to identify a potential solution that is feasible and consistent with the purpose of the study, the study must document that decision.

    (g) The discussion of the final array of alternatives should include the primary purpose of the analysis; the geographic size of the study area; the types of impacts; the number of people potentially affected and anticipated degree of impact; environmental justice considerations; the size and location of communities potentially affected including the presence of Federally-recognized Tribes or Tribal members; and the type of data and information available from Indigenous Knowledge, collaboration, public involvement, and previous studies.

    § 234.9   Evaluate effects of alternatives.

#### § § 234.9

    (a)  For the final array of alternatives, the analysis should describe, evaluate, and estimate the key social, environmental, and economic effects, and assess the contributions of each alternative to the Guiding Principles. The analysis should identify any impacts to Tribal treaty rights which were unknown earlier in the planning process and which prevent the selection of an alternative.

    (b)  In addition to assessing how alternatives perform with respect to the Guiding Principles, the evaluation procedures shall incorporate methods to evaluate:

    (1) How public benefits of an alternative compare to its costs, including full consideration of all important social, environmental, and economic benefits and costs.

    (2) How alternatives perform against the objectives of the study.

    (3) How alternatives perform against the four formulation criteria: completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability.

    (c)  The report should fully account for the effects to society of alternative plans and their respective contributions to the Federal Objective, relative to the No Action alternative. The analysis will evaluate the economic benefits and costs, environmental benefits and costs, and social benefits and costs of alternatives, regardless of how they are included (monetized, quantified, or described). The consideration of benefits to federally recognized Tribes will be done in direct consultation with the respective Tribal Nation and will supplement the public benefit analysis. To the extent practicable, such costs and benefits must be quantified in a scientifically valid and acceptable way, and such quantified costs shall be monetized where practicable. When monetization or quantification is not possible, costs and benefits must be described in sufficient detail to enable the decision-maker to understand the importance and magnitude of potential changes. For monetized costs and benefits, the present value cost of each alternative must be compared to the present value of the benefit to the public. For quantified but not monetized benefits and costs, the Corps would present the information on an average annual basis, and would also describe how the benefits and costs would accrue over the period of analysis. For qualitatively described benefits and costs, expectations would be described across the period of analysis. The effects of alternative plans are displayed in terms of costs and benefits.

    § 234.10   Compare alternatives.

#### § § 234.10

    (a)  Alternatives shall be compared to each other and to the No Action alternative and shall include a comparison of the ability of the alternatives to perform under changing conditions, including climate change. The alternative (or alternatives) that reasonably meets the Federal Objective and maximizes net public benefits shall be identified. In addition, alternatives may be evaluated separately with respect to other considerations, including distributional effects. These considerations may include:

    (1) Temporal factors, since certain effects may occur at different points in time.

    (2) Spatial factors, since certain costs, benefits, and transfers may accrue to different regions. Regional-scale analyses may be useful to inform regional-level economic development objectives. It is important to note that such regional analyses, while useful, are completely separate from the calculation of net public benefits described in § 234.4(c).

    (3) Beneficiaries. Tribal Nations and stakeholders (including other governmental agencies and communities with environmental justice concerns) may indicate different tradeoffs among the various benefits and costs of a Federal action. Tribal reserved rights, including treaty-protected resources and habitats, are not benefits to the Tribal Nation, rather, they are guaranteed by such treaties. Robust engagement at this stage shall focus on eliciting preferences among the alternatives, their component elements, and their effects. When calculating net benefits, these distributional effects can be examined using techniques like income weighting.

    (b)  Tradeoffs among potential alternatives will be assessed and described throughout the decision-making process and in a manner that informs decision-making. Based on the available analytical information, the Corps would use its professional judgment in making its recommendations on decisions among tradeoffs. The tradeoff displays shall be understandable, transparent, and constructed in a generally consistent fashion for all analyses. The analysis shall include a combination of both tables and explanatory materials to help inform a decision. Displays shall facilitate the evaluation and comparison of alternatives necessary to make the following determination and reflect the following:

    (1) The effectiveness of alternatives in solving the water resources problem and taking advantage of the opportunities identified in the planning process.

    (2) What must be given up in monetary and nonmonetary terms to enjoy the benefits of the various alternatives, relative to the baseline.

    (3) The differences among alternatives.

    (c)  To promote consistency across the Corps, the following tables and information shall be included in the analysis and documentation prepared for a decision process:

    (1)  The analysis must explicitly address the extent to which an alternative achieves each of the following criteria: completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability. This evaluation must be systematic and can include both quantitative and qualitative components.

    (2)  A matrix summarizing the tradeoffs, relative to the baseline, effect-by-effect must be included in the integrated report.

    (3)  Additional text and tables should display other important trade-offs, such as trade-offs along temporal, spatial, and beneficiary dimensions.

    (4)  A summary table displaying the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits as measured (monetized, quantified, quantitative) for each alternative. In addition, the summary table will display the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits which were derived qualitatively. The summary table will also separately include information on the level of risk or uncertainty for each alternative.

    (5)  A table indicating the extent to which the Guiding Principles have been achieved.

    § 234.11   Select the recommended plan.

#### § § 234.11

    (a)  (1) Plan selection will require decision-makers to assess tradeoffs and to consider the extent of both monetized and non-monetized effects. The basis for selection of the recommended plan should be fully reported and documented in a transparent manner, including the criteria and considerations used. This section must provide a discussion about the extent to which the alternatives achieve the Federal Objective and maximize net public benefits to society. The report must include an explanation of the assumptions in the evaluation of monetized and non-monetized benefits and costs. This section will include a summary of elicited Tribal Nation and stakeholder perspectives on the alternatives and their effects.

    (2) The Corps should recommend:

    (i) Authorization of an alternative project, program, or plan;

    (ii) Implementation of an alternative under existing law;

    (iii) Implementation of a project, program or plan by others; or

    (iv) No action.

    (3) In its studies, the Corps shall analyze, evaluate, fully consider, and justify each separable element of the proposed investment independently of the other separable elements, based on its social, environmental, and economic benefits and costs to society.

    (4) The Corps should seek to meet water resources objectives and maximize net public benefits, relative to public costs. It is possible that more than one alternative might reasonably and approximately meet these conditions. “Net public benefits” implies that the anticipated benefits will be presented relative to the costs associated with the accrual of those benefits. Net public benefits can include both quantified and non-quantified benefits. Any recommendation will clearly delineate the Federal water resources project(s) or actions being recommended, including any condition precedent for construction.

    (b)  A recommended plan for a Federal water resources investment that does not maximize net public benefits requires an exception from the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Requests for exception should describe the project or activity, the rationale for the exception, and present relevant data and analysis to support the request.

    § 238.4   Definitions.

#### § § 238.4

    For purposes of this regulation the following definitions apply:

    (a)  are cities, towns, or other incorporated or unincorporated political subdivisions of States that:

    (1) Provide general local government for specific population concentrations, and,

    (2) Occupy an essentially continuous area of developed land, containing such structures as residences, public and commercial buildings, and industrial sites.

    (b)  are the adjustments in land use and the facilities (structural and non-structural) designed to reduce flood damages in urban areas from overflow or backwater due to major storms and snowmelt. They include structural and other engineering modifications to natural streams or to previously modified natural waterways. Flood damage reduction works are designed to modify flood behavior typified by temporary conditions of inundation of normally dry land from the overflow of rivers and streams or from abnormally high coastal waters due to severe storms.

    (c)  are the facilities in urban areas designed to collect and convey runoff from rainfall or snowmelt in the urban area to natural water courses or to previously modified natural waterways. They include storm drains, inlets, manholes, pipes, culverts, conduits, sewers and sewer appurtenances, on-site storage and detention basins, curbs and gutters, and other small drainageways that remove or help to manage runoff in urban areas. _Storm sewer systems_ are designed to solve storm drainage problems, which are typified by excessive accumulation of runoff in depressions; overland sheet flow resulting from rapid snowmelt or rainfall; and excessive accumulation of water at the facilities listed in this paragraph because of their limited capacity.

    § 238.5   Comprehensive planning.

#### § § 238.5

    Coordinated comprehensive planning at the regional or river basin level, or for an urban or metropolitan area, can help to achieve solutions to flood problems that adequately reflect future changes in watershed conditions, and help to avoid short-sighted plans serving only localized situations. This planning is particularly important in areas where significant portions of a watershed are expected to be urbanized in the future. Changes in land use may result in major alterations of the runoff characteristics of the watershed. Hydrologic changes must be projected for the period of analysis. In this effort, responsible local planning organizations should provide information and assist the Corps in development of projected land uses and expected practices for collection and conveyance of runoff over the period of analysis. Conversely, the Corps may be able to provide non-Federal interests with valuable information about water related consequences of alternative land uses and drainage practices.

    § 238.6   General policy.

#### § § 238.6

    (a) Satisfactory resolution of water damage problems in urban areas often involves cooperation between local non-Federal interests and the Federal flood control agencies. In urban or urbanizing areas, provision of a basic drainage system to collect and convey the local runoff to a stream is a non-Federal responsibility. This regulation should not be interpreted to extend the flood damage reduction program into a system of pipes traditionally recognized as a storm drainage system. Flood damage reduction works generally address discharges that represent a serious threat to life and property. The decision criteria outlined below therefore exclude from consideration under flood control authorities small streams and ditches with carrying capacities typical of storm sewer pipes. Location of political boundaries will not be used as a basis for specifying project responsibility. Project responsibilities can be specified as follows:

    (1) Flood damage reduction works, as defined in this regulation, may be accomplished by the Corps of Engineers.

    (2) Construction of storm sewer systems and components thereof will be a non-Federal responsibility. Non-Federal interests have a responsibility to design storm sewer systems so that residual damages are reduced to an acceptable level.

    (b) Consideration will be given to the objectives and requirements of Executive Order 11988 (reference § 238.3(a)) and the general guidelines therefor by the U.S. Water Resources Council (reference § 238.3(b)).

    § 238.7   Decision criteria for participation.

#### § § 238.7

    (a)  (1) Urban water damage problems associated with a natural stream or modified natural waterway may be addressed under the flood control authorities downstream from the point where the flood discharge of such a stream or waterway within an urban area is greater than 800 cubic feet per second for the 10-percent flood (one chance in ten of being equalled or exceeded in any given year) under conditions expected to prevail during the period of analysis. Those drainage areas which lie entirely within the urban area (as established on the basis of future projections, in accordance with § 238.5 of this part), and which are less than 1.5 square miles in area, shall be assumed to lack adequate discharge to meet the above hydrologic criteria. Those urban streams and waterways which receive runoff from land outside the urban area shall not be evaluated using this 1.5 square mile drainage area criterion.

    (2) A number of conditions within a drainage area may limit discharges for the 10-percent flood, without proportionately reducing discharges for larger floods, such as the one-percent flood. Examples include the presence of extremely pervious soils, natural storage (wetlands) or detention basins or diversions with limited capacity. Other conditions could result in a hydrological disparity between the 10- and one-percent flood events.

    (3) Division Engineers, except for NED and POD, are authorized to grant exceptions to the 800 cfs, 10-percent flood discharge criterion specified in this § 238.7(a)(1) whenever both of the following criteria are met:

    (i) The discharge for the one-percent flood exceeds 1800 cfs; and

    (ii) The reason that the 10-percent flood discharge is less than 800 cfs is attributable to a hydrologic disparity similar to those described in § 238.7(a)(2).

    (4) Flood damage reduction works must conform to the definition in § 238.4(b) and must be justified based on Corps of Engineers evaluation procedures in use at the time the evaluation is made. Flood reduction measures, such as dams or diversions, may be located upstream of the particular point where the hydrologic criteria (and area criterion, if appropriate) are met, if economically justified by benefits derived within the stream reach which does qualify for flood control improvement. Similarly, the need to terminate flood control improvements in a safe and economical manner may justify the extension of some portions of the improvements, such as levee tiebacks, into areas upstream of the precise point where Federal flood control authorities become applicable.

    (b)  Water damage problems in urban areas not consistent with the above criteria for flood control will be considered to be a part of local storm drainage to be addressed as part of the consideration of an adequate storm sewer system. The purpose of this system is to collect and convey to a natural stream or modified natural waterway the runoff from rainfall or snowmelt in the urbanized area.

    (c)  (1) Man-made conveyance structures will be assumed to be a part of storm sewer systems except when: (i) A natural stream has been or is to be conveyed in the man-made structure; or (ii) The man-made structure is a cost-effective alternative to improvement of a natural stream for flood damage reduction purposes or is an environmentally preferable and economically justified alternative. Water damage associated with inadequate carrying capacity of man-made structures should be designated as a flood problem or a local drainage problem in a manner consistent with the structure's classification as flood damage reduction works or a part of a storm sewer system.

    (2) Man-made structures that convey sanitary sewage or storm runoff, or a combination of sanitary and storm sewage, to a treatment facility will not be classified as flood damage reduction works. Flows discharged into a natural or previously modified natural waterway for the purpose of conveying the water away from the urbanized area will be assumed to be a part of the flow thereof regardless of quality characteristics.

    (d)  Certain conditions may exist whereby the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or another Federal agency, could jointly undertake a project that would be impractical if one agency were to undertake it alone. The Corps may, for example, under provisions of Section 219 of the Flood Control Act of 1965, design or construct a project that is part of a larger HUD plan for an urban area (see ER 1140-2-302). Such efforts should be undertaken only when requirements cannot be handled better by one agency acting alone. If a joint effort is preferable, then the Corps may participate as required.

    (e)  If a disagreement arises between the Corps and another Federal agency that cannot be resolved at the field level, the matter will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-CWR) WASH DC 20314 for guidance.

    § 238.8   Other participation.

#### § § 238.8

    In addition to providing flood damage reduction works in urban areas, the Corps may provide related services to State and local governments on a reimbursable basis. Under Title III of the Inter-governmental Cooperation Act of 1968, specialized or technical services for which the Corps has specific expertise may be furnished only when such services cannot be procured reasonably and expeditiously from private firms (see ER 1140-2-303).

    § 238.9   Local cooperation.

#### § § 238.9

    (a) Cost sharing and other provisions of local cooperation shall be in conformity with applicable regulations for structural and non-structural flood damage reduction measures.

    (b) Responsible non-Federal entities will be required to provide satisfactory assurances that they will adopt, enforce, and adhere to a sound, comprehensive plan for flood plain management for overflow areas of communities involved. To this end, District Engineers will inform HUD, and other concerned Federal and non-Federal planning and governing agencies, of flood plain management services available under Section 206 of the Flood Control Act of 1960, as amended (33 U.S.C. 709a).

    § 238.10   Coordination with other Federal agencies.

#### § § 238.10

    In conducting flood damage reduction studies, reporting officers shall comply with the 1965 Agreement between the Soil Conservation Service and the Corps (contained in EP 1165-2-2) in determining the responsible Federal agency. Corps personnel should also keep abreast of the public works programs administered by other Federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Farmers Home Administration and the Department of Commerce, in order to coordinate flood control improvements with storm sewer system improvements and to avoid program overlap. Coordination of planning activities with A-95 clearinghouses will help to achieve this objective (see ER 1105-2-811).

    § 241.4   General policy.

#### § § 241.4

    (a) Procedures described herein establish an “ability to pay” test which will be applied to all flood control projects. As a result of the application of the test, some projects will be cost-shared by the non-Federal interest at a lower level than the standard non-Federal share that would be required under the provisions of section 103 of Pub. L. 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213. The “standard share”, as used herein, refers to the non-Federal share that would apply to the project before any ability to pay consideration.

    (b) Section 103(m) requires that all cost-sharing agreements for flood control covered by the terms of section 103(a) or 103(b) be subject to the ability to pay test. The test must therefore be applied not only to projects specifically authorized by Congress, but to the continuing authority projects constructed under section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701r), section 205 of the 1948 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701s), and section 208 of the 1954 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. 701g), all as amended.

    (c) The ability to pay test shall be conducted independently of any analysis of a project sponsor's ability to finance its ultimate share of proposed project costs. The ability to finance is addressed in a statement of financial capability which considers current borrowing constraints, alternative sources of liquidity, etc. It is therefore much more narrowly defined than the ability to pay test, which considers the underlying resource base of the community as a whole. The ability to pay test shall not be used to affect project scope, or to change budgetary priorities among projects competing for scarce Federal funds.

    (d) Any reductions in the level of non-Federal cost-sharing as a result of the application of this test will be applied to construction costs only. Operations, maintenance and rehabilitation responsibilities are unaffected by the ability to pay test.

    (e) When projects are eligible for credits as outlined in ER 1165-2-29, reference § 241.3(e), the ability to pay test will be applied before any adjustments are made for credits. If the ability to pay test results in a lower non-Federal share, the allowable amount of credits will be limited by the lower share.

    (f) The test is based on the following principles:

    (1) Since the standard non-Federal cost-share is substantially less than full costs in every case, the ability to pay test should be structured so that reductions in the level of cost-sharing will be granted in only a limited number of cases of severe economic hardship.

    (2) The test should depend not only on the economic circumstances within a project area, but also on the conditions of the state(s) in which the project area is located. Although states' policies with respect to supporting local interests on flood control projects are not uniform, the state represents a potential source of financial assistance which should be considered in the analysis.

    (3) The alternative level of cost-sharing determined under the ability to pay principle should be governed in part by project benefits. If, as a result of the project, local beneficiaries receive more income, or are required to use fewer resources on flood damage repair or replacement, or on flood insurance, a portion of these resources should be available to pay for the non-Federal share, even in those cases where an analysis of current economic conditions indicates that there are relatively limited resources in the project area and its state.

    (4) Since project benefits represent availability of resources in the future, but not the present, project sponsors should be permitted to defer a certain percentage of the non-Federal share whenever current economic circumstances suggest that non-Federal resources may be limited.

    (g) The Non-Federal interest may, at its discretion, waive the application of the ability to pay test. In this case, the Non-Federal interest shall be considered to have the ability to pay the standard cost-share and no further economic inquiry will be required.

    § 241.5   Procedures for estimating the alternative cost-share.

#### § § 241.5

    (a)  Determine the maximum possible reduction in the level of non-Federal cost-sharing for any project.

    (1) Calculate the ratio of flood control benefits (developed using the Water Resources Council's —ref. § 241.3(b)) to flood control costs for the project based on the discount rate which the Corps is currently using to evaluate projects. Costs include operations and maintenance as well as first costs. Divide the result by four. For example, if the project's (or separable element's) benefit-cost ratio is 1.2:1, the factor for this project equals 0.3. If a project has been authorized for construction without a benefit-cost ratio calculated in accordance with the _Principles and Guidelines_, determination of the ratio is a prerequisite for consideration under the ability to pay provision.

    (2) If the factor determined in § 241.5(a)(1), when expressed as a percentage, is greater than the standard level of cost-sharing, the standard level will apply.

    (3) If the factor determined in § 241.5(a)(1), when expressed as a percentage, is less than the standard level of cost-sharing, projects may be eligible for either a reduction in the non-Federal share to this “benefits based floor” (BBF), or for a partial reduction to a share between the standard level and the BBF, as determined by the procedures in step two, § 243.5. In no case however, will the non-Federal cost-share be less than five percent.

    (b)  Projects may qualify for the full amount of the reduction in cost-sharing calculated in Step one, or for some fraction of the reduction in cost-sharing, depending on a measure of the current economic resources of the project area and of the state or states in which the project is located.

    (1) To assure consistency, the calculations in § 241.5(b) (2) and (3) will be performed by HQUSACE and distributed to all FOA's via Engineering Circulars. The information will be updated and distributed to HQUSACE and to the field as soon as new data are available. The procedures may be verified for any single county or state using the sources cited.

    (2) For each of the three latest calendar years for which information is available, determine the level of per capita personal income in the state in which the project beneficiaries are located, and compare this to the national average of per capita personal income. Source: Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as published yearly in the April  (If the project beneficiaries are located in Alaska or Hawaii, divide the per capita personal income figure by one plus the percentage used in the Federal Government's cost of living pay differential for Federal workers who purchase local retail and who use private housing, employed in Anchorage, AK or Oahu, HI as contained in References § 241.3(c) and (d).) Determine the state's per capita personal income as an index number in comparison to the national average (U.S. = 100), and calculate the three year average of the state's index number.

    (3) For each of the three latest calendar years for which information is available, determine the level of per capita personal income in the county where the project beneficiaries are located (the “project area”), and compare this to the national average of per capita personal income. Source: Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as published yearly in the April  (If the project beneficiaries are located in Alaska or Hawaii, divide the county's per capita personal income figure by one plus the percentage used in the Federal Government's cost of living pay differential for Federal workers who purchase local retail and who use private housing, employed in Anchorage, AK or Oahu, HI.) Calculate the index for the county's per capita personal income to the national average (U.S. = 100), and calculate the three year average of the county's index number.

    (4) When the project area, as determined by the location of the project's beneficiaries, includes more than one county, calculate a composite project area index by taking a weighted average of the county index numbers, the weights being equal to the relative levels of benefits received in each county. When the project area includes more than one state, the state index for the project should be calculated using the same weighting technique.

    (5) Calculate an “Eligibility Factor” for the project according to the following formula:

    (6) Since estimates (available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis) of per capita personal income for Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. territories are well below the national average, the eligibility factor for projects in these areas is administratively established to be equal to 1.

    (7) For flood control projects sponsored by Native American tribes or villages, the EF shall be calculated using information on tribe or village income as a replacement factor for both the area and state factor (that is multiply the replacement income factor by both b and b and subtract each from a in the equation in § *2*4*1*.5(b)(5)). The replacement factor will be tribe or village income as a percentage of the national average for the equivalent definition of income (for example a Tribe's median family income as a percentage of the median family income for all U.S. families). The data should be the latest available information. It is acceptable, but not required that the data be obtained from the Bureau of the Census,  part 1, Table 10, or  Table 252. Since both sources contain information for Native Americans living on reservations, rather than all Tribe or Village members, the sources should be used only when appropriate, or when no better information is available.

    (c)  If a flood control project has a BBF which is less than the standard cost-share and an EF which is greater than zero, the non-Federal cost-share will be reduced. The alternative non-Federal share will be calculated and reported to the nearest one tenth of one percent. The actual reduction is determined by applying the ability to pay formula to the basic flood control cost-sharing provisions of section 103 of Pub. L. 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2213, as follows:

    (1) When EF ≥1, non-Federal cost-share = BBF

    (2) For structural projects covered by section 103(a), when 0 <EF <1:

    (i) If LERRD equals or exceeds 45 percent:

    (ii) If LERRD exceeds 20 percent but is less than 45 percent:

    (iii) If LERRD is less than 20 percent:

    (3) For non-structural projects covered by section 103(b), when 0 <EF <1:

    (4) In no case however, can the non-Federal share be less than five percent, even if the calculation made in § 241.5(c) (1), (2), or (3) results in a smaller number.

    (5)  LERRD equals the costs of lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas expressed as a percentage of total project costs. The BBF and numerical terms in the equations above are also expressed as percentages.

    (d) Additional consideration for high cost projects. For any project where the normal non-Federal share exceeds 35 percent, and the per capita non-Federal cost (, normal non-Federal share of total construction costs divided by the population in the sponsor's geographic jurisdiction) exceeds $300, the non-Federal share under the ability to pay provision will be either LERRD's (, no cash requirement) or 35 percent, whichever is greater. If LERRD's exceed 50 percent, the non-Federal share remains at 50 percent. Projects which qualify under the benefits and income tests will receive the reduction under the high cost criteria only if the high cost criteria results in a greater reduction in the non-Federal cost share.

    § 241.6   Deferred payments for certain qualifying projects.

#### § § 241.6

    (a) Whenever a project's Eligibility Factor exceeds zero, the project sponsor will be permitted to defer a portion of its share of flood control costs. The maximum allowable amount deferred equals the total non-Federal share less (for structural projects) five percent of total project costs and less (for all projects) any amounts for LERRD paid for or acquired by the sponsor prior to the time the PCA is signed. If for example, the non-Federal share of a structural project = 35.0 percent (after the ability to pay adjustment, if any) of which 10 percent is LERRD already paid for by the local sponsor, the maximum allowable amount to be deferred = 20 percent of project flood control costs (35 less the 5 percent cash requirements, less the 10 percent LERRD already acquired). Deferred payments at the option of the sponsor will be allowed regardless of the outcome of the benefits test described in § 241.5(a) whenever the Eligibility Factor exceeds zero.

    (b) When EF ≥1, the project sponsor may defer as much as the maximum allowable amount as described in § 241.6(a).

    (c) When 0 <EF <1, the sponsor may defer a fraction of the maximum allowable amount described in § 241.6(a), where the fraction equals the Eligibility Factor expressed to three decimal places. Continuing the example described in § 241.6(a), if EF = .712, total allowed deferral equals .712 × 20 percent = 14.2 percent of total project costs.

    (d) The deferred payment can be made in equal installments over any period of time selected by the non-Federal sponsor, provided that all repayments are made between the end of construction and thirty years thereafter. The amount repaid shall include interest during the repayment period as well as interest for the appropriate portion of the construction period for any amounts deferred prior to the end of construction. The rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 106 of Pub. L. 99-662, 33 U.S.C. 2216.

    § 241.7   Application of test.

#### § § 241.7

    (a) A preliminary ability to pay test will be applied during the study phase of any proposed project. If the ability to pay cost-share is lower than the standard share, the revised estimated cost-share will be used for budgetary and other planning purposes.

    (b) The official application of the ability to pay test will be made at the time the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the Corps of Engineers and the Non-Federal sponsor is signed. For structural flood control projects, the standard level of cost-sharing will not be known until the end of the project (since the standard level as specified in section 103(a), 33 U.S.C. 2213, includes LERRD). In this case, if the Eligibility Factor is greater than zero but less than one, the ability to pay non-Federal share will be determined using estimated costs.

    (c) The PCA for all projects subject to the ability to pay test will include a “whereas” clause indicating the results of the test. If the project is eligible for a lower non-Federal share:

    (1) The revised share will be specified in the PCA (there will be no recalculation of this share once the PCA is signed).

    (2) An exhibit attached to the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) will include the Benefits Based Floor (BBF) determined in § 241.5(a): the Eligibility Factor (EF) determined in § 241.5(b): If the Eligibility Factor is greater than zero but less than one, the estimated standard non-Federal share; the formula used in determining the ability to pay share as described in § 241.5(c)(1) through (c)(4); and a display of the non-Federal cost share under the high cost criteria described in § 241.5(d).

    (d) If at the time of project completion, the standard non-Federal share based on actual costs is less than the ability to pay share specified in the PCA, the standard share will apply.

    (e)  (1) If the standard LERRD plus cash requirement exceeds the ability to pay cost-share, the Federal Government will make any necessary adjustments in expenditures in the following order: First, paying any cash requirement in excess of five percent of total project costs (if any) that would, under standard cost-sharing, have been the responsibility of the non-Federal sponsor; second, making payments for LERRD; and third, providing for reimbursement at the end of construction. Federal payments for LERRD will be made only after the non-Federal payment for LERRD reaches a percentage of total project costs equal to the ability to pay non-Federal cost-share less the five percent cash requirement. If such arrangements are necessary, the PCA should be prepared to reflect agreement on the best manner available for acquisition of those LERRD over the limiting percentage, or for reimbursing the sponsor upon completion of construction.

    (2) The non-Federal sponsor will be required to provide a cash payment equal to the minimum of five percent of estimated project costs, regardless of the outcome of the ability to pay test, unless any or all of the five percent cash requirement is waived by application of the high cost criteria described in § 241.5(d). The project sponsor shall make cash payments during construction at a rate such that the amount of non-Federal payments in each year, as a percentage of total non-Federal cash payments, equals the amount of Federal expenditures (including sunk pre-construction engineering and design costs as a first year Federal construction expenditure) as a percentage of total Federal expenditures. Total Federal expenditures include cash payments for construction and if necessary (due to ability to pay considerations), for LERRD, and for reimbursement to the non-Federal sponsor. Total Federal expenditures for the purpose of this calculation, do not include expenditures which allow the non-Federal sponsor to defer payment of the non-Federal share under the provisions of this rule.

    (f) For non-structural projects, reductions in the non-Federal cost-share as a result of the ability to pay test will not affect the procedures for determining the non-Federal and Federal payment schedules. For non-structural projects, no specific cash payments during construction are required by law.

#### § § 242.5

    (a) The Corps of Engineers Flood Plain Management Services Program provides a wide range of flood plain and related assistance upon request. Depending on the complexity of the request, either a nonnegotiated Fee Schedule or a negotiated agreement will be used to recover the cost of services provided to Federal agencies and private persons. This part involves only the nonnegotiated Fee Schedule.

    (b) State, regional, or local governments or other non-Federal public agencies will be provided Flood Plain Management Services without charge.

    § 242.6   Fee schedule.

#### § § 242.6

    (a)  The Fee Schedule described in this section will be used to recover the cost for Flood Plain Management Services requiring more than ten minutes and up to one work day to provide. The Fee Schedule has been designed to minimize administrative costs and to allow the flexibility needed to recover the approximate total costs for services provided to Federal agencies and private persons.

    (b)  For establishing charges, services covered by the Fee Schedule have been divided into five levels as follows:

    (1) Level 1 includes the provision of basic information from readily available data that does not require technical evaluation or documentation and is transmitted by form letter to the customer.

    (2) Level 2 includes the provision of information from readily available data that requires minimal technical evaluation and is transmitted by form letter to the customer.

    (3) Level 3 includes the provision of information that requires some file search, a brief technical evaluation, and documentation of results by a form letter or brief composed letter to the customer.

    (4) Level 4 includes the provision of information and assistance that requires moderate file search, a brief technical evaluation, and documentation of results in a composed letter to the customer.

    (5) Level 5 includes the provision of information and assistance that requires significant file search or retrieval of archived data, a moderate technical evaluation, and documentation of results in a brief letter report to the customer.

    (c)  The Fee Schedule will be used Corps-wide. As requests are received, the responding office will select the appropriate level on the Fee Schedule to determine the charge for providing the service.

    (d)  The services will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis after payment has been received.

    (e)  The Fee Schedule, including a brief description of the services in each of the five levels and the related charges, is shown in Table 1 to this section. The fee for each level is based on a Corps-wide average of estimated current costs for providing that level of service.

    (f)  The fees shown in the Fee Schedule will be reviewed each fiscal year using the most current cost data available. If necessary, the Fee Schedule will be revised after public notice and comment.

  PART 245—REMOVAL OF WRECKS AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS

### Part 245

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 33 U.S.C. 1, 409, 411-415; 10 U.S.C. 3012.

**Source:** Source: 53 FR 27513, July 21, 1988, unless otherwise noted.

    § 245.1   Purpose.

#### § § 245.1

    This part describes administrative procedures and policy used by the Corps of Engineers in exercising its authority for wreck removal. Procedures are intended to insure that the impacts of obstructions are minimized, while recognizing certain rights of owners, operators and lessees.

    § 245.3   Applicability.

#### § § 245.3

    (a) These procedures apply to the removal of wrecks or other obstructions within the navigable waters of the United States, as defined in part 329 of this chapter.

    (b) This part does not apply to the summary removal or destruction of a vessel by the Coast Guard under authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321), or to any removal actions involving obstructive bridges which are subject to separate regulation under part 114 of this title.

    (c) For vessels which were sunk or wrecked prior to November 17, 1986, the statutory obligation to remove belongs solely to the owner (not the operator or lessee), and the owner's obligation to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for federal removal is limited to cases of voluntary or careless sinking.

    § 245.5   Definitions.

#### § § 245.5

    means the surrendering of all rights to a vessel (or other obstruction) and its cargo by the owner, or owners if vessel and cargo are separately owned.

    is an obstruction, usually sunken, that presents sufficient danger to navigation so as to require expeditious, affirmative action such as marking, removal, or redefinition of a designated waterway to provide for navigational safety.

    is anything that restricts, endangers or interferes with navigation.

    means the owner of a vessel and/or cargo, or an operator or lessee where the operator or lessee has substantial control of the vessel's operation.

    as used in this part includes any ship, boat, barge, raft, or other water craft.

    § 245.10   General policy.

#### § § 245.10

    (a)  The Corps of Engineers coordinates its wreck removal program with the Coast Guard through interagency agreement, to insure a coordinated approach to the protection of federal interests in navigation and safety. Disagreements at the field level are resolved by referral to higher authority within each agency, ultimately (within the Corps of Engineers) to the Director of Civil Works, who retains the final authority to make independent determinations where Corps responsibilities and activities are affected.

    (b)  Primary responsibility for removal of wrecks or other obstructions lies with the owner, lessee, or operator. Where an obstruction presents a hazard to navigation which warrants removal, the District Engineer will attempt to identify the owner or other responsible party and vigorously pursue removal by that party before undertaking Corps removal.

    (c)  Obstructions which impede or stop navigation; or pose an immediate and significant threat to life, property, or a structure that facilitates navigation; may be removed by the Corps of Engineers under the emergency authority of section 20 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as amended.

    (d)  In other than emergency situations, all reported obstructions will be evaluated jointly by the District Engineer and the Coast Guard district for impact on safe navigation and for determination of a course of action, which may include the need for removal. Obstructions which are not a hazard to general navigation will not be removed by the Corps of Engineers.

    (e)  Where removal is warranted and the responsible party cannot be identified or does not pursue removal diligently, the District Engineer may pursue removal by the Corps of Engineers under section 19 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as amended, following procedures outlined in this CFR part.

    § 245.15   Delegation.

#### § § 245.15

    District Engineers may undertake removal without prior approval of the Chief of Engineers provided the cost does not exceed $100,000. Removals estimated to cost above $100,000 require advance approval of the Director of Civil Works.

    § 245.20   Determination of hazard to navigation.

#### § § 245.20

    (a) Upon receiving a report of a wreck or other obstruction, District Engineers will consult with the Coast Guard district to jointly determine whether the obstruction poses a hazard to navigation.

    (b) Factors to be considered, as a minimum, include:

    (1) Location of the obstruction in relation to the navigable channel and other navigational traffic patterns.

    (2) Navigational difficulty in the vicinity of the obstruction.

    (3) Clearance or depth of water over the obstruction, fluctuation of water level, and other hydraulic characteristics in the vicinity.

    (4) Type and density of commercial and recreational vessel traffic, or other marine activity, in the vicinity of the obstruction.

    (5) Physical characteristics of the obstruction, including cargo, if any.

    (6) Possible movement of the obstruction.

    (7) Location of the obstruction in relation to existing aids to navigation.

    (8) Prevailing and historical weather conditions.

    (9) Length of time the obstruction has been in existence.

    (10) History of vessel accidents involving the obstruction.

    § 245.25   Determination of remedial action.

#### § § 245.25

    (a)  After a determination has been made that an obstruction presents a hazard to navigation, District Engineers will consult with the Coast Guard district to determine appropriate remedial action for the specific situation.

    (b)  The following options, or some combination of these options, may be considered:

    (1) No action.

    (2) Charting.

    (3) Broadcast notice to mariners and publication of navigational safety information.

    (4) Marking.

    (5) Redefinition of navigational area (e.g., channel, fairway, anchorage, etc.).

    (6) Removal.

    § 245.30   Identification of responsible parties.

#### § § 245.30

    (a)  When marking or removal are determined to be appropriate remedial action and no emergency situation exists, the District Engineer will investigate to determine the owner or, if the owner cannot be determined, the lessee or operator. If cargo is involved, ownership will be separately determined.

    (b)  If the owner or other responsible party can be determined, the District Engineer and/or the Coast Guard will send a notice, via certified mail, advising them of their legal obligation to mark (referencing Coast Guard requirements) and to remove the obstruction, and of the legal consequences for failure to do so, with a request for prompt reply of intent.

    (c)  If the owner or responsible party cannot be determined from investigation, the District Engineer will publish a legal advertisement in a newspaper nearest the location of the obstruction and in a newspaper of at least 25,000 circulation, addressed “To Whom It May Concern,” requiring removal by the owner, lessee or operator. The advertisement will be published at least once a week for 30 days.

    § 245.35   Judgments to require removal.

#### § § 245.35

    When the owner or responsible party has been identified, and refuses or fails to take prompt action toward removal, the District Engineer may seek a judgment by the district court requiring removal.

    § 245.40   Removal by responsible party.

#### § § 245.40

    (a)  If the owner, lessee or operator agrees to remove a hazard to navigation, the District Engineer should ascertain that:

    (1) Marking is accomplished promptly and is maintained,

    (2) The plan for removal and disposal is reasonable and acceptable to the District Engineer,

    (3) Removal operations do not unreasonably interfere with navigation,

    (4) All conditions of the Corps of Engineers permit are met, and

    (5) Removal operations are pursued diligently.

    (b)  If the removal actions are not proceeding satisfactorily, the District Engineer will notify the responsible party of the deficiencies and provide a reasonable time for correction. If not corrected promptly, the District Engineer may declare the wreck “abandoned” and proceed with actions toward Corps removal.

    § 245.45   Abandonment.

#### § § 245.45

    (a)  Abandonment is the surrendering of all rights to a vessel (or similar obstruction) and its cargo by the owner, or owners if vessel and cargo are separately owned. In all cases other than emergency, abandonment will be established as a precondition to Corps removal, to avoid a “taking” of private property for public purposes. Abandonment is established by either:

    (1) Affirmative action on the part of the owner declaring intention to abandon, or

    (2) Failure to commence immediate removal of the obstruction and prosecute such removal diligently.

    (b)  The Corps of Engineers will not “accept” a notice of abandonment. Any notice of abandonment received by the Corps of Engineers will be acknowledged only, and will stand by itself as a declaration. Abandonment by the operator or lessee alone does not constitute abandonment.

    (c)  The determination of whether removal is commenced immediately and prosecuted diligently will be made by the District Engineer based on the degree of hazard to navigation, the difficulty and complexity of the removal operation, and the appropriateness of the removal effort. When no removal actions are being undertaken and the District Engineer is unable to identify the owner through investigation or 30 days of public notice, abandonment is presumed.

    (d)  If vessel and cargo are separately owned, or ownership of cargo is uncertain, abandonment of vessel and cargo will be established separately.

    (e)  After abandonment is established, the owner may no longer undertake removal or make any claim upon the vessel (or other obstruction) or its cargo, unless expressly permitted by the District Engineer.

    (f)  The abandonment of a wreck or other obstruction does not remove the owner's liability for the cost of removal and disposal if removal is undertaken by the Corps of Engineers, except in cases of nonnegligent sinking which occurred prior to November 17, 1986.

    § 245.50   Removal by Corps of Engineers.

#### § § 245.50

    (a)  In non-emergency situations, the District Engineer may undertake removal action (within the limits of delegation) after all of the following conditions have been met:

    (1) A determination has been made, in consultation with the Coast Guard, that the obstruction is a hazard to navigation,

    (2) The District Engineer and the Coast Guard agree on a course of action which includes the need for removal (or, if a conflict exists, the need for removal has been resolved at higher level),

    (3) The District Engineer has made a reasonable attempt to identify the owner, operator, or lessee, and

    (4) Abandonment of the wreck or obstruction has been established.

    (b)  In emergency situations, the District Engineer may bypass (within the limits of delegation) any or all of the four conditions in the preceding paragraph if, in his judgment, circumstances require more immediate action, and if either one of the following conditions are met:

    (1) The obstruction impedes or stops navigation, or

    (2) The obstruction poses an immediate threat to life, property, or a structure that facilitates navigation.

    § 245.55   Permit requirements.

#### § § 245.55

    (a)  Marking and removal operations by the owner, operator or lessee are normally permitted under nationwide permits for such activities as outlined in part 330 of this chapter. The activities must meet certain conditions as stated in those regulations, and additional permits may still be required from state or local agencies.

    (b)  The Corps of Engineers may add individual or regional conditions to the nationwide permit, or require an individual permit on a case-by-case basis.

    § 245.60   Reimbursement for removal costs.

#### § § 245.60

    The Corps of Engineers will seek reimbursement from the owner, operator, or lessee, if identified, for all removal and disposal costs in excess of the value of the recovered vessel (or other obstruction) and cargo.

  PART 320—GENERAL REGULATORY POLICIES

### Part 320

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401  33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 U.S.C. 1413.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41220, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 320.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 320.1

    (a)  (1) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been involved in regulating certain activities in the nation's waters since 1890. Until 1968, the primary thrust of the Corps' regulatory program was the protection of navigation. As a result of several new laws and judicial decisions, the program has evolved to one involving the consideration of the full public interest by balancing the favorable impacts against the detrimental impacts. This is known as the “public interest review.” The program is one which reflects the national concerns for both the protection and utilization of important resources.

    (2) The Corps is a highly decentralized organization. Most of the authority for administering the regulatory program has been delegated to the thirty-six district engineers and eleven division engineers. A district engineer's decision on an approved jurisdictional determination, a permit denial, or a declined individual permit is subject to an administrative appeal by the affected party in accordance with the procedures and authorities contained in 33 CFR part 331. Such administrative appeal must meet the criteria in 33 CFR 331.5; otherwise, no administrative appeal of that decision is allowed. The terms “approved jurisdictional determination,” “permit denial,” and “declined permit” are defined at 33 CFR 331.2. There shall be no administrative appeal of any issued individual permit that an applicant has accepted, unless the authorized work has not started in waters of the United States, and that issued permit is subsequently modified by the district engineer pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7 (see 33 CFR 331.5(b)(1)). An affected party must exhaust any administrative appeal available pursuant to 33 CFR part 331 and receive a final Corps decision on the appealed action prior to filing a lawsuit in the Federal courts (see 33 CFR 331.12).

    (3) The Corps seeks to avoid unnecessary regulatory controls. The general permit program described in 33 CFR parts 325 and 330 is the primary method of eliminating unnecessary federal control over activities which do not justify individual control or which are adequately regulated by another agency.

    (4) The Corps is neither a proponent nor opponent of any permit proposal. However, the Corps believes that applicants are due a timely decision. Reducing unnecessary paperwork and delays is a continuing Corps goal.

    (5) The Corps believes that state and federal regulatory programs should complement rather than duplicate one another. The Corps uses general permits, joint processing procedures, interagency review, coordination, and authority transfers (where authorized by law) to reduce duplication.

    (6) The Corps has authorized its district engineers to issue formal determinations concerning the applicability of the Clean Water Act or the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 to activities or tracts of land and the applicability of general permits or statutory exemptions to proposed activities. A determination pursuant to this authorization shall constitute a Corps final agency action. Nothing contained in this section is intended to affect any authority EPA has under the Clean Water Act.

    (b)  This part and the parts that follow (33 CFR parts 321 through 330) prescribe the statutory authorities, and general and special policies and procedures applicable to the review of applications for Department of the Army (DA) permits for controlling certain activities in waters of the United States or the oceans. This part identifies the various federal statutes which require that DA permits be issued before these activities can be lawfully undertaken; and related Federal laws and the general policies applicable to the review of those activities. Parts 321 through 324 and 330 address special policies and procedures applicable to the following specific classes of activities:

    (1) Dams or dikes in navigable waters of the United States (part 321);

    (2) Other structures or work including excavation, dredging, and/or disposal activities, in navigable waters of the United States (part 322);

    (3) Activities that alter or modify the course, condition, location, or capacity of a navigable water of the United States (part 322);

    (4) Construction of artificial islands, installations, and other devices on the outer continental shelf (part 322);

    (5) Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (part 323);

    (6) Activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters (part 324); and

    (7) Nationwide general permits for certain categories of activities (part 330).

    (c)  DA permits for the above described activities are issued under various forms of authorization. These include individual permits that are issued following a review of individual applications and general permits that authorize a category or categories of activities in specific geographical regions or nationwide. The term “general permit” as used in these regulations (33 CFR parts 320 through 330) refers to both those regional permits issued by district or division engineers on a regional basis and to nationwide permits which are issued by the Chief of Engineers through publication in the  and are applicable throughout the nation. The nationwide permits are found in 33 CFR part 330. If an activity is covered by a general permit, an application for a DA permit does not have to be made. In such cases, a person must only comply with the conditions contained in the general permit to satisfy requirements of law for a DA permit. In certain cases pre-notification may be required before initiating construction. (See 33 CFR 330.7)

    (d)  General policies for evaluating permit applications are found in this part. Special policies that relate to particular activities are found in parts 321 through 324. The procedures for processing individual permits and general permits are contained in 33 CFR part 325. The terms “navigable waters of the United States” and “waters of the United States” are used frequently throughout these regulations, and it is important from the outset that the reader understand the difference between the two. “Navigable waters of the United States” are defined in 33 CFR part 329. These are waters that are navigable in the traditional sense where permits are required for certain work or structures pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. “Waters of the United States” are defined in 33 CFR part 328. These waters include more than navigable waters of the United States and are the waters where permits are required for the discharge of dredged or fill material pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

    § 320.2   Authorities to issue permits.

#### § § 320.2

    (a) Section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, approved March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401) (hereinafter referred to as section 9), prohibits the construction of any dam or dike across any navigable water of the United States in the absence of Congressional consent and approval of the plans by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army. Where the navigable portions of the waterbody lie wholly within the limits of a single state, the structure may be built under authority of the legislature of that state if the location and plans or any modification thereof are approved by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of the Army. The instrument of authorization is designated a permit (See 33 CFR part 321.) Section 9 also pertains to bridges and causeways but the authority of the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Engineers with respect to bridges and causeways was transferred to the Secretary of Transportation under the Department of Transportation Act of October 15, 1966 (49 U.S.C. 1155g(6)(A)). A DA permit pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act is required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States associated with bridges and causeways. (See 33 CFR part 323.)

    (b) Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act approved March 3, 1899, (33 U.S.C. 403) (hereinafter referred to as section 10), prohibits the unauthorized obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the United States. The construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of the United States, the excavating from or depositing of material in such waters, or the accomplishment of any other work affecting the course, location, condition, or capacity of such waters is unlawful unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army. The instrument of authorization is designated a permit. The authority of the Secretary of the Army to prevent obstructions to navigation in navigable waters of the United States was extended to artificial islands, installations, and other devices located on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the outer continental shelf, by section 4(f) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 as amended (43 U.S.C. 1333(e)). (See 33 CFR part 322.)

    (c) Section 11 of the Rivers and Harbors Act approved March 3, 1899, (33 U.S.C. 404), authorizes the Secretary of the Army to establish harbor lines channelward of which no piers, wharves, bulkheads, or other works may be extended or deposits made without approval of the Secretary of the Army. Effective May 27, 1970, permits for work shoreward of those lines must be obtained in accordance with section 10 and, if applicable, section 404 of the Clean Water Act (see § 320.4(o) of this part).

    (d) Section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act approved March 3, 1899, (33 U.S.C. 407), provides that the Secretary of the Army, whenever the Chief of Engineers determines that anchorage and navigation will not be injured thereby, may permit the discharge of refuse into navigable waters. In the absence of a permit, such discharge of refuse is prohibited. While the prohibition of this section, known as the Refuse Act, is still in effect, the permit authority of the Secretary of the Army has been superseded by the permit authority provided the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the states under sections 402 and 405 of the Clean Water Act, (33 U.S.C. 1342 and 1345). (See 40 CFR parts 124 and 125.)

    (e) Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act approved March 3, 1899, (33 U.S.C. 408), provides that the Secretary of the Army, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, may grant permission for the temporary occupation or use of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, dike, levee, wharf, pier, or other work built by the United States. This permission will be granted by an appropriate real estate instrument in accordance with existing real estate regulations.

    (f) Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) (hereinafter referred to as section 404) authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States at specified disposal sites. (See 33 CFR part 323.) The selection and use of disposal sites will be in accordance with guidelines developed by the Administrator of EPA in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army and published in 40 CFR part 230. If these guidelines prohibit the selection or use of a disposal site, the Chief of Engineers shall consider the economic impact on navigation and anchorage of such a prohibition in reaching his decision. Furthermore, the Administrator can deny, prohibit, restrict or withdraw the use of any defined area as a disposal site whenever he determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing and after consultation with the Secretary of the Army, that the discharge of such materials into such areas will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. (See 40 CFR part 230).

    (g) Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1413) (hereinafter referred to as section 103), authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in the ocean where it is determined that the disposal will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities. The selection of disposal sites will be in accordance with criteria developed by the Administrator of the EPA in consultation with the Secretary of the Army and published in 40 CFR parts 220 through 229. However, similar to the EPA Administrator's limiting authority cited in paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator can prevent the issuance of a permit under this authority if he finds that the disposal of the material will result in an unacceptable adverse impact on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds, wildlife, fisheries, or recreational areas. (See 33 CFR part 324).

    § 320.3   Related laws.

#### § § 320.3

    (a) Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1341) requires any applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in a discharge of a pollutant into waters of the United States to obtain a certification from the State in which the discharge originates or would originate, or, if appropriate, from the interstate water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over the affected waters at the point where the discharge originates or would originate, that the discharge will comply with the applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards. A certification obtained for the construction of any facility must also pertain to the subsequent operation of the facility.

    (b) Section 307(c) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)), requires federal agencies conducting activities, including development projects, directly affecting a state's coastal zone, to comply to the maximum extent practicable with an approved state coastal zone management program. Indian tribes doing work on federal lands will be treated as a federal agency for the purpose of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Act also requires any non-federal applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct an activity affecting land or water uses in the state's coastal zone to furnish a certification that the proposed activity will comply with the state's coastal zone management program. Generally, no permit will be issued until the state has concurred with the non-federal applicant's certification. This provision becomes effective upon approval by the Secretary of Commerce of the state's coastal zone management program. (See 15 CFR part 930.)

    (c) Section 302 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1432), authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with other interested federal agencies and with the approval of the President, to designate as marine sanctuaries those areas of the ocean waters, of the Great Lakes and their connecting waters, or of other coastal waters which he determines necessary for the purpose of preserving or restoring such areas for their conservation, recreational, ecological, or aesthetic values. After designating such an area, the Secretary of Commerce shall issue regulations to control any activities within the area. Activities in the sanctuary authorized under other authorities are valid only if the Secretary of Commerce certifies that the activities are consistent with the purposes of Title III of the Act and can be carried out within the regulations for the sanctuary.

    (d) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) declares the national policy to encourage a productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment. Section 102 of that Act directs that “to the fullest extent possible: (1) The policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act, and

    (2) All agencies of the Federal Government shall * * * insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values may be given appropriate consideration in decision-making along with economic and technical considerations * * *”. (See Appendix B of 33 CFR part 325.)

    (e) The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a, ), the Migratory Marine Game-Fish Act (16 U.S.C. 760c-760g), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-666c) and other acts express the will of Congress to protect the quality of the aquatic environment as it affects the conservation, improvement and enjoyment of fish and wildlife resources. Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 transferred certain functions, including certain fish and wildlife-water resources coordination responsibilities, from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Commerce. Under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and Reorganization Plan No. 4, any federal agency that proposes to control or modify any body of water must first consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, and with the head of the appropriate state agency exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the affected state.

    (f) The Federal Power Act of 1920 (16 U.S.C. 791a ), as amended, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency (FERC) to issue licenses for the construction and the operation and maintenance of dams, water conduits, reservoirs, power houses, transmission lines, and other physical structures of a hydro-power project. However, where such structures will affect the navigable capacity of any navigable water of the United States (as defined in 16 U.S.C. 796), the plans for the dam or other physical structures affecting navigation must be approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army. In such cases, the interests of navigation should normally be protected by a DA recommendation to FERC for the inclusion of appropriate provisions in the FERC license rather than the issuance of a separate DA permit under 33 U.S.C. 401  As to any other activities in navigable waters not constituting construction and the operation and maintenance of physical structures licensed by FERC under the Federal Power Act of 1920, as amended, the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 401  remain fully applicable. In all cases involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters, section 404 or section 103 will be applicable.

    (g) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470) created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to advise the President and Congress on matters involving historic preservation. In performing its function the Council is authorized to review and comment upon activities licensed by the Federal Government which will have an effect upon properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or eligible for such listing. The concern of Congress for the preservation of significant historical sites is also expressed in the Preservation of Historical and Archeological Data Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469 ), which amends the Act of June 27, 1960. By this Act, whenever a federal construction project or federally licensed project, activity, or program alters any terrain such that significant historical or archeological data is threatened, the Secretary of the Interior may take action necessary to recover and preserve the data prior to the commencement of the project.

    (h) The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C. 1701 ) prohibits any developer or agent from selling or leasing any lot in a subdivision (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1701(3)) unless the purchaser is furnished in advance a printed property report containing information which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, by rules or regulations, require for the protection of purchasers. In the event the lot in question is part of a project that requires DA authorization, the property report is required by Housing and Urban Development regulation to state whether or not a permit for the development has been applied for, issued, or denied by the Corps of Engineers under section 10 or section 404. The property report is also required to state whether or not any enforcement action has been taken as a consequence of non-application for or denial of such permit.

    (i) The Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 ) declares the intention of the Congress to conserve threatened and endangered species and the ecosystems on which those species depend. The Act requires that federal agencies, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, use their authorities in furtherance of its purposes by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered or threatened species, and by taking such action necessary to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the Agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, as appropriate, to be critical. (See 50 CFR part 17 and 50 CFR part 402.)

    (j) The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 ) prohibits the ownership, construction, or operation of a deepwater port beyond the territorial seas without a license issued by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation may issue such a license to an applicant if he determines, among other things, that the construction and operation of the deepwater port is in the national interest and consistent with national security and other national policy goals and objectives. An application for a deepwater port license constitutes an application for all federal authorizations required for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port, including applications for section 10, section 404 and section 103 permits which may also be required pursuant to the authorities listed in § 320.2 and the policies specified in § 320.4 of this part.

    (k) The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 ) expresses the intent of Congress that marine mammals be protected and encouraged to develop in order to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. The Act imposes a perpetual moratorium on the harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals and on the importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products without a permit from either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, depending upon the species of marine mammal involved. Such permits may be issued only for purposes of scientific research and for public display if the purpose is consistent with the policies of the Act. The appropriate Secretary is also empowered in certain restricted circumstances to waive the requirements of the Act.

    (l) Section 7(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1278 ) provides that no department or agency of the United States shall assist by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such river was established, as determined by the Secretary charged with its administration.

    (m) The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980, (42 U.S.C. section 9101 ) establishes a licensing regime administered by the Administrator of NOAA for the ownership, construction, location, and operation of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) facilities and plantships. An application for an OTEC license filed with the Administrator constitutes an application for all federal authorizations required for ownership, construction, location, and operation of an OTEC facility or plantship, except for certain activities within the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard. This includes applications for section 10, section 404, section 103 and other DA authorizations which may be required.

    (n) Section 402 of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to issue permits under procedures established to implement the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. The administration of this program can be, and in most cases has been, delegated to individual states. Section 402(b)(6) states that no NPDES permit will be issued if the Chief of Engineers, acting for the Secretary of the Army and after consulting with the U.S. Coast Guard, determines that navigation and anchorage in any navigable water will be substantially impaired as a result of a proposed activity.

    (o) The National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-623) provides for the development of a National Artificial Reef Plan to promote and facilitate responsible and effective efforts to establish artificial reefs. The Act establishes procedures to be followed by the Corps in issuing DA permits for artificial reefs. The Act also establishes the liability of the permittee and the United States. The Act further creates a civil penalty for violation of any provision of a permit issued for an artificial reef.

    § 320.4   General policies for evaluating permit applications.

#### § § 320.4

    The following policies shall be applicable to the review of all applications for DA permits. Additional policies specifically applicable to certain types of activities are identified in 33 CFR parts 321 through 324.

    (a)  (1) The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity and its intended use on the public interest. Evaluation of the probable impact which the proposed activity may have on the public interest requires a careful weighing of all those factors which become relevant in each particular case. The benefits which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. The decision whether to authorize a proposal, and if so, the conditions under which it will be allowed to occur, are therefore determined by the outcome of this general balancing process. That decision should reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal must be considered including the cumulative effects thereof: among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people. For activities involving 404 discharges, a permit will be denied if the discharge that would be authorized by such permit would not comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's 404(b)(1) guidelines. Subject to the preceding sentence and any other applicable guidelines and criteria (see §§ 320.2 and 320.3), a permit will be granted unless the district engineer determines that it would be contrary to the public interest.

    (2) The following general criteria will be considered in the evaluation of every application:

    (i) The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed structure or work:

    (ii) Where there are unresolved conflicts as to resource use, the practicability of using reasonable alternative locations and methods to accomplish the objective of the proposed structure or work; and

    (iii) The extent and permanence of the beneficial and/or detrimental effects which the proposed structure or work is likely to have on the public and private uses to which the area is suited.

    (3) The specific weight of each factor is determined by its importance and relevance to the particular proposal. Accordingly, how important a factor is and how much consideration it deserves will vary with each proposal. A specific factor may be given great weight on one proposal, while it may not be present or as important on another. However, full consideration and appropriate weight will be given to all comments, including those of federal, state, and local agencies, and other experts on matters within their expertise.

    (b)  (1) Most wetlands constitute a productive and valuable public resource, the unnecessary alteration or destruction of which should be discouraged as contrary to the public interest. For projects to be undertaken or partially or entirely funded by a federal, state, or local agency, additional requirements on wetlands considerations are stated in Executive Order 11990, dated 24 May 1977.

    (2) Wetlands considered to perform functions important to the public interest include:

    (i) Wetlands which serve significant natural biological functions, including food chain production, general habitat and nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites for aquatic or land species;

    (ii) Wetlands set aside for study of the aquatic environment or as sanctuaries or refuges;

    (iii) Wetlands the destruction or alteration of which would affect detrimentally natural drainage characteristics, sedimentation patterns, salinity distribution, flushing characteristics, current patterns, or other environmental characteristics;

    (iv) Wetlands which are significant in shielding other areas from wave action, erosion, or storm damage. Such wetlands are often associated with barrier beaches, islands, reefs and bars;

    (v) Wetlands which serve as valuable storage areas for storm and flood waters;

    (vi) Wetlands which are ground water discharge areas that maintain minimum baseflows important to aquatic resources and those which are prime natural recharge areas;

    (vii) Wetlands which serve significant water purification functions; and

    (viii) Wetlands which are unique in nature or scarce in quantity to the region or local area.

    (3) Although a particular alteration of a wetland may constitute a minor change, the cumulative effect of numerous piecemeal changes can result in a major impairment of wetland resources. Thus, the particular wetland site for which an application is made will be evaluated with the recognition that it may be part of a complete and interrelated wetland area. In addition, the district engineer may undertake, where appropriate, reviews of particular wetland areas in consultation with the Regional Director of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Regional Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Regional Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the local representative of the Soil Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture, and the head of the appropriate state agency to assess the cumulative effect of activities in such areas.

    (4) No permit will be granted which involves the alteration of wetlands identified as important by paragraph (b)(2) of this section or because of provisions of paragraph (b)(3), of this section unless the district engineer concludes, on the basis of the analysis required in paragraph (a) of this section, that the benefits of the proposed alteration outweigh the damage to the wetlands resource. In evaluating whether a particular discharge activity should be permitted, the district engineer shall apply the section 404(b)(1) guidelines (40 CFR part 230.10(a) (1), (2), (3)).

    (5) In addition to the policies expressed in this subpart, the Congressional policy expressed in the Estuary Protection Act, Pub. L. 90-454, and state regulatory laws or programs for classification and protection of wetlands will be considered.

    (c)  In accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (paragraph 320.3(e) of this section) district engineers will consult with the Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Regional Director, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the head of the agency responsible for fish and wildlife for the state in which work is to be performed, with a view to the conservation of wildlife resources by prevention of their direct and indirect loss and damage due to the activity proposed in a permit application. The Army will give full consideration to the views of those agencies on fish and wildlife matters in deciding on the issuance, denial, or conditioning of individual or general permits.

    (d)  Applications for permits for activities which may adversely affect the quality of waters of the United States will be evaluated for compliance with applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards, during the construction and subsequent operation of the proposed activity. The evaluation should include the consideration of both point and non-point sources of pollution. It should be noted, however, that the Clean Water Act assigns responsibility for control of non-point sources of pollution to the states. Certification of compliance with applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards required under provisions of section 401 of the Clean Water Act will be considered conclusive with respect to water quality considerations unless the Regional Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), advises of other water quality aspects to be taken into consideration.

    (e)  Applications for DA permits may involve areas which possess recognized historic, cultural, scenic, conservation, recreational or similar values. Full evaluation of the general public interest requires that due consideration be given to the effect which the proposed structure or activity may have on values such as those associated with wild and scenic rivers, historic properties and National Landmarks, National Rivers, National Wilderness Areas, National Seashores, National Recreation Areas, National Lakeshores, National Parks, National Monuments, estuarine and marine sanctuaries, archeological resources, including Indian religious or cultural sites, and such other areas as may be established under federal or state law for similar and related purposes. Recognition of those values is often reflected by state, regional, or local land use classifications, or by similar federal controls or policies. Action on permit applications should, insofar as possible, be consistent with, and avoid significant adverse effects on the values or purposes for which those classifications, controls, or policies were established.

    (f)  Structures or work affecting coastal waters may modify the coast line or base line from which the territorial sea is measured for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act and international law. Generally, the coast line or base line is the line of ordinary low water on the mainland; however, there are exceptions where there are islands or lowtide elevations offshore (the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1301(a) and  v.  381 U.S.C. 139 (1965), 382 U.S. 448 (1966)). Applications for structures or work affecting coastal waters will therefore be reviewed specifically to determine whether the coast line or base line might be altered. If it is determined that such a change might occur, coordination with the Attorney General and the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior is required before final action is taken. The district engineer will submit a description of the proposed work and a copy of the plans to the Solicitor, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, and request his comments concerning the effects of the proposed work on the outer continental rights of the _United States_. These comments will be included in the administrative record of the application. After completion of standard processing procedures, the record will be forwarded to the Chief of Engineers. The decision on the application will be made by the Secretary of the Army after coordination with the Attorney General.

    (g)  Authorization of work or structures by DA does not convey a property right, nor authorize any injury to property or invasion of other rights.

    (1) An inherent aspect of property ownership is a right to reasonable private use. However, this right is subject to the rights and interests of the public in the navigable and other waters of the United States, including the federal navigation servitude and federal regulation for environmental protection.

    (2) Because a landowner has the general right to protect property from erosion, applications to erect protective structures will usually receive favorable consideration. However, if the protective structure may cause damage to the property of others, adversely affect public health and safety, adversely impact floodplain or wetland values, or otherwise appears contrary to the public interest, the district engineer will so advise the applicant and inform him of possible alternative methods of protecting his property. Such advice will be given in terms of general guidance only so as not to compete with private engineering firms nor require undue use of government resources.

    (3) A riparian landowner's general right of access to navigable waters of the United States is subject to the similar rights of access held by nearby riparian landowners and to the general public's right of navigation on the water surface. In the case of proposals which create undue interference with access to, or use of, navigable waters, the authorization will generally be denied.

    (4) Where it is found that the work for which a permit is desired is in navigable waters of the United States (see 33 CFR part 329) and may interfere with an authorized federal project, the applicant should be apprised in writing of the fact and of the possibility that a federal project which may be constructed in the vicinity of the proposed work might necessitate its removal or reconstruction. The applicant should also be informed that the United States will in no case be liable for any damage or injury to the structures or work authorized by Sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 or by section 404 of the Clean Water Act which may be caused by, or result from, future operations undertaken by the Government for the conservation or improvement of navigation or for other purposes, and no claims or right to compensation will accrue from any such damage.

    (5) Proposed activities in the area of a federal project which exists or is under construction will be evaluated to insure that they are compatible with the purposes of the project.

    (6) A DA permit does not convey any property rights, either in real estate or material, or any exclusive privileges. Furthermore, a DA permit does not authorize any injury to property or invasion of rights or any infringement of Federal, state or local laws or regulations. The applicant's signature on an application is an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application. The district engineer will not enter into disputes but will remind the applicant of the above. The dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the Corps public interest decision.

    (h)  Applications for DA permits for activities affecting the coastal zones of those states having a coastal zone management program approved by the Secretary of Commerce will be evaluated with respect to compliance with that program. No permit will be issued to a non-federal applicant until certification has been provided that the proposed activity complies with the coastal zone management program and the appropriate state agency has concurred with the certification or has waived its right to do so. However, a permit may be issued to a non-federal applicant if the Secretary of Commerce, on his own initiative or upon appeal by the applicant, finds that the proposed activity is consistent with the objectives of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security. Federal agency and Indian tribe applicants for DA permits are responsible for complying with the Coastal Zone Management Act's directives for assuring that their activities directly affecting the coastal zone are consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with approved state coastal zone management programs.

    (i)  Applications for DA authorization for activities in a marine sanctuary established by the Secretary of Commerce under authority of section 302 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, will be evaluated for impact on the marine sanctuary. No permit will be issued until the applicant provides a certification from the Secretary of Commerce that the proposed activity is consistent with the purposes of Title III of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, and can be carried out within the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce to control activities within the marine sanctuary.

    (j)  (1) Processing of an application for a DA permit normally will proceed concurrently with the processing of other required Federal, state, and/or local authorizations or certifications. Final action on the DA permit will normally not be delayed pending action by another Federal, state or local agency (See 33 CFR 325.2 (d)(4)). However, where the required Federal, state and/or local authorization and/or certification has been denied for activities which also require a Department of the Army permit before final action has been taken on the Army permit application, the district engineer will, after considering the likelihood of subsequent approval of the other authorization and/or certification and the time and effort remaining to complete processing the Army permit application, either immediately deny the Army permit without prejudice or continue processing the application to a conclusion. If the district engineer continues processing the application, he will conclude by either denying the permit as contrary to the public interest, or denying it without prejudice indicating that except for the other Federal, state or local denial the Army permit could, under appropriate conditions, be issued. Denial without prejudice means that there is no prejudice to the right of the applicant to reinstate processing of the Army permit application if subsequent approval is received from the appropriate Federal, state and/or local agency on a previously denied authorization and/or certification. Even if official certification and/or authorization is not required by state or federal law, but a state, regional, or local agency having jurisdiction or interest over the particular activity comments on the application, due consideration shall be given to those official views as a reflection of local factors of the public interest.

    (2) The primary responsibility for determining zoning and land use matters rests with state, local and tribal governments. The district engineer will normally accept decisions by such governments on those matters unless there are significant issues of overriding national importance. Such issues would include but are not necessarily limited to national security, navigation, national economic development, water quality, preservation of special aquatic areas, including wetlands, with significant interstate importance, and national energy needs. Whether a factor has overriding importance will depend on the degree of impact in an individual case.

    (3) A proposed activity may result in conflicting comments from several agencies within the same state. Where a state has not designated a single responsible coordinating agency, district engineers will ask the Governor to express his views or to designate one state agency to represent the official state position in the particular case.

    (4) In the absence of overriding national factors of the public interest that may be revealed during the evaluation of the permit application, a permit will generally be issued following receipt of a favorable state determination provided the concerns, policies, goals, and requirements as expressed in 33 CFR parts 320-324, and the applicable statutes have been considered and followed: e.g., the National Environmental Policy Act; the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; the Historical and Archeological Preservation Act; the National Historic Preservation Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Coastal Zone Management Act; the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended; the Clean Water Act, the Archeological Resources Act, and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. Similarly, a permit will generally be issued for Federal and Federally-authorized activities; another federal agency's determination to proceed is entitled to substantial consideration in the Corps' public interest review.

    (5) Where general permits to avoid duplication are not practical, district engineers shall develop joint procedures with those local, state, and other Federal agencies having ongoing permit programs for activities also regulated by the Department of the Army. In such cases, applications for DA permits may be processed jointly with the state or other federal applications to an independent conclusion and decision by the district engineer and the appropriate Federal or state agency. (See 33 CFR 325.2(e).)

    (6) The district engineer shall develop operating procedures for establishing official communications with Indian Tribes within the district. The procedures shall provide for appointment of a tribal representative who will receive all pertinent public notices, and respond to such notices with the official tribal position on the proposed activity. This procedure shall apply only to those tribes which accept this option. Any adopted operating procedures shall be distributed by public notice to inform the tribes of this option.

    (k)  To insure that all impoundment structures are designed for safety, non-Federal applicants may be required to demonstrate that the structures comply with established state dam safety criteria or have been designed by qualified persons and, in appropriate cases, that the design has been independently reviewed (and modified as the review would indicate) by similarly qualified persons.

    (l)  (1) Floodplains possess significant natural values and carry out numerous functions important to the public interest. These include:

    (i) Water resources values (natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and groundwater recharge);

    (ii) Living resource values (fish, wildlife, and plant resources);

    (iii) Cultural resource values (open space, natural beauty, scientific study, outdoor education, and recreation); and

    (iv) Cultivated resource values (agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry).

    (2) Although a particular alteration to a floodplain may constitute a minor change, the cumulative impact of such changes may result in a significant degradation of floodplain values and functions and in increased potential for harm to upstream and downstream activities. In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 11988, district engineers, as part of their public interest review, should avoid to the extent practicable, long and short term significant adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains, as well as the direct and indirect support of floodplain development whenever there is a practicable alternative. For those activities which in the public interest must occur in or impact upon floodplains, the district engineer shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the impacts of potential flooding on human health, safety, and welfare are minimized, the risks of flood losses are minimized, and, whenever practicable the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains are restored and preserved.

    (3) In accordance with Executive Order 11988, the district engineer should avoid authorizing floodplain developments whenever practicable alternatives exist outside the floodplain. If there are no such practicable alternatives, the district engineer shall consider, as a means of mitigation, alternatives within the floodplain which will lessen any significant adverse impact to the floodplain.

    (m)  Water is an essential resource, basic to human survival, economic growth, and the natural environment. Water conservation requires the efficient use of water resources in all actions which involve the significant use of water or that significantly affect the availability of water for alternative uses including opportunities to reduce demand and improve efficiency in order to minimize new supply requirements. Actions affecting water quantities are subject to Congressional policy as stated in section 101(g) of the Clean Water Act which provides that the authority of states to allocate water quantities shall not be superseded, abrogated, or otherwise impaired.

    (n)  Energy conservation and development are major national objectives. District engineers will give high priority to the processing of permit actions involving energy projects.

    (o)  (1) Section 11 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 authorized establishment of harbor lines shoreward of which no individual permits were required. Because harbor lines were established on the basis of navigation impacts only, the Corps of Engineers published a regulation on 27 May 1970 (33 CFR 209.150) which declared that permits would thereafter be required for activities shoreward of the harbor lines. Review of applications would be based on a full public interest evaluation and harbor lines would serve as guidance for assessing navigation impacts. Accordingly, activities constructed shoreward of harbor lines prior to 27 May 1970 do not require specific authorization.

    (2) The policy of considering harbor lines as guidance for assessing impacts on navigation continues.

    (3) Protection of navigation in all navigable waters of the United States continues to be a primary concern of the federal government.

    (4) District engineers should protect navigational and anchorage interests in connection with the NPDES program by recommending to EPA or to the state, if the program has been delegated, that a permit be denied unless appropriate conditions can be included to avoid any substantial impairment of navigation and anchorage.

    (p)  Some activities that require Department of the Army permits result in beneficial effects to the quality of the environment. The district engineer will weigh these benefits as well as environmental detriments along with other factors of the public interest.

    (q)  When private enterprise makes application for a permit, it will generally be assumed that appropriate economic evaluations have been completed, the proposal is economically viable, and is needed in the market place. However, the district engineer in appropriate cases, may make an independent review of the need for the project from the perspective of the overall public interest. The economic benefits of many projects are important to the local community and contribute to needed improvements in the local economic base, affecting such factors as employment, tax revenues, community cohesion, community services, and property values. Many projects also contribute to the National Economic Development (NED), (, the increase in the net value of the national output of goods and services).

    (r)   (1) Mitigation is an important aspect of the review and balancing process on many Department of the Army permit applications. Consideration of mitigation will occur throughout the permit application review process and includes avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, reducing, or compensating for resource losses. Losses will be avoided to the extent practicable. Compensation may occur on-site or at an off-site location. Mitigation requirements generally fall into three categories.

    (i) Project modifications to minimize adverse project impacts should be discussed with the applicant at pre-application meetings and during application processing. As a result of these discussions and as the district engineer's evaluation proceeds, the district engineer may require minor project modifications. Minor project modifications are those that are considered feasible (cost, constructability, etc.) to the applicant and that, if adopted, will result in a project that generally meets the applicant's purpose and need. Such modifications can include reductions in scope and size; changes in construction methods, materials or timing; and operation and maintenance practices or other similar modifications that reflect a sensitivity to environmental quality within the context of the work proposed. For example, erosion control features could be required on a fill project to reduce sedimentation impacts or a pier could be reoriented to minimize navigational problems even though those projects may satisfy all legal requirements (paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section) and the public interest review test (paragraph (r)(1)(iii) of this section) without such modifications.

    (ii) Further mitigation measures may be required to satisfy legal requirements. For Section 404 applications, mitigation shall be required to ensure that the project complies with the 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Some mitigation measures are enumerated at 40 CFR 230.70 through 40 CFR 230.77 (Subpart H of the 404(b)(1) Guidelines).

    (iii) Mitigation measures in addition to those under paragraphs (r)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section may be required as a result of the public interest review process. (See 33 CFR 325.4(a).) Mitigation should be developed and incorporated within the public interest review process to the extent that the mitigation is found by the district engineer to be reasonable and justified. Only those measures required to ensure that the project is not contrary to the public interest may be required under this subparagraph.

    (2) All compensatory mitigation will be for significant resource losses which are specifically identifiable, reasonably likely to occur, and of importance to the human or aquatic environment. Also, all mitigation will be directly related to the impacts of the proposal, appropriate to the scope and degree of those impacts, and reasonably enforceable. District engineers will require all forms of mitigation, including compensatory mitigation, only as provided in paragraphs (r)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section. Additional mitigation may be added at the applicants' request.

    § 321.1   General.

#### § § 321.1

    This regulation prescribes, in addition to the general policies of 33 CFR part 320 and procedures of 33 CFR part 325, those special policies, practices, and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers in connection with the review of applications for Department of the Army (DA) permits to authorize the construction of a dike or dam in a navigable water of the United States pursuant to section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401). See 33 CFR 320.2(a). Dams and dikes in navigable waters of the United States also require DA permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1344). Applicants for DA permits under this part should also refer to 33 CFR part 323 to satisfy the requirements of section 404.

    § 321.2   Definitions.

#### § § 321.2

    For the purpose of this regulation, the following terms are defined:

    (a) The term  means those waters of the United States that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to the mean high water mark and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible to use to transport interstate or foreign commerce. See 33 CFR part 329 for a more complete definition of this term.

    (b) The term  means, for the purposes of section 9, any impoundment structure that completely spans a navigable water of the United States and that may obstruct interstate waterborne commerce. The term does not include a weir. Weirs are regulated pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. (See 33 CFR part 322.)

    § 321.3   Special policies and procedures.

#### § § 321.3

    The following additional special policies and procedures shall be applicable to the evaluation of permit applications under this regulation:

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) will decide whether DA authorization for a dam or dike in an interstate navigable water of the United States will be issued, since this authority has not been delegated to the Chief of Engineers. The conditions to be imposed in any instrument of authorization will be recommended by the district engineer when forwarding the report to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), through the Chief of Engineers.

    (b) District engineers are authorized to decide whether DA authorization for a dam or dike in an intrastate navigable water of the United States will be issued (see 33 CFR 325.8).

    (c) Processing a DA application under section 9 will not be completed until the approval of the United States Congress has been obtained if the navigable water of the United States is an interstate waterbody, or until the approval of the appropriate state legislature has been obtained if the navigable water of the United States is an intrastate waterbody (, the navigable portion of the navigable water of the United States is solely within the boundaries of one state). The district engineer, upon receipt of such an application, will notify the applicant that the consent of Congress or the state legislature must be obtained before a permit can be issued.

### Part 322

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 403.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41228, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 322.1   General.

#### § § 322.1

    This regulation prescribes, in addition to the general policies of 33 CFR part 320 and procedures of 33 CFR part 325, those special policies, practices, and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers in connection with the review of applications for Department of the Army (DA) permits to authorize certain structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) (hereinafter referred to as section 10). See 33 CFR 320.2(b). Certain structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States are also regulated under other authorities of the DA. These include discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including the territorial seas, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344; see 33 CFR part 323) and the transportation of dredged material by vessel for purposes of dumping in ocean waters, including the territorial seas, pursuant to section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1413; see 33 CFR part 324). A DA permit will also be required under these additional authorities if they are applicable to structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States. Applicants for DA permits under this part should refer to the other cited authorities and implementing regulations for these additional permit requirements to determine whether they also are applicable to their proposed activities.

    § 322.2   Definitions.

#### § § 322.2

    For the purpose of this regulation, the following terms are defined:

    (a) The term  and all other terms relating to the geographic scope of jurisdiction are defined at 33 CFR part 329. Generally, they are those waters of the United States that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to the mean high water mark, and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible to use to transport interstate or foreign commerce.

    (b) The term  shall include, without limitation, any pier, boat dock, boat ramp, wharf, dolphin, weir, boom, breakwater, bulkhead, revetment, riprap, jetty, artificial island, artificial reef, permanent mooring _structure_, power transmission line, permanently moored floating vessel, piling, aid to navigation, or any other obstacle or obstruction.

    (c) The term  shall include, without limitation, any dredging or disposal of dredged material, excavation, filling, or other modification of a navigable water of the United States.

    (d) The term  means a type of individual permit issued in accordance with the abbreviated procedures of 33 CFR 325.2(e).

    (e) The term  means a DA authorization that is issued following a case-by-case evaluation of a specific structure or work in accordance with the procedures of this regulation and 33 CFR part 325, and a determination that the proposed structure or work is in the public interest pursuant to 33 CFR part 320.

    (f) The term  means a DA authorization that is issued on a nationwide or regional basis for a category or categories of activities when:

    (1) Those activities are substantially similar in nature and cause only minimal individual and cumulative environmental impacts; or

    (2) The general permit would result in avoiding unnecessary duplication of the regulatory control exercised by another Federal, state, or local agency provided it has been determined that the environmental consequences of the action are individually and cumulatively minimal. (See 33 CFR 325.2(e) and 33 CFR part 330.)

    (g) The term  means a structure which is constructed or placed in the navigable waters of the United States or in the waters overlying the outer continental shelf for the purpose of enhancing fishery resources and commercial and recreational fishing opportunities. The term does not include activities or structures such as wing deflectors, bank stabilization, grade stabilization structures, or low flow key ways, all of which may be useful to enhance fisheries resources.

    § 322.3   Activities requiring permits.

#### § § 322.3

    (a)  DA permits are required under section 10 for structures and/or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States except as otherwise provided in § 322.4 below. Certain activities specified in 33 CFR part 330 are permitted by that regulation (”nationwide general permits”). Other activities may be authorized by district or division engineers on a regional basis (“regional general permits”). If an activity is not exempted by section 322.4 of this part or authorized by a general permit, an individual section 10 permit will be required for the proposed activity. Structures or work are in navigable waters of the United States if they are within limits defined in 33 CFR part 329. Structures or work outside these limits are subject to the provisions of law cited in paragraph (a) of this section, if these structures or work affect the course, location, or condition of the waterbody in such a manner as to impact on its navigable capacity. For purposes of a section 10 permit, a tunnel or other structure or work under or over a navigable water of the United States is considered to have an impact on the navigable capacity of the waterbody.

    (b)  DA permits are required for the construction of artificial islands, installations, and other devices on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the outer continental shelf, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act as amended. (See 33 CFR 320.2(b).)

    (c)  (1) Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, activities of the type described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, done by or on behalf of any Federal agency are subject to the authorization procedures of these regulations. Work or structures in or affecting navigable waters of the United States that are part of the civil works activities of the Corps of Engineers, unless covered by a nationwide or regional general permit issued pursuant to these regulations, are subject to the procedures of separate regulations. Agreement for construction or engineering services performed for other agencies by the Corps of Engineers does not constitute authorization under this regulation. Division and district engineers will therefore advise Federal agencies accordingly, and cooperate to the fullest extent in expediting the processing of their applications.

    (2) Congress has delegated to the Secretary of the Army in section 10 the duty to authorize or prohibit certain work or structures in navigable waters of the United States, upon recommendation of the Chief of Engineers. The general legislation by which Federal agencies are enpowered to act generally is not considered to be sufficient authorization by Congress to satisfy the purposes of section 10. If an agency asserts that it has Congressional authorization meeting the test of section 10 or would otherwise be exempt from the provisions of section 10, the legislative history and/or provisions of the Act should clearly demonstrate that Congress was approving the exact location and plans from which Congress could have considered the effect on navigable waters of the United States or that Congress intended to exempt that agency from the requirements of section 10. Very often such legislation reserves final approval of plans or construction for the Chief of Engineers. In such cases evaluation and authorization under this regulation are limited by the intent of the statutory language involved.

    (3) The policy provisions set out in 33 CFR 320.4(j) relating to state or local certifications and/or authorizations, do not apply to work or structures undertaken by Federal agencies, except where compliance with non-Federal authorization is required by Federal law or Executive policy, e.g., section 313 and section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

    § 322.4   Activities not requiring permits.

#### § § 322.4

    (a) Activities that were commenced or completed shoreward of established Federal harbor lines before May 27, 1970 (see 33 CFR 320.4(o)) do not require section 10 permits; however, if those activities involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States after October 18, 1972, a section 404 permit is required. (See 33 CFR part 323.)

    (b) Pursuant to section 154 of the Water Resource Development Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-587), Department of the Army permits are not required under section 10 to construct wharves and piers in any waterbody, located entirely within one state, that is a navigable water of the United States solely on the basis of its historical use to transport interstate commerce.

    § 322.5   Special policies.

#### § § 322.5

    The Secretary of the Army has delegated to the Chief of Engineers the authority to issue or deny section 10 permits. The following additional special policies and procedures shall also be applicable to the evaluation of permit applications under this regulation.

    (a)  DA permits are required for structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States. However, certain structures or work specified in 33 CFR part 330 are permitted by that regulation. If a structure or work is not permitted by that regulation, an individual or regional section 10 permit will be required.

    (b)  (1) When considering an application for an artificial reef, as defined in 33 CFR 322.2(g), the district engineer will review the applicant's provisions for siting, constructing, monitoring, operating, maintaining, and managing the proposed artificial reef and shall determine if those provisions are consistent with the following standards:

    (i) The enhancement of fishery resources to the maximum extent practicable;

    (ii) The facilitation of access and utilization by United States recreational and commercial fishermen;

    (iii) The minimization of conflicts among competing uses of the navigable waters or waters overlying the outer continental shelf and of the resources in such waters;

    (iv) The minimization of environmental risks and risks to personal health and property;

    (v) Generally accepted principles of international law; and

    (vi) the prevention of any unreasonable obstructions to navigation. If the district engineer decides that the applicant's provisions are not consistent with these standards, he shall deny the permit. If the district engineer decides that the provisions are consistent with these standards, and if he decides to issue the permit after the public interest review, he shall make the provisions part of the permit.

    (2) In addition, the district engineer will consider the National Artificial Reef Plan developed pursuant to section 204 of the National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984, and if he decides to issue the permit, will notify the Secretary of Commerce of any need to deviate from that plan.

    (3) The district engineer will comply with all coordination provisions required by a written agreement between the DOD and the Federal agencies relative to artificial reefs. In addition, if the district engineer decides that further consultation beyond the normal public commenting process is required to evaluate fully the proposed artificial reef, he may initiate such consultation with any Federal agency, state or local government, or other interested party.

    (4) The district engineer will issue a permit for the proposed artificial reef only if the applicant demonstrates, to the district engineer's satisfaction, that the title to the artificial reef construction material is unambiguous, that responsibility for maintenance of the reef is clearly established, and that he has the financial ability to assume liability for all damages that may arise with respect to the proposed artificial reef. A demonstration of financial responsibility might include evidence of insurance, sponsorship, or available assets.

    (i) A person to whom a permit is issued in accordance with these regulations and any insurer of that person shall not be liable for damages caused by activities required to be undertaken under any terms and conditions of the permit, if the permittee is in compliance with such terms and conditions.

    (ii) A person to whom a permit is issued in accordance with these regulations and any insurer of that person shall be liable, to the extent determined under applicable law, for damages to which paragraph (i) does not apply.

    (iii) Any person who has transferred title to artificial reef construction materials to a person to whom a permit is issued in accordance with these regulations shall not be liable for damages arising from the use of such materials in an artificial reef, if such materials meet applicable requirements of the plan published under section 204 of the National Artificial Reef Plan, and are not otherwise defective at the time title is transferred.

    (c)  (1) The benefits which an authorized Federal navigation project are intended to produce will often require similar and related operations by non-Federal agencies (e.g., dredging access channels to docks and berthing facilities or deepening such channels to correspond to the Federal project depth). These non-Federal activities will be considered by Corps of Engineers officials in planning the construction and maintenance of Federal navigation projects and, to the maximum practical extent, will be coordinated with interested Federal, state, regional and local agencies and the general public simultaneously with the associated Federal projects. Non-Federal activities which are not so coordinated will be individually evaluated in accordance with these regulations. In evaluating the public interest in connection with applications for permits for such coordinated operations, equal treatment will be accorded to the fullest extent possible to both Federal and non-Federal operations. Permits for non-Federal dredging operations will normally contain conditions requiring the permittee to comply with the same practices or requirements utilized in connection with related Federal dredging operations with respect to such matters as turbidity, water quality, containment of material, nature and location of approved spoil disposal areas (non-Federal use of Federal contained disposal areas will be in accordance with laws authorizing such areas and regulations governing their use), extent and period of dredging, and other factors relating to protection of environmental and ecological values.

    (2) A permit for the dredging of a channel, slip, or other such project for navigation may also authorize the periodic maintenance dredging of the project. Authorization procedures and limitations for maintenance dredging shall be as prescribed in 33 CFR 325.6(e). The permit will require the permittee to give advance notice to the district engineer each time maintenance dredging is to be performed. Where the maintenance dredging involves the discharge of dredged material into waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters, the procedures in 33 CFR parts 323 and 324 respectively shall also be followed.

    (d)  (1) In the absence of overriding public interest, favorable consideration will generally be given to applications from riparian owners for permits for piers, boat docks, moorings, platforms and similar structures for small boats. Particular attention will be given to the location and general design of such structures to prevent possible obstructions to navigation with respect to both the public's use of the waterway and the neighboring proprietors' access to the waterway. Obstructions can result from both the existence of the structure, particularly in conjunction with other similar facilities in the immediate vicinity, and from its inability to withstand wave action or other forces which can be expected. District engineers will inform applicants of the hazards involved and encourage safety in location, design, and operation. District engineers will encourage cooperative or group use facilities in lieu of individual proprietary use facilities.

    (2) Floating structures for small recreational boats or other recreational purposes in lakes controlled by the Corps of Engineers under a resource manager are normally subject to permit authorities cited in § 322.3, of this section, when those waters are regarded as navigable waters of the United States. However, such structures will not be authorized under this regulation but will be regulated under applicable regulations of the Chief of Engineers published in 36 CFR 327.19 if the land surrounding those lakes is under complete Federal ownership. District engineers will delineate those portions of the navigable waters of the United States where this provision is applicable and post notices of this designation in the vicinity of the lake resource manager's office.

    (e)  The placing of fixed and floating aids to navigation in a navigable water of the United States is within the purview of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Furthermore, these aids are of particular interest to the U.S. Coast Guard because of its control of marking, lighting and standardization of such navigation aids. A Section 10 nationwide permit has been issued for such aids provided they are approved by, and installed in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 330.5(a)(1)). Electrical service cables to such aids are not included in the nationwide permit (an individual or regional Section 10 permit will be required).

    (f)  Artificial islands, installations, and other devices located on the seabed, to the seaward limit of the outer continental shelf, are subject to the standard permit procedures of this regulation. Where the islands, installations and other devices are to be constructed on lands which are under mineral lease from the Mineral Management Service, Department of the Interior, that agency, in cooperation with other federal agencies, fully evaluates the potential effect of the leasing program on the total environment. Accordingly, the decision whether to issue a permit on lands which are under mineral lease from the Department of the Interior will be limited to an evaluation of the impact of the proposed work on navigation and national security. The public notice will so identify the criteria.

    (g)  A canal or similar artificial waterway is subject to the regulatory authorities discussed in § 322.3, of this part, if it constitutes a navigable water of the United States, or if it is connected to navigable waters of the United States in a manner which affects their course, location, condition, or capacity, or if at some point in its construction or operation it results in an effect on the course, location, condition, or capacity of navigable waters of the United States. In all cases the connection to navigable waters of the United States requires a permit. Where the canal itself constitutes a navigable water of the United States, evaluation of the permit application and further exercise of regulatory authority will be in accordance with the standard procedures of these regulations. For all other canals, the exercise of regulatory authority is restricted to those activities which affect the course, location, condition, or capacity of the navigable waters of the United States. The district engineer will consider, for applications for canal work, a proposed plan of the entire development and the location and description of anticipated docks, piers and other similar structures which will be placed in the canal.

    (h)  (1) The construction, operation, maintenance, or connection of facilities at the borders of the United States are subject to Executive control and must be authorized by the President, Secretary of State, or other delegated official.

    (2) Applications for permits for the construction, operation, maintenance, or connection at the borders of the United States of facilities for the transmission of electric energy between the United States and a foreign country, or for the exportation or importation of natural gas to or from a foreign country, must be made to the Secretary of Energy. (Executive Order 10485, September 3, 1953, 16 U.S.C. 824(a)(e), 15 U.S.C. 717(b), as amended by Executive Order 12038, February 3, 1978, and 18 CFR parts 32 and 153).

    (3) Applications for the landing or operation of submarine cables must be made to the Federal Communications Commission. (Executive Order 10530, May 10, 1954, 47 U.S.C. 34 to 39, and 47 CFR 1.766).

    (4) The Secretary of State is to receive applications for permits for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance, at the borders of the United States, of pipelines, conveyor belts, and similar facilities for the exportation or importation of petroleum products, coals, minerals, or other products to or from a foreign country; facilities for the exportation or importation of water or sewage to or from a foreign country; and monorails, aerial cable cars, aerial tramways, and similar facilities for the transportation of persons and/or things, to or from a foreign country. (Executive Order 11423, August 16, 1968).

    (5) A DA permit under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 is also required for all of the above facilities which affect the navigable waters of the United States, but in each case in which a permit has been issued as provided above, the district engineer, in evaluating the general public interest, may consider the basic existence and operation of the facility to have been primarily examined and permitted as provided by the Executive Orders. Furthermore, in those cases where the construction, maintenance, or operation at the above facilities involves the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters, appropriate DA authorizations under section 404 of the Clean Water Act or under section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, are also required. (See 33 CFR parts 323 and 324.)

    (i)  (1) Permits under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 are required for power transmission lines crossing navigable waters of the United States unless those lines are part of a water power project subject to the regulatory authorities of the Department of Energy under the Federal Power Act of 1920. If an application is received for a permit for lines which are part of such a water power project, the applicant will be instructed to submit the application to the Department of Energy. If the lines are not part of such a water power project, the application will be processed in accordance with the procedures of these regulations.

    (2) The following minimum clearances are required for aerial electric power transmission lines crossing navigable waters of the United States. These clearances are related to the clearances over the navigable channel provided by existing fixed bridges, or the clearances which would be required by the U.S. Coast Guard for new fixed bridges, in the vicinity of the proposed power line crossing. The clearances are based on the low point of the line under conditions which produce the greatest sag, taking into consideration temperature, load, wind, length or span, and type of supports as outlined in the National Electrical Safety Code.

    (3) Clearances for communication lines, stream gaging cables, ferry cables, and other aerial crossings are usually required to be a minimum of ten feet above clearances required for bridges. Greater clearances will be required if the public interest so indicates.

    (4) Corps of Engineer regulation ER 1110-2-4401 prescribes minimum vertical clearances for power and communication lines over Corps lake projects. In instances where both this regulation and ER 1110-2-4401 apply, the greater minimum clearance is required.

    (j)  (1) Structures in navigable waters of the United States associated with seaplane operations require DA permits, but close coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation, is required on such applications.

    (2) The FAA must be notified by an applicant whenever he proposes to establish or operate a seaplane base. The FAA will study the proposal and advise the applicant, district engineer, and other interested parties as to the effects of the proposal on the use of airspace. The district engineer will, therefore, refer any objections regarding the effect of the proposal on the use of airspace to the FAA, and give due consideration to its recommendations when evaluating the general public interest.

    (3) If the seaplane base would serve air carriers licensed by the Department of Transportation, the applicant must receive an airport operating certificate from the FAA. That certificate reflects a determination and conditions relating to the installation, operation, and maintenance of adequate air navigation facilities and safety equipment. Accordingly, the district engineer may, in evaluating the general public interest, consider such matters to have been primarily evaluated by the FAA.

    (4) For regulations pertaining to seaplane landings at Corps of Engineers projects, see 36 CFR 327.4.

    (k)  The Foreign Trade Zones Act (48 Stat. 998-1003, 19 U.S.C. 81a to 81u, as amended) authorizes the establishment of foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to United States ports of entry under terms of a grant and regulations prescribed by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. Pertinent regulations are published at Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 400. The Secretary of the Army is a member of the Board, and construction of a zone is under the supervision of the district engineer. Laws governing the navigable waters of the United States remain applicable to foreign-trade zones, including the general requirements of these regulations. Evaluation by a district engineer of a permit application may give recognition to the consideration by the Board of the general economic effects of the zone on local and foreign commerce, general location of wharves and facilities, and other factors pertinent to construction, operation, and maintenance of the zone.

    (l)  DA permits are required for structures located within shipping safety fairways and anchorage areas established by the U.S. Coast Guard.

    (1) The Department of the Army will grant no permits for the erection of structures in areas designated as fairways, except that district engineers may permit anchors and attendant cables or chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs to be placed within a fairway provided the following conditions are met:

    (i) The purpose of such anchors and attendant cables or chains as used in this section is to stabilize floating production facilities or semisubmersible drilling rigs which are located outside the boundaries of the fairway.

    (ii) In water depths of 600 feet or less, the installation of anchors and attendant cables or chains within fairways must be temporary and shall be allowed to remain only 120 days. This period may be extended by the district engineer provided reasonable cause for such extension can be shown and the extension is otherwise justified. In water depths greater than 600 feet, time restrictions on anchors and attendant cables or chains located within a fairway, whether temporary or permanent, shall not apply.

    (iii) Drilling rigs must be at least 500 feet from any fairway boundary or whatever distance necessary to insure that minimum clearance over an anchor line within a fairway will be 125 feet.

    (iv) No anchor buoys or floats or related rigging will be allowed on the surface of the water or to a depth of 125 feet from the surface, within the fairway.

    (v) Drilling rigs may not be placed closer than 2 nautical miles of any other drilling rig situated along a fairway boundary, and not closer than 3 nautical miles to any drilling rig located on the opposite side of the fairway.

    (vi) The permittee must notify the district engineer, Bureau of Land Management, Mineral Management Service, U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office of the approximate dates (commencement and completion) the anchors will be in place to insure maximum notification to mariners.

    (vii) Navigation aids or danger markings must be installed as required by the U.S. Coast Guard.

    (2) District engineers may grant permits for the erection of structures within an area designated as an anchorage area, but the number of structures will be limited by spacing, as follows: The center of a structure to be erected shall be not less than two (2) nautical miles from the center of any existing structure. In a drilling or production complex, associated structures shall be as close together as practicable having due consideration for the safety factors involved. A complex of associated structures, when connected by walkways, shall be considered one structure for the purpose of spacing. A vessel fixed in place by moorings and used in conjunction with the associated structures of a drilling or production complex, shall be considered an attendant vessel and its extent shall include its moorings. When a drilling or production complex includes an attendant vessel and the complex extends more than five hundred (500) yards from the center or the complex, a structure to be erected shall be not closer than two (2) nautical miles from the near outer limit of the complex. An underwater completion installation in and anchorage area shall be considered a structure and shall be marked with a lighted buoy as approved by the United States Coast Guard.

  PART 323—PERMITS FOR DISCHARGES OF DREDGED OR FILL MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Part 323

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1344.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41232, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 323.1   General.

#### § § 323.1

    This regulation prescribes, in addition to the general policies of 33 CFR part 320 and procedures of 33 CFR part 325, those special policies, practices, and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers in connection with the review of applications for DA permits to authorize the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 U.S.C. 1344) (hereinafter referred to as section 404). (See 33 CFR 320.2(g).) Certain discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States are also regulated under other authorities of the Department of the Army. These include dams and dikes in navigable waters of the United States pursuant to section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401; see 33 CFR part 321) and certain structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403; see 33 CFR part 322). A DA permit will also be required under these additional authorities if they are applicable to activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Applicants for DA permits under this part should refer to the other cited authorities and implementing regulations for these additional permit requirements to determine whether they also are applicable to their proposed activities.

    § 323.2   Definitions.

#### § § 323.2

    For the purpose of this part, the following terms are defined:

    (a) The term  and all other terms relating to the geographic scope of jurisdiction are defined at 33 CFR part 328.

    (b) The term  means a standing body of open water that occurs in a natural depression fed by one or more streams from which a stream may flow, that occurs due to the widening or natural blockage or cutoff of a river or stream, or that occurs in an isolated natural depression that is not a part of a surface river or stream. The term also includes a standing body of open water created by artificially blocking or restricting the flow of a river, stream, or tidal area. As used in this regulation, the term does not include artificial _lake_s or ponds created by excavating and/or diking dry land to collect and retain water for such purposes as stock watering, irrigation, settling basins, cooling, or rice growing.

    (c) The term  means material that is excavated or dredged from waters of the United States.

    (d)(1) Except as provided below in paragraph (d)(2), the term  means any addition of dredged material into, including redeposit of dredged material other than incidential fallback within, the waters of the United States. The term includes, but is not limited to, the following:

    (i) The addition of dredged material to a specified discharge site located in waters of the United States;

    (ii) The runoff or overflow from a contained land or water disposal area; and

    (iii) Any addition, including redeposit other than incidential fallback, of dredged material, including excavated material, into waters of the United States which is incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation.

    (2) The term  does not include the following:

    (i) Discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States resulting from the onshore subsequent processing of dredged material that is extracted for any commercial use (other than fill). These discharges are subject to section 402 of the Clean Water Act even though the extraction and deposit of such material may require a permit from the Corps or applicable State section 404 program.

    (ii) Activities that involve only the cutting or removing of vegetation above the ground (e.g., mowing, rotary cutting, and chainsawing) where the activity neither substantially disturbs the root system nor involves mechanized pushing, dragging, or other similar activities that redeposit excavated soil material.

    (iii) Incidental fallback.

    (3) Section 404 authorization is not required for the following:

    (i) Any incidental addition, including redeposit, of dredged material associated with any activity that does not have or would not have the effect of destroying or degrading an area of waters of the United States as defined in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section; however, this exception does not apply to any person preparing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization and other excavation activity in a water of the United States, which would result in a redeposit of dredged material, unless the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, prior to commencing the activity involving the discharge, that the activity would not have the effect of destroying or degrading any area of waters of the United States, as defined in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section. The person proposing to undertake mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or other excavation activity bears the burden of demonstrating that such activity would not destroy or degrade any area of waters of the United States.

    (ii) Incidental movement of dredged material occurring during normal dredging operations, defined as dredging for navigation in  as that term is defined in part 329 of this chapter, with proper authorization from the Congress and/or the Corps pursuant to part 322 of this Chapter; however, this exception is not applicable to dredging activities in wetlands, as that term is defined at section 328.3 of this Chapter.

    (iii) Certain discharges, such as those associated with normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities, are not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under section 404. See 33 CFR 323.4 for discharges that do not required permits.

    (4) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material destroys an area of waters of the United States if it alters the area in such a way that it would no longer be a water of the United States.

    (5) For purposes of this section, an activity associated with a discharge of dredged material degrades an area of waters of the United States if it has more than a  (, inconsequential) effect on the area by causing an identifiable individual or cumulative adverse effect on any aquatic function.

    (e)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the term fill material means material placed in waters of the United States where the material has the effect of:

    (i) Replacing any portion of a water of the United States with dry land; or

    (ii) Changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a water of the United States.

    (2) Examples of such fill material include, but are not limited to: rock, sand, soil, clay, plastics, construction debris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other excavation activities, and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure in the waters of the United States.

    (3) The term fill material does not include trash or garbage.

    (f) The term  means the addition of fill material into waters of the United States. The term generally includes, without limitation, the following activities: Placement of fill that is necessary for the construction of any structure or infrastructure in a water of the United States; the building of any structure, infrastructure, or impoundment requiring rock, sand, dirt, or other material for its construction; site-development fills for recreational, industrial, commercial, residential, or other uses; causeways or road fills; dams and dikes; artificial islands; property protection and/or reclamation devices such as riprap, groins, seawalls, breakwaters, and revetments; beach nourishment; levees; fill for structures such as sewage treatment facilities, intake and outfall pipes associated with power plants and subaqueous utility lines; placement of fill material for construction or maintenance of any liner, berm, or other infrastructure associated with solid waste landfills; placement of overburden, slurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials; and artificial reefs. The term does not include plowing, cultivating, seeding and harvesting for the production of food, fiber, and forest products (See § 323.4 for the definition of these terms). See § 323.3(c) concerning the regulation of the placement of pilings in waters of the United States.

    (g) The term  means a Department of the Army authorization that is issued following a case-by-case evaluation of a specific project involving the proposed discharge(s) in accordance with the procedures of this part and 33 CFR part 325 and a determination that the proposed discharge is in the public interest pursuant to 33 CFR part 320.

    (h) The term  means a Department of the Army authorization that is issued on a nationwide or regional basis for a category or categories of activities when:

    (1) Those activities are substantially similar in nature and cause only minimal individual and cumulative environmental impacts; or

    (2) The general permit would result in avoiding unnecessary duplication of regulatory control exercised by another Federal, State, or local agency provided it has been determined that the environmental consequences of the action are individually and cumulatively minimal. (See 33 CFR 325.2(e) and 33 CFR part 330.)

    § 323.3   Discharges requiring permits.

#### § § 323.3

    (a)  Except as provided in § 323.4 of this part, DA permits will be required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Certain discharges specified in 33 CFR part 330 are permitted by that regulation (“nationwide permits”). Other discharges may be authorized by district or division engineers on a regional basis (“regional permits”). If a discharge of dredged or fill material is not exempted by § 323.4 of this part or permitted by 33 CFR part 330, an individual or regional section 404 permit will be required for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States.

    (b)  Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States done by or on behalf of any Federal agency, other than the Corps of Engineers (see 33 CFR 209.145), are subject to the authorization procedures of these regulations. Agreement for construction or engineering services performed for other agencies by the Corps of Engineers does not constitute authorization under the regulations. Division and district engineers will therefore advise Federal agencies and instrumentalities accordingly and cooperate to the fullest extent in expediting the processing of their applications.

    (c)  (1) Placement of pilings in waters of the United States constitutes a discharge of fill material and requires a section 404 permit when such placement has or would have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Examples of such activities that have the effect of a discharge of fill material include, but are not limited to, the following: Projects where the pilings are so closely spaced that sedimentation rates would be increased; projects in which the pilings themselves effectively would replace the bottom of a waterbody; projects involving the placement of pilings that would reduce the reach or impair the flow or circulation of waters of the United States; and projects involving the placement of pilings which would result in the adverse alteration or elimination of aquatic functions.

    (2) Placement of pilings in waters of the United States that does not have or would not have the effect of a discharge of fill material shall not require a section 404 permit. Placement of pilings for linear projects, such as bridges, elevated walkways, and powerline structures, generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. Furthermore, placement of pilings in waters of the United States for piers, wharves, and an individual house on stilts generally does not have the effect of a discharge of fill material. All pilings, however, placed in the  as that term is defined in part 329 of this chapter, require authorization under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (see part 322 of this chapter).

    § 323.4   Discharges not requiring permits.

#### § § 323.4

    (a)  Except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, any discharge of dredged or fill material that may result from any of the following activities is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under section 404:

    (1)(i) Normal farming, silviculture and ranching activities such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, and harvesting for the production of food, fiber, and forest products, or upland soil and water conservation practices, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

    (ii) To fall under this exemption, the activities specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be part of an established (, on-going) farming, silviculture, or ranching operation and must be in accordance with definitions in § 323.4(a)(1)(iii). Activities on areas lying fallow as part of a conventional rotational cycle are part of an established operation. Activities which bring an area into farming, silviculture, or ranching use are not part of an established operation. An operation ceases to be established when the area on which it was conducted has been converted to another use or has lain idle so long that modifications to the hydrological regime are necessary to resume operations. If an activity takes place outside the waters of the United States, or if it does not involve a discharge, it does not need a section 404 permit, whether or not it is part of an established farming, silviculture, or ranching operation.

    (iii)(A)  means physical methods of soil treatment employed within established farming, ranching and silviculture lands on farm, ranch, or forest crops to aid and improve their growth, quality or yield.

    (B)  means physical measures employed directly upon farm, forest, or ranch crops within established agricultural and silvicultural lands to bring about their removal from farm, forest, or ranch land, but does not include the construction of farm, forest, or ranch roads.

    (C)()  means:

    () The d_i_scharge of dredged or fill material incidental to connecting upland drainage facilities to waters of the United States, adequate to effect the removal of excess soil moisture from upland croplands. (Construction and maintenance of upland (dryland) facilities, such as ditching and tiling, incidental to the planting, cultivating, protecting, or harvesting of crops, involve no discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, and as such never require a section 404 permit.);

    () The discharge of dredged or fill material for the purpose of installing ditching or other such water control facilities incidental to planting, cultivating, protecting, or harvesting of rice, cranberries or other wetland crop species, where these activities and the discharge occur in waters of the United States which are in established use for such agricultural and silvicultural wetland crop production;

    () The discharge of dredged or fill material for the purpose of manipulating the water levels of, or regulating the flow or distribution of water within, existing impoundments which have been constructed in accordance with applicable requirements of CWA, and which are in established use for the production of rice, cranberries, or other wetland crop species. (The provisions of paragraphs (a)(_1_)(__ii_i_)(C)() () and () of this section apply to areas that are in established use exclusively for wetland crop production as well as areas in established use for conventional wetland/non-wetland crop rotation (e.g., the rotations of rice and soybeans) where such rotation results in the cyclical or intermittent temporary dewatering of such areas.)

    () The discharges of dredged or fill material incidental to the emergency removal of sandbars, gravel bars, or other similar blockages which are formed during flood flows or other events, where such blockages close or constrict previously existing drainageways and, if not promptly removed, would result in damage to or loss of existing crops or would impair or prevent the plowing, seeding, harvesting or cult_iv_ating of crops on land in established use for crop production. Such removal does not include enlarging or extending the dimensions of, or changing the bottom elevations of, the affected drainageway as it existed prior to the formation of the blockage. Removal must be accomplished within one year of discovery of such blockages in order to be eligible for exemption.

    () Minor drainage in waters of the U.S. is limited to drainage within areas that are part of an established farming or silviculture operation. It does not include drainage associated with the immediate or gradual conversion of a wetland to a non-wetland (e.g., wetland species to upland species not typically adapted to life in saturated soil conditions), or conversion from one wetland use to another (for example, silviculture to farming). In addition, minor drainage does not include the construction of any canal, ditch, dike or other waterway or structure which drains or otherwise significantly modifies a stream, lake, swamp, bog or any other wetland or aquatic area constituting waters of the United States. Any discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States incidental to the construction of any such structure or waterway requires a permit.

    (D)  means all forms of primary tillage, including moldboard, chisel, or wide-blade plowing, discing, harrowing and similar physical means utilized on farm, forest or ranch land for the breaking up, cutting, turning over, or stirring of soil to prepare it for the planting of crops. The term does not include the redistribution of soil, rock, sand, or other surficial materials in a manner which changes any area of the waters of the United States to dry land. For example, the redistribution of surface materials by blading, grading, or other means to fill in wetland areas is not plowing. Rock crushing activities which result in the loss of natural drainage characteristics, the reduction of water storage and recharge capabilities, or the overburden of natural water filtration capacities do not constitute plowing. _Plowing_ as described above will never involve a discharge of dredged or fill material.

    (E)  means the sowing of seed and placement of seedlings to produce farm, ranch, or forest crops and includes the placement of soil beds for seeds or seedlings on established farm and forest lands.

    (2) Maintenance, including emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts, of currently serviceable structures such as dikes, dams, levees, groins, riprap, breakwaters, causeways, bridge abutments or approaches, and transportation structures. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope, or size of the original fill design. Emergency reconstruction must occur within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs in order to qualify for this exemption.

    (3) Construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance (but not construction) of drainage ditches. Discharges associated with siphons, pumps, headgates, wingwalls, weirs, diversion structures, and such other facilities as are appurtenant and functionally related to irrigation ditches are included in this exemption.

    (4) Construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction site which does not include placement of fill material into waters of the U.S. The term “construction site” refers to any site involving the erection of buildings, roads, and other discrete structures and the installation of support facilities necessary for construction and utilization of such structures. The term also includes any other land areas which involve land-disturbing excavation activities, including quarrying or other mining activities, where an increase in the runoff of sediment is controlled through the use of temporary sedimentation basins.

    (5) Any activity with respect to which a State has an approved program under section 208(b)(4) of the CWA which meets the requirements of sections 208(b)(4) (B) and (C).

    (6) Construction or maintenance of farm roads, forest roads, or temporary roads for moving mining equipment, where such roads are constructed and maintained in accordance with best management practices (BMPs) to assure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of waters of the United States are not impaired, that the reach of the waters of the United States is not reduced, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be otherwise minimized. These BMPs which must be applied to satisfy this provision shall include those detailed BMPs described in the State's approved program description pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 233.22(i), and shall also include the following baseline provisions:

    (i) Permanent roads (for farming or forestry activities), temporary access roads (for mining, forestry, or farm purposes) and skid trails (for logging) in waters of the U.S. shall be held to the minimum feasible number, width, and total length consistent with the purpose of specific farming, silvicultural or mining operations, and local topographic and climatic conditions;

    (ii) All roads, temporary or permanent, shall be located sufficiently far from streams or other water bodies (except for portions of such roads which must cross water bodies) to minimize discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.;

    (iii) The road fill shall be bridged, culverted, or otherwise designed to prevent the restriction of expected flood flows;

    (iv) The fill shall be properly stabilized and maintained during and following construction to prevent erosion;

    (v) Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States to construct a road fill shall be made in a manner that minimizes the encroachment of trucks, tractors, bulldozers, or other heavy equipment within waters of the United States (including adjacent wetlands) that lie outside the lateral boundaries of the fill itself;

    (vi) In designing, constructing, and maintaining roads, vegetative disturbance in the waters of the U.S. shall be kept to a minimum;

    (vii) The design, construction and maintenance of the road crossing shall not disrupt the migration or other movement of those species of aquatic life inhabiting the water body;

    (viii) Borrow material shall be taken from upland sources whenever feasible;

    (ix) The discharge shall not take, or jeopardize the continued existence of, a threatened or endangered species as defined under the Endangered Species Act, or adversely modify or destroy the critical habitat of such species;

    (x) Discharges into breeding and nesting areas for migratory waterfowl, spawning areas, and wetlands shall be avoided if practical alternatives exist;

    (xi) The discharge shall not be located in the proximity of a public water supply intake;

    (xii) The discharge shall not occur in areas of concentrated shellfish production;

    (xiii) The discharge shall not occur in a component of the National Wild and Scenic River System;

    (xiv) The discharge of material shall consist of suitable material free from toxic pollutants in toxic amounts; and

    (xv) All temporary fills shall be removed in their entirety and the area restored to its original elevation.

    (b) If any discharge of dredged or fill material resulting from the activities listed in paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) of this section contains any toxic pollutant listed under section 307 of the CWA such discharge shall be subject to any applicable toxic effluent standard or prohibition, and shall require a section 404 permit.

    (c) Any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States incidental to any of the activities identified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) of this section must have a permit if it is part of an activity whose purpose is to convert an area of the waters of the United States into a use to which it was not previously subject, where the flow or circulation of waters of the United States may be impaired or the reach of such waters reduced. Where the proposed discharge will result in significant discernible alterations to flow or circulation, the presumption is that flow or circulation may be impaired by such alteration. For example, a permit will be required for the conversion of a cypress swamp to some other use or the conversion of a wetland from silvicultural to agricultural use when there is a discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States in conjunction with construction of dikes, drainage ditches or other works or structures used to effect such conversion. A conversion of a section 404 wetland to a non-wetland is a change in use of an area of waters of the United States. A discharge which elevates the bottom of waters of the United States without converting it to dry land does not thereby reduce the reach of, but may alter the flow or circulation of, waters of the United States.

    (d) Federal projects which qualify under the criteria contained in section 404(r) of the CWA are exempt from section 404 permit requirements, but may be subject to other State or Federal requirements.

    § 323.5   Program transfer to States.

#### § § 323.5

    Section 404(h) of the CWA allows the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to transfer administration of the section 404 permit program for discharges into certain waters of the United States to qualified States. (The program cannot be transferred for those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce shoreward to their ordinary high water mark, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to the high tide line, including wetlands adjacent thereto). See 40 CFR parts 233 and 124 for procedural regulations for transferring section 404 programs to States. Once a State's 404 program is approved and in effect, the Corps of Engineers will suspend processing of section 404 applications in the applicable waters and will transfer pending applications to the State agency responsible for administering the program. District engineers will assist EPA and the States in any way practicable to effect transfer and will develop appropriate procedures to ensure orderly and expeditious transfer.

    § 323.6   Special policies and procedures.

#### § § 323.6

    (a) The Secretary of the Army has delegated to the Chief of Engineers the authority to issue or deny section 404 permits. The district engineer will review applications for permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Administrator, EPA, under authority of section 404(b)(1) of the CWA. (see 40 CFR part 230.) Subject to consideration of any economic impact on navigation and anchorage pursuant to section 404(b)(2), a permit will be denied if the discharge that would be authorized by such a permit would not comply with the 404(b)(1) guidelines. If the district engineer determines that the proposed discharge would comply with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, he will grant the permit unless issuance would be contrary to the public interest.

    (b) The Corps will not issue a permit where the regional administrator of EPA has notified the district engineer and applicant in writing pursuant to 40 CFR 231.3(a)(1) that he intends to issue a public notice of a proposed determination to prohibit or withdraw the specification, or to deny, restrict or withdraw the use for specification, of any defined area as a disposal site in accordance with section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. However the Corps will continue to complete the administrative processing of the application while the section 404(c) procedures are underway including completion of final coordination with EPA under 33 CFR part 325.

  PART 324—PERMITS FOR OCEAN DUMPING OF DREDGED MATERIAL

### Part 324

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1413.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41235, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 324.1   General.

#### § § 324.1

    This regulation prescribes in addition to the general policies of 33 CFR part 320 and procedures of 33 CFR part 325, those special policies, practices and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers in connection with the review of applications for Department of the Army (DA) permits to authorize the transportation of dredged material by vessel or other vehicle for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters at dumping sites designated under 40 CFR part 228 pursuant to section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1413) (hereinafter referred to as section 103). See 33 CFR 320.2(h). Activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping in the ocean waters also require DA permits under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) for the dredging in navigable waters of the United States. Applicants for DA permits under this part should also refer to 33 CFR part 322 to satisfy the requirements of Section 10.

    § 324.2   Definitions.

#### § § 324.2

    For the purpose of this regulation, the following terms are defined:

    (a) The term  means those waters of the open seas lying seaward of the base line from which the territorial sea is measured, as provided for in the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone (15 UST 1606: TIAS 5639).

    (b) The term  means any material excavated or dredged from navigable waters of the United States.

    (c) The term  or  refers to the conveyance and related handling of dredged material by a vessel or other vehicle.

    § 324.3   Activities requiring permits.

#### § § 324.3

    (a)  DA permits are required for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters.

    (b)  (1) The transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters done by or on behalf of any Federal agency other than the activities of the Corps of Engineers is subject to the procedures of this regulation. Agreement for construction or engineering services performed for other agencies by the Corps of Engineers does not constitute authorization under these regulations. Division and district engineers will therefore advise Federal agencies accordingly and cooperate to the fullest extent in the expeditious processing of their applications. The activities of the Corps of Engineers that involve the transportation of dredged material for disposal in ocean waters are regulated by 33 CFR 209.145.

    (2) The policy provisions set out in 33 CFR 320.4(j) relating to state or local authorizations do not apply to work or structures undertaken by Federal agencies, except where compliance with non-Federal authorization is required by Federal law or Executive policy. Federal agencies are responsible for conformance with such laws and policies. (See EO 12088, October 18, 1978.) Federal agencies are not required to obtain and provide certification of compliance with effluent limitations and water quality standards from state or interstate water pollution control agencies in connection with activities involving the transport of dredged material for dumping into ocean waters beyond the territorial sea.

    § 324.4   Special procedures.

#### § § 324.4

    The Secretary of the Army has delegated to the Chief of Engineers the authority to issue or deny section 103 permits. The following additional procedures shall also be applicable under this regulation.

    (a)  For all applications for section 103 permits, the district engineer will issue a public notice which shall contain the information specified in 33 CFR 325.3.

    (b)  Applications for permits for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed dumping will unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems or economic potentialities. District engineers will apply the criteria established by the Administrator of EPA pursuant to section 102 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 in making this evaluation. (See 40 CFR parts 220-229) Where ocean dumping is determined to be necessary, the district engineer will, to the extent feasible, specify disposal sites using the recommendations of the Administrator pursuant to section 102(c) of the Act.

    (c)  When the Regional Administrator, EPA, in accordance with 40 CFR 225.2(b), advises the district engineer, in writing, that the proposed dumping will comply with the criteria, the district engineer will complete his evaluation of the application under this part and 33 CFR parts 320 and 325. If, however, the Regional Administrator advises the district engineer, in writing, that the proposed dumping does not comply with the criteria, the district engineer will proceed as follows:

    (1) The district engineer will determine whether there is an economically feasible alternative method or site available other than the proposed ocean disposal site. If there are other feasible alternative methods or sites available, the district engineer will evaluate them in accordance with 33 CFR parts 320, 322, 323, and 325 and this part, as appropriate.

    (2) If the district engineer determines that there is no economically feasible alternative method or site available, and the proposed project is otherwise found to be not contrary to the public interest, he will so advise the Regional Administrator setting forth his reasons for such determination. If the Regional Administrator has not removed his objection within 15 days, the district engineer will submit a report of his determination to the Chief of Engineers for further coordination with the Administrator, EPA, and decision. The report forwarding the case will contain the analysis of whether there are other economically feasible methods or sites available to dispose of the dredged material.

    (d)  The Chief of Engineers shall evaluate the permit application and make a decision to deny the permit or recommend its issuance. If the decision of the Chief of Engineers is that ocean dumping at the proposed disposal site is required because of the unavailability of economically feasible alternatives, he shall so certify and request that the Secretary of the Army seek a waiver from the Administrator, EPA, of the criteria or of the critical site designation in accordance with 40 CFR 225.4.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41236, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 325.1   Applications for permits.

#### § § 325.1

    (a)  The processing procedures of this part apply to any Department of the Army (DA) permit. Special procedures and additional information are contained in 33 CFR parts 320 through 324, 327 and part 330. This part is arranged in the basic timing sequence used by the Corps of Engineers in processing applications for DA permits.

    (b)  The district staff element having responsibility for administering, processing, and enforcing federal laws and regulations relating to the Corps of Engineers regulatory program shall be available to advise potential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for later federal action. The district engineer will establish local procedures and policies including appropriate publicity programs which will allow potential applicants to contact the district engineer or the regulatory staff element to request pre-application consultation. Upon receipt of such request, the district engineer will assure the conduct of an orderly process which may involve other staff elements and affected agencies (Federal, state, or local) and the public. This early process should be brief but thorough so that the potential applicant may begin to assess the viability of some of the more obvious potential alternatives in the application. The district engineer will endeavor, at this stage, to provide the potential applicant with all helpful information necessary in pursuing the application, including factors which the Corps must consider in its permit decision making process. Whenever the district engineer becomes aware of planning for work which may require a DA permit and which may involve the preparation of an environmental document, he shall contact the principals involved to advise them of the requirement for the permit(s) and the attendant public interest review including the development of an environmental document. Whenever a potential applicant indicates the intent to submit an application for work which may require the preparation of an environmental document, a single point of contact shall be designated within the district's regulatory staff to effectively coordinate the regulatory process, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) procedures and all attendant reviews, meetings, hearings, and other actions, including the scoping process if appropriate, leading to a decision by the district engineer. Effort devoted to this process should be commensurate with the likelihood of a permit application actually being submitted to the Corps. The regulatory staff coordinator shall maintain an open relationship with each potential applicant or his consultants so as to assure that the potential applicant is fully aware of the substance (both quantitative and qualitative) of the data required by the district engineer for use in preparing an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement (EIS) in accordance with 33 CFR part 230, Appendix B.

    (c)  Applicants for all individual DA permits must use the standard application form (ENG Form 4345, OMB Approval No. OMB 49-R0420). Local variations of the application form for purposes of facilitating coordination with federal, state and local agencies may be used. The appropriate form may be obtained from the district office having jurisdiction over the waters in which the activity is proposed to be located. Certain activities have been authorized by general permits and do not require submission of an application form but may require a separate notification.

    (d)  (1) The application must include a complete description of the proposed activity including necessary drawings, sketches, or plans sufficient for public notice (detailed engineering plans and specifications are not required); the location, purpose and need for the proposed activity; scheduling of the activity; the names and addresses of adjoining property owners; the location and dimensions of adjacent structures; and a list of authorizations required by other federal, interstate, state, or local agencies for the work, including all approvals received or denials already made. See § 325.3 for information required to be in public notices. District and division engineers are not authorized to develop additional information forms but may request specific information on a case-by-case basis. (See § 325.1(e)).

    (2) All activities which the applicant plans to undertake which are reasonably related to the same project and for which a DA permit would be required should be included in the same permit application. District engineers should reject, as incomplete, any permit application which fails to comply with this requirement. For example, a permit application for a marina will include dredging required for access as well as any fill associated with construction of the marina.

    (3) If the activity would involve dredging in navigable waters of the United States, the application must include a description of the type, composition and quantity of the material to be dredged, the method of dredging, and the site and plans for disposal of the dredged material.

    (4) If the activity would include the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposing of it in ocean waters the application must include the source of the material; the purpose of the discharge, a description of the type, composition and quantity of the material; the method of transportation and disposal of the material; and the location of the disposal site. Certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act is required for such discharges into waters of the United States.

    (5) If the activity would include the construction of a filled area or pile or float-supported platform the project description must include the use of, and specific structures to be erected on, the fill or platform.

    (6) If the activity would involve the construction of an impoundment structure, the applicant may be required to demonstrate that the structure complies with established state dam safety criteria or that the structure has been designed by qualified persons and, in appropriate cases, independently reviewed (and modified as the review would indicate) by similarly qualified persons. No specific design criteria are to be prescribed nor is an independent detailed engineering review to be made by the district engineer.

    (7) For activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, the application must include a statement describing how impacts to waters of the United States are to be avoided and minimized. The application must also include either a statement describing how impacts to waters of the United States are to be compensated for or a statement explaining why compensatory mitigation should not be required for the proposed impacts. (See § 332.4(b)(1) of this chapter.)

    (8)  The application must be signed by the person who desires to undertake the proposed activity (, the applicant) or by a duly authorized agent. When the applicant is represented by an agent, that information will be included in the space provided on the application or by a separate written statement. The signature of the applicant or the agent will be an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application, except where the lands are under the control of the Corps of Engineers, in which cases the district engineer will coordinate the transfer of the real estate and the permit action. An application may include the activity of more than one owner provided the character of the activity of each owner is similar and in the same general area and each owner submits a statement designating the same agent.

    (9) If the activity would involve the construction or placement of an artificial reef, as defined in 33 CFR 322.2(g), in the navigable waters of the United States or in the waters overlying the outer continental shelf, the application must include provisions for siting, constructing, monitoring, and managing the artificial reef.

    (10)  An application will be determined to be complete when sufficient information is received to issue a public notice (See 33 CFR 325.1(d) and 325.3(a).) The issuance of a public notice will not be delayed to obtain information necessary to evaluate an application.

    (e)  In addition to the information indicated in paragraph (d) of this section, the applicant will be required to furnish only such additional information as the district engineer deems essential to make a public interest determination including, where applicable, a determination of compliance with the section 404(b)(1) guidelines or ocean dumping criteria. Such additional information may include environmental data and information on alternate methods and sites as may be necessary for the preparation of the required environmental documentation.

    (f)  Fees are required for permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, and sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. A fee of $100.00 will be charged when the planned or ultimate purpose of the project is commercial or industrial in nature and is in support of operations that charge for the production, distribution or sale of goods or services. A $10.00 fee will be charged for permit applications when the proposed work is non-commercial in nature and would provide personal benefits that have no connection with a commercial enterprise. The final decision as to the basis for a fee (commercial vs. non-commercial) shall be solely the responsibility of the district engineer. No fee will be charged if the applicant withdraws the application at any time prior to issuance of the permit or if the permit is denied. Collection of the fee will be deferred until the proposed activity has been determined to be not contrary to the public interest. Multiple fees are not to be charged if more than one law is applicable. Any modification significant enough to require publication of a public notice will also require a fee. No fee will be assessed when a permit is transferred from one property owner to another. No fees will be charged for time extensions, general permits or letters of permission. Agencies or instrumentalities of federal, state or local governments will not be required to pay any fee in connection with permits.

    § 325.2   Processing of applications.

#### § § 325.2

    (a)  (1) When an application for a permit is received the district engineer shall immediately assign it a number for identification, acknowledge receipt thereof, and advise the applicant of the number assigned to it. He shall review the application for completeness, and if the application is incomplete, request from the applicant within 15 days of receipt of the application any additional information necessary for further processing.

    (2) Within 15 days of receipt of an application the district engineer will either determine that the application is complete (see 33 CFR 325.1(d)(9) and issue a public notice as described in § 325.3 of this part, unless specifically exempted by other provisions of this regulation or that it is incomplete and notify the applicant of the information necessary for a complete application. The district engineer will issue a supplemental, revised, or corrected public notice if in his view there is a change in the application data that would affect the public's review of the proposal.

    (3) The district engineer will consider all comments received in response to the public notice in his subsequent actions on the permit application. Receipt of the comments will be acknowledged, if appropriate, and they will be made a part of the administrative record of the application. Comments received as form letters or petitions may be acknowledged as a group to the person or organization responsible for the form letter or petition. If comments relate to matters within the special expertise of another federal agency, the district engineer may seek the advice of that agency. If the district engineer determines, based on comments received, that he must have the views of the applicant on a particular issue to make a public interest determination, the applicant will be given the opportunity to furnish his views on such issue to the district engineer (see § 325.2(d)(5)). At the earliest practicable time other substantive comments will be furnished to the applicant for his information and any views he may wish to offer. A summary of the comments, the actual letters or portions thereof, or representative comment letters may be furnished to the applicant. The applicant may voluntarily elect to contact objectors in an attempt to resolve objections but will not be required to do so. District engineers will ensure that all parties are informed that the Corps alone is responsible for reaching a decision on the merits of any application. The district engineer may also offer Corps regulatory staff to be present at meetings between applicants and objectors, where appropriate, to provide information on the process, to mediate differences, or to gather information to aid in the decision process. The district engineer should not delay processing of the application unless the applicant requests a reasonable delay, normally not to exceed 30 days, to provide additional information or comments.

    (4) The district engineer will follow Appendix B of 33 CFR part 230 for environmental procedures and documentation required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. A decision on a permit application will require either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement unless it is included within a categorical exclusion.

    (5) The district engineer will also evaluate the application to determine the need for a public hearing pursuant to 33 CFR part 327.

    (6) After all above actions have been completed, the district engineer will determine in accordance with the record and applicable regulations whether or not the permit should be issued. He shall prepare a statement of findings (SOF) or, where an EIS has been prepared, a record of decision (ROD), on all permit decisions. The SOF or ROD shall include the district engineer's views on the probable effect of the proposed work on the public interest including conformity with the guidelines published for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (40 CFR part 230) or with the criteria for dumping of dredged material in ocean waters (40 CFR parts 220 to 229), if applicable, and the conclusions of the district engineer. The SOF or ROD shall be dated, signed, and included in the record prior to final action on the application. Where the district engineer has delegated authority to sign permits for and in his behalf, he may similarly delegate the signing of the SOF or ROD. If a district engineer makes a decision on a permit application which is contrary to state or local decisions (33 CFR 320.4(j) (2) & (4)), the district engineer will include in the decision document the significant national issues and explain how they are overriding in importance. If a permit is warranted, the district engineer will determine the special conditions, if any, and duration which should be incorporated into the permit. In accordance with the authorities specified in § 325.8 of this part, the district engineer will take final action or forward the application with all pertinent comments, records, and studies, including the final EIS or environmental assessment, through channels to the official authorized to make the final decision. The report forwarding the application for decision will be in a format prescribed by the Chief of Engineers. District and division engineers will notify the applicant and interested federal and state agencies that the application has been forwarded to higher headquarters. The district or division engineer may, at his option, disclose his recommendation to the news media and other interested parties, with the caution that it is only a recommendation and not a final decision. Such disclosure is encouraged in permit cases which have become controversial and have been the subject of stories in the media or have generated strong public interest. In those cases where the application is forwarded for decision in the format prescribed by the Chief of Engineers, the report will serve as the SOF or ROD. District engineers will generally combine the SOF, environmental assessment, and findings of no significant impact (FONSI), 404(b)(1) guideline analysis, and/or the criteria for dumping of dredged material in ocean waters into a single document.

    (7) If the final decision is to deny the permit, the applicant will be advised in writing of the reason(s) for denial. If the final decision is to issue the permit and a standard individual permit form will be used, the issuing official will forward the permit to the applicant for signature accepting the conditions of the permit. The permit is not valid until signed by the issuing official. Letters of permission require only the signature of the issuing official. Final action on the permit application is the signature on the letter notifying the applicant of the denial of the permit or signature of the issuing official on the authorizing document.

    (8) The district engineer will publish monthly a list of permits issued or denied during the previous month. The list will identify each action by public notice number, name of applicant, and brief description of activity involved. It will also note that relevant environmental documents and the SOF's or ROD's are available upon written request and, where applicable, upon the payment of administrative fees. This list will be distributed to all persons who may have an interest in any of the public notices listed.

    (9) Copies of permits will be furnished to other agencies in appropriate cases as follows:

    (i) If the activity involves the construction of artificial islands, installations or other devices on the outer continental shelf, to the Director, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic Center, Washington, DC 20390 Attention, Code NS12, and to the National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey, N/CS261, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.

    (ii) If the activity involves the construction of structures to enhance fish propagation (e.g., fishing reefs) along the coasts of the United States, to the Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic Center and National Ocean Service as in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section and to the Director, Office of Marine Recreational Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service, Washington, DC 20235.

    (iii) If the activity involves the erection of an aerial transmission line, submerged cable, or submerged pipeline across a navigable water of the United States, to the National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey, N/CS261, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.

    (iv) If the activity is listed in paragraphs (a)(9) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, or involves the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters, to the appropriate District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard.

    (b) —(1)  If the district engineer determines that water quality certification for the proposed activity is necessary under the provisions of section 401 of the Clean Water Act, he shall so notify the applicant and obtain from him or the certifying agency a copy of such certification.

    (i) The public notice for such activity, which will contain a statement on certification requirements (see § 325.3(a)(8)), will serve as the notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act. If EPA determines that the proposed discharge may affect the quality of the waters of any state other than the state in which the discharge will originate, it will so notify such other state, the district engineer, and the applicant. If such notice or a request for supplemental information is not received within 30 days of issuance of the public notice, the district engineer will assume EPA has made a negative determination with respect to section 401(a)(2). If EPA determines another state's waters may be affected, such state has 60 days from receipt of EPA's notice to determine if the proposed discharge will affect the quality of its waters so as to violate any water quality requirement in such state, to notify EPA and the district engineer in writing of its objection to permit issuance, and to request a public hearing. If such occurs, the district engineer will hold a public hearing in the objecting state. Except as stated below, the hearing will be conducted in accordance with 33 CFR part 327. The issues to be considered at the public hearing will be limited to water quality impacts. EPA will submit its evaluation and recommendations at the hearing with respect to the state's objection to permit issuance. Based upon the recommendations of the objecting state, EPA, and any additional evidence presented at the hearing, the district engineer will condition the permit, if issued, in such a manner as may be necessary to insure compliance with applicable water quality requirements. If the imposition of conditions cannot, in the district engineer's opinion, insure such compliance, he will deny the permit.

    (ii) No permit will be granted until required certification has been obtained or has been waived. A waiver may be explicit, or will be deemed to occur if the certifying agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification within sixty days after receipt of such a request unless the district engineer determines a shorter or longer period is reasonable for the state to act. In determining whether or not a waiver period has commenced or waiver has occurred, the district engineer will verify that the certifying agency has received a valid request for certification. If, however, special circumstances identified by the district engineer require that action on an application be taken within a more limited period of time, the district engineer shall determine a reasonable lesser period of time, advise the certifying agency of the need for action by a particular date, and that, if certification is not received by that date, it will be considered that the requirement for certification has been waived. Similarly, if it appears that circumstances may reasonably require a period of time longer than sixty days, the district engineer, based on information provided by the certifying agency, will determine a longer reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, at which time a waiver will be deemed to occur.

    (2)  If the proposed activity is to be undertaken in a state operating under a coastal zone management program approved by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Act (see 33 CFR 320.3(b)), the district engineer shall proceed as follows:

    (i) If the applicant is a federal agency, and the application involves a federal activity in or affecting the coastal zone, the district engineer shall forward a copy of the public notice to the agency of the state responsible for reviewing the consistency of federal activities. The federal agency applicant shall be responsible for complying with the CZM Act's directive for ensuring that federal agency activities are undertaken in a manner which is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with approved CZM Programs. (See 15 CFR part 930.) If the state coastal zone agency objects to the proposed federal activity on the basis of its inconsistency with the state's approved CZM Program, the district engineer shall not make a final decision on the application until the disagreeing parties have had an opportunity to utilize the procedures specified by the CZM Act for resolving such disagreements.

    (ii) If the applicant is not a federal agency and the application involves an activity affecting the coastal zone, the district engineer shall obtain from the applicant a certification that his proposed activity complies with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the approved state CZM Program. Upon receipt of the certification, the district engineer will forward a copy of the public notice (which will include the applicant's certification statement) to the state coastal zone agency and request its concurrence or objection. If the state agency objects to the certification or issues a decision indicating that the proposed activity requires further review, the district engineer shall not issue the permit until the state concurs with the certification statement or the Secretary of Commerce determines that the proposed activity is consistent with the purposes of the CZM Act or is necessary in the interest of national security. If the state agency fails to concur or object to a certification statement within six months of the state agency's receipt of the certification statement, state agency concurrence with the certification statement shall be conclusively presumed. District engineers will seek agreements with state CZM agencies that the agency's failure to provide comments during the public notice comment period will be considered as a concurrence with the certification or waiver of the right to concur or non-concur.

    (iii) If the applicant is requesting a permit for work on Indian reservation lands which are in the coastal zone, the district engineer shall treat the application in the same manner as prescribed for a Federal applicant in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. However, if the applicant is requesting a permit on non-trust Indian lands, and the state CZM agency has decided to assert jurisdiction over such lands, the district engineer shall treat the application in the same manner as prescribed for a non-Federal applicant in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

    (3)  If the proposed activity would involve any property listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, the district engineer will proceed in accordance with Corps National Historic Preservation Act implementing regulations.

    (4)  If the proposed activity would consist of the dredging of an access channel and/or berthing facility associated with an authorized federal navigation project, the activity will be included in the planning and coordination of the construction or maintenance of the federal project to the maximum extent feasible. Separate notice, hearing, and environmental documentation will not be required for activities so included and coordinated, and the public notice issued by the district engineer for these federal and associated non-federal activities will be the notice of intent to issue permits for those included non-federal dredging activities. The decision whether to issue or deny such a permit will be consistent with the decision on the federal project unless special considerations applicable to the proposed activity are identified. (See § 322.5(c).)

    (5)  Applications will be reviewed for the potential impact on threatened or endangered species pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act as amended. The district engineer will include a statement in the public notice of his current knowledge of endangered species based on his initial review of the application (see 33 CFR 325.2(a)(2)). If the district engineer determines that the proposed activity would not affect listed species or their critical habitat, he will include a statement to this effect in the public notice. If he finds the proposed activity may affect an endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat, he will initiate formal consultation procedures with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service. Public notices forwarded to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service will serve as the request for information on whether any listed or proposed to be listed endangered or threatened species may be present in the area which would be affected by the proposed activity, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Act. References, definitions, and consultation procedures are found in 50 CFR part 402.

    (c) [Reserved]

    (d)  The district engineer will be guided by the following time limits for the indicated steps in the evaluation process:

    (1) The public notice will be issued within 15 days of receipt of all information required to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with paragraph 325.1.(d) of this part.

    (2) The comment period on the public notice should be for a reasonable period of time within which interested parties may express their views concerning the permit. The comment period should not be more than 30 days nor less than 15 days from the date of the notice. Before designating comment periods less than 30 days, the district engineer will consider: (i) Whether the proposal is routine or noncontroversial,

    (ii) Mail time and need for comments from remote areas,

    (iii) Comments from similar proposals, and

    (iv) The need for a site visit. After considering the length of the original comment period, paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, and other pertinent factors, the district engineer may extend the comment period up to an additional 30 days if warranted.

    (3) District engineers will decide on all applications not later than 60 days after receipt of a complete application, unless (i) precluded as a matter of law or procedures required by law (see below),

    (ii) The case must be referred to higher authority (see § 325.8 of this part),

    (iii) The comment period is extended,

    (iv) A timely submittal of information or comments is not received from the applicant,

    (v) The processing is suspended at the request of the applicant, or

    (vi) Information needed by the district engineer for a decision on the application cannot reasonably be obtained within the 60-day period. Once the cause for preventing the decision from being made within the normal 60-day period has been satisfied or eliminated, the 60-day clock will start running again from where it was suspended. For example, if the comment period is extended by 30 days, the district engineer will, absent other restraints, decide on the application within 90 days of receipt of a complete application. Certain laws (e.g., the Clean Water Act, the CZM Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Preservation of Historical and Archeological Data Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act) require procedures such as state or other federal agency certifications, public hearings, environmental impact statements, consultation, special studies, and testing which may prevent district engineers from being able to decide certain applications within 60 days.

    (4) Once the district engineer has sufficient information to make his public interest determination, he should decide the permit application even though other agencies which may have regulatory jurisdiction have not yet granted their authorizations, except where such authorizations are, by federal law, a prerequisite to making a decision on the DA permit application. Permits granted prior to other (non-prerequisite) authorizations by other agencies should, where appropriate, be conditioned in such manner as to give those other authorities an opportunity to undertake their review without the applicant biasing such review by making substantial resource commitments on the basis of the DA permit. In unusual cases the district engineer may decide that due to the nature or scope of a specific proposal, it would be prudent to defer taking final action until another agency has acted on its authorization. In such cases, he may advise the other agency of his position on the DA permit while deferring his final decision.

    (5) The applicant will be given a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, to respond to requests of the district engineer. The district engineer may make such requests by certified letter and clearly inform the applicant that if he does not respond with the requested information or a justification why additional time is necessary, then his application will be considered withdrawn or a final decision will be made, whichever is appropriate. If additional time is requested, the district engineer will either grant the time, make a final decision, or consider the application as withdrawn.

    (6) The time requirements in these regulations are in terms of calendar days rather than in terms of working days.

    (e)  Division and district engineers are authorized to use alternative procedures as follows:

    (1)  Letters of permission are a type of permit issued through an abbreviated processing procedure which includes coordination with Federal and state fish and wildlife agencies, as required by the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and a public interest evaluation, but without the publishing of an individual public notice. The letter of permission will not be used to authorize the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters. Letters of permission may be used:

    (i) In those cases subject to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 when, in the opinion of the district engineer, the proposed work would be minor, would not have significant individual or cumulative impacts on environmental values, and should encounter no appreciable opposition.

    (ii) In those cases subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act after:

    (A) The district engineer, through consultation with Federal and state fish and wildlife agencies, the Regional Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, the state water quality certifying agency, and, if appropriate, the state Coastal Zone Management Agency, develops a list of categories of activities proposed for authorization under LOP procedures;

    (B) The district engineer issues a public notice advertising the proposed list and the LOP procedures, requesting comments and offering an opportunity for public hearing; and

    (C) A 401 certification has been issued or waived and, if appropriate, CZM consistency concurrence obtained or presumed either on a generic or individual basis.

    (2)  Regional permits are a type of general permit as defined in 33 CFR 322.2(f) and 33 CFR 323.2(n). They may be issued by a division or district engineer after compliance with the other procedures of this regulation. After a regional permit has been issued, individual activities falling within those categories that are authorized by such regional permits do not have to be further authorized by the procedures of this regulation. The issuing authority will determine and add appropriate conditions to protect the public interest. When the issuing authority determines on a case-by-case basis that the concerns for the aquatic environment so indicate, he may exercise discretionary authority to override the regional permit and require an individual application and review. A regional permit may be revoked by the issuing authority if it is determined that it is contrary to the public interest provided the procedures of § 325.7 of this part are followed. Following revocation, applications for future activities in areas covered by the regional permit shall be processed as applications for individual permits. No regional permit shall be issued for a period of more than five years.

    (3)  Division and district engineers are authorized and encouraged to develop joint procedures with states and other Federal agencies with ongoing permit programs for activities also regulated by the Department of the Army. Such procedures may be substituted for the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section provided that the substantive requirements of those sections are maintained. Division and district engineers are also encouraged to develop management techniques such as joint agency review meetings to expedite the decision-making process. However, in doing so, the applicant's rights to a full public interest review and independent decision by the district or division engineer must be strictly observed.

    (4)  Division engineers are authorized to approve special processing procedures in emergency situations. An “emergency” is a situation which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if corrective action requiring a permit is not undertaken within a time period less than the normal time needed to process the application under standard procedures. In emergency situations, the district engineer will explain the circumstances and recommend special procedures to the division engineer who will instruct the district engineer as to further processing of the application. Even in an emergency situation, reasonable efforts will be made to receive comments from interested Federal, state, and local agencies and the affected public. Also, notice of any special procedures authorized and their rationale is to be appropriately published as soon as practicable.

    § 325.3   Public notice.

#### § § 325.3

    (a)  The public notice is the primary method of advising all interested parties of the proposed activity for which a permit is sought and of soliciting comments and information necessary to evaluate the probable impact on the public interest. The notice must, therefore, include sufficient information to give a clear understanding of the nature and magnitude of the activity to generate meaningful comment. The notice should include the following items of information:

    (1) Applicable statutory authority or authorities;

    (2) The name and address of the applicant;

    (3) The name or title, address and telephone number of the Corps employee from whom additional information concerning the application may be obtained;

    (4) The location of the proposed activity;

    (5) A brief description of the proposed activity, its purpose and intended use, so as to provide sufficient information concerning the nature of the activity to generate meaningful comments, including a description of the type of structures, if any, to be erected on fills or pile or float-supported platforms, and a description of the type, composition, and quantity of materials to be discharged or disposed of in the ocean;

    (6) A plan and elevation drawing showing the general and specific site location and character of all proposed activities, including the size relationship of the proposed structures to the size of the impacted waterway and depth of water in the area;

    (7) If the proposed activity would occur in the territorial seas or ocean waters, a description of the activity's relationship to the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured;

    (8) A list of other government authorizations obtained or requested by the applicant, including required certifications relative to water quality, coastal zone management, or marine sanctuaries;

    (9) If appropriate, a statement that the activity is a categorical exclusion for purposes of NEPA (see paragraph 7 of Appendix B to 33 CFR part 230);

    (10) A statement of the district engineer's current knowledge on historic properties;

    (11) A statement of the district engineer's current knowledge on endangered species (see § 325.2(b)(5));

    (12) A statement(s) on evaluation factors (see § 325.3(c));

    (13) Any other available information which may assist interested parties in evaluating the likely impact of the proposed activity, if any, on factors affecting the public interest;

    (14) The comment period based on § 325.2(d)(2);

    (15) A statement that any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in the notice, that a public hearing be held to consider the application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing;

    (16) For non-federal applications in states with an approved CZM Plan, a statement on compliance with the approved Plan; and

    (17) In addition, for section 103 (ocean dumping) activities:

    (i) The specific location of the proposed disposal site and its physical boundaries;

    (ii) A statement as to whether the proposed disposal site has been designated for use by the Administrator, EPA, pursuant to section 102(c) of the Act;

    (iii) If the proposed disposal site has not been designated by the Administrator, EPA, a description of the characteristics of the proposed disposal site and an explanation as to why no previously designated disposal site is feasible;

    (iv) A brief description of known dredged material discharges at the proposed disposal site;

    (v) Existence and documented effects of other authorized disposals that have been made in the disposal area (e.g., heavy metal background reading and organic carbon content);

    (vi) An estimate of the length of time during which disposal would continue at the proposed site; and

    (vii) Information on the characteristics and composition of the dredged material.

    (b)  District engineers will publish a public notice for all proposed regional general permits and for significant modifications to, or reissuance of, existing regional permits within their area of jurisdiction. Public notices for statewide regional permits may be issued jointly by the affected Corps districts. The notice will include all applicable information necessary to provide a clear understanding of the proposal. In addition, the notice will state the availability of information at the district office which reveals the Corps' provisional determination that the proposed activities comply with the requirements for issuance of general permits. District engineers will publish a public notice for nationwide permits in accordance with 33 CFR 330.4.

    (c)  A paragraph describing the various evaluation factors on which decisions are based shall be included in every public notice.

    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the following will be included:

    (2) If the activity would involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposing of it in ocean waters, the public notice shall also indicate that the evaluation of the impact of the activity on the public interest will include application of the guidelines promulgated by the Administrator, EPA, (40 CFR part 230) or of the criteria established under authority of section 102(a) of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (40 CFR parts 220 to 229), as appropriate. (See 33 CFR parts 323 and 324).

    (3) In cases involving construction of artificial islands, installations and other devices on outer continental shelf lands which are under mineral lease from the Department of the Interior, the notice will contain the following statement: “The decision as to whether a permit will be issued will be based on an evaluation of the impact of the proposed work on navigation and national security.”

    (d)  (1) Public notices will be distributed for posting in post offices or other appropriate public places in the vicinity of the site of the proposed work and will be sent to the applicant, to appropriate city and county officials, to adjoining property owners, to appropriate state agencies, to appropriate Indian Tribes or tribal representatives, to concerned Federal agencies, to local, regional and national shipping and other concerned business and conservation organizations, to appropriate River Basin Commissions, to appropriate state and areawide clearing houses as prescribed by OMB Circular A-95, to local news media and to any other interested party. Copies of public notices will be sent to all parties who have specifically requested copies of public notices, to the U.S. Senators and Representatives for the area where the work is to be performed, the field representative of the Secretary of the Interior, the Regional Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Regional Director of the National Park Service, the Regional Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Regional Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the head of the state agency responsible for fish and wildlife resources, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard.

    (2) In addition to the general distribution of public notices cited above, notices will be sent to other addressees in appropriate cases as follows:

    (i) If the activity would involve structures or dredging along the shores of the seas or Great Lakes, to the Coastal Engineering Research Center, Washington, DC 20016.

    (ii) If the activity would involve construction of fixed structures or artificial islands on the outer continental shelf or in the territorial seas, to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Installations, and Logistics (ASD(MI&L)), Washington, DC 20310; the Director, Defense Mapping Agency (Hydrographic Center) Washington, DC 20390, Attention, Code NS12; and the National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey, N/CS261, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282, and to affected military installations and activities.

    (iii) If the activity involves the construction of structures to enhance fish propagation (e.g., fishing reefs) along the coasts of the United States, to the Director, Office of Marine Recreational Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service, Washington, DC 20235.

    (iv) If the activity involves the construction of structures which may affect aircraft operations or for purposes associated with seaplane operations, to the Regional Director of the Federal Aviation Administration.

    (v) If the activity would be in connection with a foreign-trade zone, to the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 and to the appropriate District Director of Customs as Resident Representative, Foreign-Trade Zones Board.

    (3) It is presumed that all interested parties and agencies will wish to respond to public notices; therefore, a lack of response will be interpreted as meaning that there is no objection to the proposed project. A copy of the public notice with the list of the addresses to whom the notice was sent will be included in the record. If a question develops with respect to an activity for which another agency has responsibility and that other agency has not responded to the public notice, the district engineer may request its comments. Whenever a response to a public notice has been received from a member of Congress, either in behalf of a constituent or himself, the district engineer will inform the member of Congress of the final decision.

    (4) District engineers will update public notice mailing lists at least once every two years.

    § 325.4   Conditioning of permits.

#### § § 325.4

    (a) District engineers will add special conditions to Department of the Army permits when such conditions are necessary to satisfy legal requirements or to otherwise satisfy the public interest requirement. Permit conditions will be directly related to the impacts of the proposal, appropriate to the scope and degree of those impacts, and reasonably enforceable.

    (1) Legal requirements which may be satisfied by means of Corps permit conditions include compliance with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, the EPA ocean dumping criteria, the Endangered Species Act, and requirements imposed by conditions on state section 401 water quality certifications.

    (2) Where appropriate, the district engineer may take into account the existence of controls imposed under other federal, state, or local programs which would achieve the objective of the desired condition, or the existence of an enforceable agreement between the applicant and another party concerned with the resource in question, in determining whether a proposal complies with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, ocean dumping criteria, and other applicable statutes, and is not contrary to the public interest. In such cases, the Department of the Army permit will be conditioned to state that material changes in, or a failure to implement and enforce such program or agreement, will be grounds for modifying, suspending, or revoking the permit.

    (3) Such conditions may be accomplished on-site, or may be accomplished off-site for mitigation of significant losses which are specifically identifiable, reasonably likely to occur, and of importance to the human or aquatic environment.

    (b) District engineers are authorized to add special conditions, exclusive of paragraph (a) of this section, at the applicant's request or to clarify the permit application.

    (c) If the district engineer determines that special conditions are necessary to insure the proposal will not be contrary to the public interest, but those conditions would not be reasonably implementable or enforceable, he will deny the permit.

    (d)  If the district engineer has reason to consider that the permittee might be prevented from completing work which is necessary to protect the public interest, he may require the permittee to post a bond of sufficient amount to indemnify the government against any loss as a result of corrective action it might take.

    § 325.5   Forms of permits.

#### § § 325.5

    (a)  (1) DA permits under this regulation will be in the form of individual permits or general permits. The basic format shall be ENG Form 1721, DA Permit (Appendix A).

    (2) The general conditions included in ENG Form 1721 are normally applicable to all permits; however, some conditions may not apply to certain permits and may be deleted by the issuing officer. Special conditions applicable to the specific activity will be included in the permit as necessary to protect the public interest in accordance with § 325.4 of this part.

    (b) —(1)  A standard permit is one which has been processed through the public interest review procedures, including public notice and receipt of comments, described throughout this part. The standard individual permit shall be issued using ENG Form 1721.

    (2)  A letter of permission will be issued where procedures of § 325.2(e)(1) have been followed. It will be in letter form and will identify the permittee, the authorized work and location of the work, the statutory authority, any limitations on the work, a construction time limit and a requirement for a report of completed work. A copy of the relevant general conditions from ENG Form 1721 will be attached and will be incorporated by reference into the letter of permission.

    (c) —(1)  Regional permits are a type of general permit. They may be issued by a division or district engineer after compliance with the other procedures of this regulation. If the public interest so requires, the issuing authority may condition the regional permit to require a case-by-case reporting and acknowledgment system. However, no separate applications or other authorization documents will be required.

    (2)  Nationwide permits are a type of general permit and represent DA authorizations that have been issued by the regulation (33 CFR part 330) for certain specified activities nationwide. If certain conditions are met, the specified activities can take place without the need for an individual or regional permit.

    (3)  Programmatic permits are a type of general permit founded on an existing state, local or other Federal agency program and designed to avoid duplication with that program.

    (d)  Permits for structures in interstate navigable waters of the United States under section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 will be drafted at DA level.

    § 325.6   Duration of permits.

#### § § 325.6

    (a)  DA permits may authorize both the work and the resulting use. Permits continue in effect until they automatically expire or are modified, suspended, or revoked.

    (b)  Permits for the existence of a structure or other activity of a permanent nature are usually for an indefinite duration with no expiration date cited. However, where a temporary structure is authorized, or where restoration of a waterway is contemplated, the permit will be of limited duration with a definite expiration date.

    (c)  Permits for construction work, discharge of dredged or fill material, or other activity and any construction period for a structure with a permit of indefinite duration under paragraph (b) of this section will specify time limits for completing the work or activity. The permit may also specify a date by which the work must be started, normally within one year from the date of issuance. The date will be established by the issuing official and will provide reasonable times based on the scope and nature of the work involved. Permits issued for the transport of dredged material for the purpose of disposing of it in ocean waters will specify a completion date for the disposal not to exceed three years from the date of permit issuance.

    (d)  An authorization or construction period will automatically expire if the permittee fails to request and receive an extension of time. Extensions of time may be granted by the district engineer. The permittee must request the extension and explain the basis of the request, which will be granted unless the district engineer determines that an extension would be contrary to the public interest. Requests for extensions will be processed in accordance with the regular procedures of § 325.2 of this part, including issuance of a public notice, except that such processing is not required where the district engineer determines that there have been no significant changes in the attendant circumstances since the authorization was issued.

    (e)  If the authorized work includes periodic maintenance dredging, an expiration date for the authorization of that maintenance dredging will be included in the permit. The expiration date, which in no event is to exceed ten years from the date of issuance of the permit, will be established by the issuing official after evaluation of the proposed method of dredging and disposal of the dredged material in accordance with the requirements of 33 CFR parts 320 to 325. In such cases, the district engineer shall require notification of the maintenance dredging prior to actual performance to insure continued compliance with the requirements of this regulation and 33 CFR parts 320 to 324. If the permittee desires to continue maintenance dredging beyond the expiration date, he must request a new permit. The permittee should be advised to apply for the new permit six months prior to the time he wishes to do the maintenance work.

    § 325.7   Modification, suspension, or revocation of permits.

#### § § 325.7

    (a)  The district engineer may reevaluate the circumstances and conditions of any permit, including regional permits, either on his own motion, at the request of the permittee, or a third party, or as the result of periodic progress inspections, and initiate action to modify, suspend, or revoke a permit as may be made necessary by considerations of the public interest. In the case of regional permits, this reevaluation may cover individual activities, categories of activities, or geographic areas. Among the factors to be considered are the extent of the permittee's compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit; whether or not circumstances relating to the authorized activity have changed since the permit was issued or extended, and the continuing adequacy of or need for the permit conditions; any significant objections to the authorized activity which were not earlier considered; revisions to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities; and the extent to which modification, suspension, or other action would adversely affect plans, investments and actions the permittee has reasonably made or taken in reliance on the permit. Significant increases in scope of a permitted activity will be processed as new applications for permits in accordance with § 325.2 of this part, and not as modifications under this section.

    (b)  Upon request by the permittee or, as a result of reevaluation of the circumstances and conditions of a permit, the district engineer may determine that the public interest requires a modification of the terms or conditions of the permit. In such cases, the district engineer will hold informal consultations with the permittee to ascertain whether the terms and conditions can be modified by mutual agreement. If a mutual agreement is reached on modification of the terms and conditions of the permit, the district engineer will give the permittee written notice of the modification, which will then become effective on such date as the district engineer may establish. In the event a mutual agreement cannot be reached by the district engineer and the permittee, the district engineer will proceed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section if immediate suspension is warranted. In cases where immediate suspension is not warranted but the district engineer determines that the permit should be modified, he will notify the permittee of the proposed modification and reasons therefor, and that he may request a meeting with the district engineer and/or a public hearing. The modification will become effective on the date set by the district engineer which shall be at least ten days after receipt of the notice by the permittee unless a hearing or meeting is requested within that period. If the permittee fails or refuses to comply with the modification, the district engineer will proceed in accordance with 33 CFR part 326. The district engineer shall consult with resource agencies before modifying any permit terms or conditions, that would result in greater impacts, for a project about which that agency expressed a significant interest in the term, condition, or feature being modified prior to permit issuance.

    (c)  The district engineer may suspend a permit after preparing a written determination and finding that immediate suspension would be in the public interest. The district engineer will notify the permittee in writing by the most expeditious means available that the permit has been suspended with the reasons therefor, and order the permittee to stop those activities previously authorized by the suspended permit. The permittee will also be advised that following this suspension a decision will be made to either reinstate, modify, or revoke the permit, and that he may within 10 days of receipt of notice of the suspension, request a meeting with the district engineer and/or a public hearing to present information in this matter. If a hearing is requested, the procedures prescribed in 33 CFR part 327 will be followed. After the completion of the meeting or hearing (or within a reasonable period of time after issuance of the notice to the permittee that the permit has been suspended if no hearing or meeting is requested), the district engineer will take action to reinstate, modify, or revoke the permit.

    (d)  Following completion of the suspension procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, if revocation of the permit is found to be in the public interest, the authority who made the decision on the original permit may revoke it. The permittee will be advised in writing of the final decision.

    (e)  The issuing official may, by following the procedures of this section, revoke regional permits for individual activities, categories of activities, or geographic areas. Where groups of permittees are involved, such as for categories of activities or geographic areas, the informal discussions provided in paragraph (b) of this section may be waived and any written notification may be made through the general public notice procedures of this regulation. If a regional permit is revoked, any permittee may then apply for an individual permit which shall be processed in accordance with these regulations.

    § 325.8   Authority to issue or deny permits.

#### § § 325.8

    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, the Secretary of the Army, subject to such conditions as he or his authorized representative may from time to time impose, has authorized the Chief of Engineers and his authorized representatives to issue or deny permits for dams or dikes in intrastate waters of the United States pursuant to section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; for construction or other work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act; or for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposing of it into ocean waters pursuant to section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended. The authority to issue or deny permits in interstate navigable waters of the United States pursuant to section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 has not been delegated to the Chief of Engineers or his authorized representatives.

    (b)  District engineers are authorized to issue or deny permits in accordance with these regulations pursuant to sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; section 404 of the Clean Water Act; and section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, in all cases not required to be referred to higher authority (see below). It is essential to the legality of a permit that it contain the name of the district engineer as the issuing officer. However, the permit need not be signed by the district engineer in person but may be signed for and in behalf of him by whomever he designates. In cases where permits are denied for reasons other than navigation or failure to obtain required local, state, or other federal approvals or certifications, the Statement of Findings must conclusively justify a denial decision. District engineers are authorized to deny permits without issuing a public notice or taking other procedural steps where required local, state, or other federal permits for the proposed activity have been denied or where he determines that the activity will clearly interfere with navigation except in all cases required to be referred to higher authority (see below). District engineers are also authorized to add, modify, or delete special conditions in permits in accordance with § 325.4 of this part, except for those conditions which may have been imposed by higher authority, and to modify, suspend and revoke permits according to the procedures of § 325.7 of this part. District engineers will refer the following applications to the division engineer for resolution:

    (1) When a referral is required by a written agreement between the head of a Federal agency and the Secretary of the Army;

    (2) When the recommended decision is contrary to the written position of the Governor of the state in which the work would be performed;

    (3) When there is substantial doubt as to authority, law, regulations, or policies applicable to the proposed activity;

    (4) When higher authority requests the application be forwarded for decision; or

    (5) When the district engineer is precluded by law or procedures required by law from taking final action on the application (e.g. section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, or territorial sea baseline changes).

    (c)  Division engineers will review and evaluate all permit applications referred by district engineers. Division engineers may authorize the issuance or denial of permits pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; section 404 of the Clean Water Act; and section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended; and the inclusion of conditions in accordance with § 325.4 of this part in all cases not required to be referred to the Chief of Engineers. Division engineers will refer the following applications to the Chief of Engineers for resolution:

    (1) When a referral is required by a written agreement between the head of a Federal agency and the Secretary of the Army;

    (2) When there is substantial doubt as to authority, law, regulations, or policies applicable to the proposed activity;

    (3) When higher authority requests the application be forwarded for decision; or

    (4) When the division engineer is precluded by law or procedures required by law from taking final action on the application.

    § 325.9   Authority to determine jurisdiction.

#### § § 325.9

    District engineers are authorized to determine the area defined by the terms “navigable waters of the United States” and “waters of the United States” except:

    (a) When a determination of navigability is made pursuant to 33 CFR 329.14 (division engineers have this authority); or

    (b) When EPA makes a section 404 jurisdiction determination under its authority.

    § 325.10   Publicity.

#### § § 325.10

    The district engineer will establish and maintain a program to assure that potential applicants for permits are informed of the requirements of this regulation and of the steps required to obtain permits for activities in waters of the United States or ocean waters. Whenever the district engineer becomes aware of plans being developed by either private or public entities which might require permits for implementation, he should advise the potential applicant in writing of the statutory requirements and the provisions of this regulation. Whenever the district engineer is aware of changes in Corps of Engineers regulatory jurisdiction, he will issue appropriate public notices.

  PART 326—ENFORCEMENT

### Part 326

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401  33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 U.S.C. 1413; 33 U.S.C. 2104; 33 U.S.C. 1319; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note.

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41246, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 326.1   Purpose.

#### § § 326.1

    This part prescribes enforcement policies (§ 326.2) and procedures applicable to activities performed without required Department of the Army permits (§ 326.3) and to activities not in compliance with the terms and conditions of issued Department of the Army permits (§ 326.4). Procedures for initiating legal actions are prescribed in § 326.5. Nothing contained in this part shall establish a non-discretionary duty on the part of district engineers nor shall deviation from these procedures give rise to a private right of action against a district engineer.

    § 326.2   Policy.

#### § § 326.2

    Enforcement, as part of the overall regulatory program of the Corps, is based on a policy of regulating the waters of the United States by discouraging activities that have not been properly authorized and by requiring corrective measures, where appropriate, to ensure those waters are not misused and to maintain the integrity of the program. There are several methods discussed in the remainder of this part which can be used either singly or in combination to implement this policy, while making the most effective use of the enforcement resources available. As EPA has independent enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act for unauthorized discharges, the district engineer should normally coordinate with EPA to determine the most effective and efficient manner by which resolution of a section 404 violation can be achieved.

    § 326.3   Unauthorized activities.

#### § § 326.3

    (a)  To detect unauthorized activities requiring permits, district engineers should make the best use of all available resources. Corps employees; members of the public; and representatives of state, local, and other Federal agencies should be encouraged to report suspected violations. Additionally, district engineers should consider developing joint surveillance procedures with Federal, state, or local agencies having similar regulatory responsibilities, special expertise, or interest.

    (b)  District engineers should take steps to investigate suspected violations in a timely manner. The scheduling of investigations will reflect the nature and location of the suspected violations, the anticipated impacts, and the most effective use of inspection resources available to the district engineer. These investigations should confirm whether a violation exists, and if so, will identify the extent of the violation and the parties responsible.

    (c)  Once the district engineer has determined that a violation exists, he should take appropriate steps to notify the responsible parties.

    (1) If the violation involves a project that is not complete, the district engineer's notification should be in the form of a cease and desist order prohibiting any further work pending resolution of the violation in accordance with the procedures contained in this part. See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for exception to this procedure.

    (2) If the violation involves a completed project, a cease and desist order should not be necessary. However, the district engineer should still notify the responsible parties of the violation.

    (3) All notifications, pursuant to paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, should identify the relevant statutory authorities, indicate potential enforcement consequences, and direct the responsible parties to submit any additional information that the district engineer may need at that time to determine what course of action he should pursue in resolving the violation; further information may be requested, as needed, in the future.

    (4) In situations which would, if a violation were not involved, qualify for emergency procedures pursuant to 33 CFR part 325.2(e)(4), the district engineer may decide it would not be appropriate to direct that the unauthorized work be stopped. Therefore, in such situations, the district engineer may, at his discretion, allow the work to continue, subject to appropriate limitations and conditions as he may prescribe, while the violation is being resolved in accordance with the procedures contained in this part.

    (5) When an unauthorized activity requiring a permit has been undertaken by American Indians (including Alaskan natives, Eskimos, and Aleuts, but not including Native Hawaiians) on reservation lands or in pursuit of specific treaty rights, the district engineer should use appropriate means to coordinate proposed directives and orders with the Assistant Chief Counsel for Indian Affairs (DAEN-CCI).

    (6) When an unauthorized activity requiring a permit has been undertaken by an official acting on behalf of a foreign government, the district engineer should use appropriate means to coordinate proposed directives and orders with the Office, Chief of Engineers, ATTN: DAEN-CCK.

    (d)  (1) The district engineer should, in appropriate cases, depending upon the nature of the impacts associated with the unauthorized, completed work, solicit the views of the Environmental Protection Agency; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other Federal, state, and local agencies to facilitate his decision on what initial corrective measures are required. If the district engineer determines as a result of his investigation, coordination, and preliminary evaluation that initial corrective measures are required, he should issue an appropriate order to the parties responsible for the violation. In determining what initial corrective measures are required, the district engineer should consider whether serious jeopardy to life, property, or important public resources (see 33 CFR 320.4) may be reasonably anticipated to occur during the period required for the ultimate resolution of the violation. In his order, the district engineer will specify the initial corrective measures required and the time limits for completing this work. In unusual cases where initial corrective measures substantially eliminate all current and future detrimental impacts resulting from the unauthorized work, further enforcement actions should normally be unnecessary. For all other cases, the district engineer's order should normally specify that compliance with the order will not foreclose the Government's options to initiate appropriate legal action or to later require the submission of a permit application.

    (2) An order requiring initial corrective measures that resolve the violation may also be issued by the district engineer in situations where the acceptance or processing of an after-the-fact permit application is prohibited or considered not appropriate pursuant to § 326.3(e)(1) (iii) through (iv) below. However, such orders will be issued only when the district engineer has reached an independent determination that such measures are necessary and appropriate.

    (3) It will not be necessary to issue a Corps permit in connection with initial corrective measures undertaken at the direction of the district engineer.

    (e)  (1) Following the completion of any required initial corrective measures, the district engineer will accept an after-the-fact permit application unless he determines that one of the exceptions listed in subparagraphs i-iv below is applicable. Applications for after-the-fact permits will be processed in accordance with the applicable procedures in 33 CFR parts 320 through 325. Situations where no permit application will be processed or where the acceptance of a permit application must be deferred are as follows:

    (i) No permit application will be processed when restoration of the waters of the United States has been completed that eliminates current and future detrimental impacts to the satisfaction of the district engineer.

    (ii) No permit application will be accepted in connection with a violation where the district engineer determines that legal action is appropriate (§ 326.5(a)) until such legal action has been completed.

    (iii) No permit application will be accepted where a Federal, state, or local authorization or certification, required by Federal law, has already been denied.

    (iv) No permit application will be accepted nor will the processing of an application be continued when the district engineer is aware of enforcement litigation that has been initiated by other Federal, state, or local regulatory agencies, unless he determines that concurrent processing of an after-the-fact permit application is clearly appropriate.

    (v) No appeal of an approved jurisdictional determination (JD) associated with an unauthorized activity or after-the-fact permit application will be accepted unless and until the applicant has furnished a signed statute of limitations tolling agreement to the district engineer. A separate statute of limitations tolling agreement will be prepared for each unauthorized activity. Any person who appeals an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or applies for an after-the-fact permit, where the application is accepted and evaluated by the Corps, thereby agrees that the statute of limitations regarding any violation associated with that application is suspended until one year after the final Corps decision, as defined at 33 CFR 331.10. Moreover, the recipient of an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or an application for an after-the-fact permit must also memorialize that agreement to toll the statute of limitations, by signing an agreement to that effect, in exchange for the Corps acceptance of the after-the-fact permit application, and/or any administrative appeal. Such agreement will state that, in exchange for the Corps acceptance of any after-the-fact permit application and/or any administrative appeal associated with the unauthorized activity, the responsible party agrees that the statute of limitations will be suspended (, tolled) until one year after the final Corps decision on the after-the-fact permit application or, if there is an administrative appeal, one year after the final Corps decision as defined at 33 CFR 331.10, whichever date is later.

    (2) Upon completion of his review in accordance with 33 CFR parts 320 through 325, the district engineer will determine if a permit should be issued, with special conditions if appropriate, or denied. In reaching a decision to issue, he must determine that the work involved is not contrary to the public interest, and if section 404 is applicable, that the work also complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's section 404(b)(1) guidelines. If he determines that a denial is warranted, his notification of denial should prescribe any final corrective actions required. His notification should also establish a reasonable period of time for the applicant to complete such actions unless he determines that further information is required before the corrective measures can be specified. If further information is required, the final corrective measures may be specified at a later date. If an applicant refuses to undertake prescribed corrective actions ordered subsequent to permit denial or refuses to accept a conditioned permit, the district engineer may initiate legal action in accordance with § 326.5.

    (f)  The procedural steps in this section are in the normal sequence. However, these regulations do not prohibit the streamlining of the enforcement process through the combining of steps.

    (g)  In all cases where the district engineer is aware that EPA is considering enforcement action, he should coordinate with EPA to attempt to avoid conflict or duplication. Such coordination applies to interim protective measures and after-the-fact permitting, as well as to appropriate legal enforcement actions.

    § 326.4   Supervision of authorized activities.

#### § § 326.4

    (a)  District engineers will, at their discretion, take reasonable measures to inspect permitted activities, as required, to ensure that these activities comply with specified terms and conditions. To supplement inspections by their enforcement personnel, district engineers should encourage their other personnel; members of the public; and interested state, local, and other Federal agency representatives to report suspected violations of Corps permits. To facilitate inspections, district engineers will, in appropriate cases, require that copies of ENG Form 4336 be posted conspicuously at the sites of authorized activities and will make available to all interested persons information on the terms and conditions of issued permits. The U.S. Coast Guard will inspect permitted ocean dumping activities pursuant to section 107(c) of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended.

    (b)  Section 326.4 does not establish a non-discretionary duty to inspect permitted activities for safety, sound engineering practices, or interference with other permitted or unpermitted structures or uses in the area. Further, the regulations implementing the Corps regulatory program do not establish a non-discretionary duty to inspect permitted activities for any other purpose.

    (c)  The expenses incurred in connection with the inspection of permitted activities will normally be paid by the Federal Government unless daily supervision or other unusual expenses are involved. In such unusual cases, the district engineer may condition permits to require permittees to pay inspection expenses pursuant to the authority contained in section 9701 of Pub L. 97-258 (33 U.S.C. 9701). The collection and disposition of inspection expense funds obtained from applicants will be administered in accordance with the relevant Corps regulations governing such funds.

    (d)  If a district engineer determines that a permittee has violated the terms or conditions of the permit and that the violation is sufficiently serious to require an enforcement action, then he should, unless at his discretion he deems it inappropriate: (1) First contact the permittee;

    (2) Request corrected plans reflecting actual work, if needed; and

    (3) Attempt to resolve the violation. Resolution of the violation may take the form of the permitted project being voluntarily brought into compliance or of a permit modification (33 CFR 325.7(b)). If a mutually agreeable solution cannot be reached, a written order requiring compliance should normally be issued and delivered by personal service. Issuance of an order is not, however, a prerequisite to legal action. If an order is issued, it will specify a time period of not more than 30 days for bringing the permitted project into compliance, and a copy will be sent to the appropriate state official pursuant to section 404(s)(2) of the Clean Water Act. If the permittee fails to comply with the order within the specified period of time, the district engineer may consider using the suspension/revocation procedures in 33 CFR 325.7(c) and/or he may recommend legal action in accordance with § 326.5.

    § 326.5   Legal action.

#### § § 326.5

    (a)  For cases the district engineer determines to be appropriate, he will recommend criminal or civil actions to obtain penalties for violations, compliance with the orders and directives he has issued pursuant to §§ 326.3 and 326.4, or other relief as appropriate. Appropriate cases for criminal or civil action include, but are not limited to, violations which, in the district engineer's opinion, are willful, repeated, flagrant, or of substantial impact.

    (b)  If the district engineer determines that legal action is appropriate, he will prepare a litigation report or such other documentation that he and the local U.S. Attorney have mutually agreed to, which contains an analysis of the information obtained during his investigation of the violation or during the processing of a permit application and a recommendation of appropriate legal action. The litigation report or alternative documentation will also recommend what, if any, restoration or mitigative measures are required and will provide the rationale for any such recommendation.

    (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, district engineers are authorized to refer cases directly to the U.S. Attorney. Because of the unique legal system in the Trust Territories, all cases over which the Department of Justice has no authority will be referred to the Attorney General for the trust Territories. Information copies of all letters of referral shall be forwarded to the appropriate division counsel, the Office, Chief of Engineers, ATTN: DAEN-CCK, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), and the Chief of the Environmental Defense Section, Lands and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice.

    (d)  District engineers will forward litigation reports with recommendations through division offices to the Office, Chief of Engineers, ATTN: DAEN-CCK, for all cases that qualify under the following criteria:

    (1) Significant precedential or controversial questions of law or fact;

    (2) Requests for elevation to the Washington level by the Department of Justice;

    (3) Violations of section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899;

    (4) Violations of section 103 the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972;

    (5) All cases involving violations by American Indians (original of litigation report to DAEN-CCI with copy to DAEN-CCK) on reservation lands or in pursuit of specific treaty rights;

    (6) All cases involving violations by officials acting on behalf of foreign governments; and

    (7) Cases requiring action pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e)  In cases where the local U.S. Attorney declines to take legal action, it would be appropriate for the district engineer to close the enforcement case record unless he believes that the case warrants special attention. In that situation, he is encouraged to forward a litigation report to the Office, Chief of Engineers, ATTN: DAEN-CCK, for direct coordination through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) with the Department of Justice. Further, the case record should not be closed if the district engineer anticipates that further administrative enforcement actions, taken in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this part, will identify remedial measures which, if not complied with by the parties responsible for the violation, will result in appropriate legal action at a later date.

    § 326.6   Class I administrative penalties.

#### § § 326.6

    (a)  (1) This section sets forth procedures for initiation and administration of Class I administrative penalty orders under Section 309(g) of the Clean Water Act, judicially-imposed civil penalties under Section 404(s) of the Clean Water Act, and Section 205 of the National Fishing Enhancement Act. Under Section 309(g)(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act, Class I civil penalties may not exceed $26,686 per violation, except that the maximum amount of any Class I civil penalty shall not exceed $66,713. Under Section 404(s)(4) of the Clean Water Act, judicially-imposed civil penalties may not exceed $66,713 per day for each violation. Under Section 205(e) of the National Fishing Enhancement Act, penalties for violations of permits issued in accordance with that Act shall not exceed $29,211 for each violation.

    (2) These procedures supplement the existing enforcement procedures at §§ 326.1 through 326.5. However, as a matter of Corps enforcement discretion once the Corps decides to proceed with an administrative penalty under these procedures it shall not subsequently pursue judicial action pursuant to § 326.5. Therefore, an administrative penalty should not be pursued if a subsequent judicial action for civil penalties is desired. An administrative civil penalty may be pursued in conjunction with a compliance order; request for restoration and/or request for mitigation issued under § 326.4.

    (3)  For the purposes of this section of the regulation:

    (i)  means the Secretary of the Army, acting through the U.S. Army _Corps_ of Engineers, with respect to the matters covered by this regulation.

    (iii)  means those Corps employees, whether temporary or permanent, who may investigate, litigate, or present evidence, arguments, or the position of the Corps in the hearing or who participated in the preparation, investigation or deliberations concerning the proposed penalty order, including any employee, contractor, or consultant who may be called as a witness.

    (iv)  means the person to whom the Corps issued a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, (or section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act for an Artificial Reef) the conditions and limitations of which permit have allegedly been violated.

    (v)  means a member of Corps Counsel staff or any other qualified person designated by the District Engineer (DE), to hold a hearing on a proposed administrative civil penalty order (hereinafter referred to as “proposed order”) in accordance with the rules set forth in this regulation and to make such recommendations to the DE as prescribed in this regulation.

    (vi)  means any communication, written or oral, relating to the merits of the proceeding, between the Presiding Officer and an interested person outside the Corps or the interested Corps staff, which was not originally filed or stated in the administrative record or in the hearing. Such communication is not an “ex parte communication” if all parties have received prior written notice of the proposed communication and have been given the opportunity to participate herein.

    (b)  (1) If the DE or a delegatee of the DE finds that a recipient of a Department of the Army permit (hereinafter referred to as “the permittee”) has violated any permit condition or limitation contained in that permit, the DE is authorized to prepare and process a proposed order in accordance with these procedures. The proposed order shall specify the amount of the penalty which the permittee may be assessed and shall describe with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation.

    (2) The permittee will be provided actual notice, in writing, of the DE's proposal to issue an administrative civil penalty and will be advised of the right to request a hearing and to present evidence on the alleged violation. Notice to the permittee will be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other notice, at the discretion of the DE when he determines justice so requires. This notice will be accompanied by a copy of the proposed order, and will include the following information:

    (i) A description of the alleged violation and copies of the applicable law and regulations;

    (ii) An explanation of the authority to initiate the proceeding;

    (iii) An explanation, in general terms, of the procedure for assessing civil penalties, including opportunities for public participation;

    (iv) A statement of the amount of the penalty that is proposed and a statement of the maximum amount of the penalty which the DE is authorized to assess for the violations alleged;

    (vi) The name and address of the person to whom the permittee must send a request for hearing;

    (vii) Notification that the DE may issue the final order on or after 30 calendar days following receipt of the notice provided under these rules, if the permittee does not request a hearing; and

    (viii) An explanation that any final order issued under this section shall become effective 30 calendar days following its issuance unless a petition to set aside the order and to hold a hearing is filed by a person who commented on the proposed order and such petition is granted or an appeal is taken under section 309(g)(8) of the Clean Water Act.

    (3) At the same time that actual notice is provided to the permittee, the DE shall give public notice of the proposed order, and provide reasonable opportunity for public comment on the proposed order, prior to issuing a final order assessing an administrative civil penalty.

Any person who comments on a proposed order shall be given notice of any hearing held on the proposed order. Such persons shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence in such hearings.

    (3) If no hearing is requested by the permittee, any person who has submitted comments on the proposed order shall be given notice by the DE of any final order issued, and will be given 30 calendar days in which to petition the DE to set aside the order and to provide a hearing on the penalty. The DE shall set aside the order and provide a hearing in accordance with these rules if the evidence presented by the commenter in support of the commenter's petition for a hearing is material and was not considered when the order was issued. If the DE denies a hearing, the DE shall provide notice to the commenter filing the petition for the hearing, together with the reasons for the denial. Notice of the denial and the reasons for the denial shall be published in the  by the DE.

    (4) The DE shall give public notice by mailing a copy of the information listed in paragraph (c)(5), of this section to:

    (d)  (1) At the same time that the permittee is provided actual notice, the DE shall send the appropriate state agency written notice of proposal to issue an administrative civil penalty order. This notice will include the same information required pursuant to § 326.6(c)(5).

    (2) For the purposes of this regulation, the appropriate State agency will be the agency administering the 401 certification program, unless another state agency is agreed to by the District and the respective state through formal/informal agreement with the state.

    (3) The appropriate state agency will be provided the same opportunity to comment on the proposed order and participate in any hearing that is provided pursuant to § 326.6(c).

    (e)  (1) At any time after the public notice of a proposed penalty order is given under § 326.6(c), the DE shall make available the administrative record at reasonable times for inspection and copying by any interested person, subject to provisions of law restricting the public disclosure of confidential information. Any person requesting copies of the administrative record or portions of the administrative record may be required by the DE to pay reasonable charges for reproducing the information requested.

    (f)  A permittee may be represented at all stages of the proceeding by counsel. After receiving notification that a permittee or any other party or commenter is represented by counsel, the Presiding Officer and DE shall direct all further communications to that counsel.

    (g)  (1) The permittee may request a hearing and may provide written comments on the proposed administrative penalty order at any time within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice set forth in § 326.6(b)(2). The permittee must request the hearing in writing, specifying in summary form the factual and legal issues which are in dispute and the specific factual and legal grounds for the permittee's defense.

    (2) The permittee waives the right to a hearing to present evidence on the alleged violation or violations if the permittee does not submit the request for the hearing to the official designated in the notice of the proposed order within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice. The DE shall determine the date of receipt of notice by permittee's signed and dated return receipt or such other evidence that constitutes proof of actual notice on a certain date.

    (3) The DE shall promptly schedule requested hearings and provide reasonable notice of the hearing schedule to all participants, except that no hearing shall be scheduled prior to the end of the thirty day public comment period provided in § 326.6(c)(2). The DE may grant any delays or continuances necessary or desirable to resolve the case fairly.

    (4) The hearing shall be held at the district office or a location chosen by the DE, except the permittee may request in writing upon a showing of good cause that the hearing be held at an alternative location. Action on such request is at the discretion of the DE.

    (h)  (1) Hearings shall afford permittees with an opportunity to present evidence on alleged violations and shall be informal, adjudicatory hearings and shall not be subject to section 554 or 556 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Permittees may present evidence either orally or in written form in accordance with the hearing procedures specified in § 326.6(i).

    (2) The DE shall give written notice of any hearing to be held under these rules to any person who commented on the proposed administrative penalty order under § 326.6(c). This notice shall specify a reasonable time prior to the hearing within which the commenter may request an opportunity to be heard and to present oral evidence or to make comments in writing in any such hearing. The notice shall require that any such request specify the facts or issues which the commenter wishes to address. Any commenter who files comments pursuant to § 326.6(c)(2) shall have a right to be heard and to present evidence at the hearing in conformance with these procedures.

    (3) The DE shall select a member of the Corps counsel staff or other qualified person to serve as Presiding Officer of the hearing. The Presiding Officer shall exercise no other responsibility, direct or supervisory, for the investigation or prosecution of any case before him.

    (iii) The DE may replace the Presiding Officer in any proceeding in which it is demonstrated to the DE's satisfaction that the Presiding Officer has engaged in prohibited ex parte communications to the prejudice of any participant.

    (iv) Whenever an ex parte communication in violation of this section is received by the Presiding Officer or made known to the Presiding Officer, the Presiding Officer shall immediately notify all participants in the proceeding of the circumstances and substance of the communication and may require the person who made the communication or caused it to be made, or the party whose representative made the communication or caused it to be made, to the extent consistent with justice and the policies of the Clean Water Act, to show cause why that person or party's claim or interest in the proceedings should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.

    (v) The prohibitions of this paragraph apply upon designation of the Presiding Officer and terminate on the date of final action or the final order.

    (i)  (1) The Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial proceeding in which the participants are given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence.

    (2) The Presiding Officer may subpoena witnesses and issue subpoenas for documents pursuant to the provisions of the Clean Water Act.

    (3) The Presiding Officer shall provide interested parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. Interested parties include the permittee, any person who filed a request to participate under 33 CFR 326.6(c), and any other person attending the hearing. The Presiding Officer may establish reasonable time limits for oral testimony.

    (4) The permittee may not challenge the permit condition or limitation which is the subject matter of the administrative penalty order.

    (5) Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the DE shall provide to the Presiding Officer the complete administrative record as of that date. During the hearing, the DE, or an authorized representative of the DE may summarize the basis for the proposed administrative order. Thereafter, the administrative record shall be admitted into evidence and the Presiding Officer shall maintain the administrative record of the proceedings and shall include in that record all documentary evidence, written statements, correspondence, the record of hearing, and any other relevant matter.

    (6) The Presiding Officer shall cause a tape recording, written transcript or other permanent, verbatim record of the hearing to be made, which shall be included in the administrative record, and shall, upon written request, be made available, for inspection or copying, to the permittee or any person, subject to provisions of law restricting the public disclosure of confidential information. Any person making a request may be required to pay reasonable charges for copies of the administrative record or portions thereof.

    (7) In receiving evidence, the Presiding Officer is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The Presiding Officer may determine the weight to be accorded the evidence.

    (8) The permittee has the right to examine, and to respond to the administrative record. The permittee may offer into evidence, in written form or through oral testimony, a response to the administrative record including, any facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on any appropriate issues. The Presiding Officer may question the permittee and require the authentication of any written exhibit or statement. The Presiding Officer may exclude any repetitive or irrelevant matter.

    (9) At the close of the permittee's presentation of evidence, the Presiding Officer should allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Presiding Officer may allow the permittee to respond to any such rebuttal evidence submitted and to cross-examine any witness.

    (10) The Presiding Officer may take official notice of matters that are not reasonably in dispute and are commonly known in the community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known accuracy. Prior to taking official notice of a matter, the Presiding Officer shall give the Corps and the permittee an opportunity to show why such notice should not be taken. In any case in which official notice is taken, the Presiding Officer shall place a written statement of the matters as to which such notice was taken in the record, including the basis for such notice and a statement that the Corps or permittee consented to such notice being taken or a summary of the objections of the Corps or the permittee.

    (11) After all evidence has been presented, any participant may present argument on any relevant issue, subject to reasonable time limitations set at the discretion of the Presiding Officer.

    (12) The hearing record shall remain open for a period of 10 business days from the date of the hearing so that the permittee or any person who has submitted comments on the proposed order may examine and submit responses for the record.

    (13) At the close of this 10 business day period, the Presiding Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Presiding Officer may hold the record open for an additional 10 business days to allow the presentation of such rebuttal evidence.

    (j)  (1) Within a reasonable time following the close of the hearing and receipt of any statements following the hearing and after consultation with the state pursuant to § 326.6(d), the Presiding Officer shall forward a recommended decision accompanied by a written statement of reasons to the DE. The decision shall recommend that the DE withdraw, issue, or modify and issue the proposed order as a final order. The recommended decision shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the administrative record. If the Presiding Officer finds that there is not a preponderance of evidence in the record to support the penalty or the amount of the penalty in a proposed order, the Presiding Officer may recommend that the order be withdrawn or modified and then issued on terms that are supported by a preponderance of evidence on the record. The Presiding Officer also shall make the complete administrative record available to the DE for review.

    (2) The Presiding Officer's recommended decision to the DE shall become part of the administrative record and shall be made available to the parties to the proceeding at the time the DE's decision is released pursuant to § 326.6(j)(5). The Presiding Officer's recommended decision shall not become part of the administrative record until the DE's final decision is issued, and shall not be made available to the permittee or public prior to that time.

    (3) The rules applicable to Presiding Officers under § 326.6(h)(5) regarding ex parte communications are also applicable to the DE and to any person who advises the DE on the decision or the order, except that communications between the DE and the Presiding Officer do not constitute ex parte communications, nor do communications between the DE and his staff prior to issuance of the proposed order.

    (4) The DE may request additional information on specified issues from the participants, in whatever form the DE designates, giving all participants a fair opportunity to be heard on such additional matters. The DE shall include this additional information in the administrative record.

    (5) Within a reasonable time following receipt of the Presiding Officer's recommended decision, the DE shall withdraw, issue, or modify and issue the proposed order as a final order. The DE's decision shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the administrative record, shall consider the penalty factors set out in section 309(g)(3) of the CWA, shall be in writing, shall include a clear and concise statement of reasons for the decision, and shall include any final order assessing a penalty. The DE's decision, once issued, shall constitute final Corps action for purposes of judicial review.

    (6) The DE shall issue the final order by sending the order, or written notice of its withdrawal, to the permittee by certified mail. Issuance of the order under this subparagraph constitutes final Corps action for purposes of judicial review.

    (7) The DE shall provide written notice of the issuance, modification and issuance, or withdrawal of the proposed order to every person who submitted written comments on the proposed order.

    (8) The notice shall include a statement of the right to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for obtaining judicial review. The notice shall also note the right of a commenter to petition for a hearing pursuant to 33 CFR 326.6(c)(3) if no hearing was previously held.

    (k)  (1) Any final order issued under this subpart shall become effective 30 calendar days following its issuance unless an appeal is taken pursuant to section 309(g)(8) of the Clean Water Act, or in the case where no hearing was held prior to the final order, and a petition for hearing is filed by a prior commenter.

    (2) If a petition for hearing is received within 30 days after the final order is issued, the DE shall:

    (i) Review the evidence presented by the petitioner.

    (ii) If the evidence is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order, the DE shall immediately set aside the final order and schedule a hearing. In that case, a hearing will be held, a new recommendation will be made by the Presiding Officer to the DE and a new final decision issued by the DE.

    (iii) If the DE denies a hearing under this subparagraph, the DE shall provide to the petitioner, and publish in the  notice of, and the reasons for, such denial.

    (l)  (1) Any permittee against whom a final order assessing a civil penalty under these regulations or any person who provided written comments on a proposed order may obtain judicial review of the final order.

    (2) In order to obtain judicial review, the permittee or commenter must file a notice of appeal in the United States District Court for either the District of Columbia, or the district in which the violation was alleged to have occurred, within 30 calendar days after the date of issuance of the final order.

    (3) Simultaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal, the permittee or commenter must send a copy of such notice by certified mail to the DE and the Attorney General.

#### § § 327.3

    (a)  means a public proceeding conducted for the purpose of acquiring information or evidence which will be considered in evaluating a proposed DA permit action, or Federal project, and which affords the public an opportunity to present their views, opinions, and information on such permit actions or Federal projects.

    (b)  as used herein means the evaluation of and decision on an application for a DA permit pursuant to sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or section 103 of the MPRSA, as amended, or the modification, suspension or revocation of any DA permit (see 33 CFR 325.7).

    (c)  means a Corps of Engineers project (work or activity of any nature for any purpose which is to be performed by the Chief of Engineers pursuant to Congressional authorizations) involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or section 103 of the MPRSA.

    § 327.4   General policies.

#### § § 327.4

    (a) A public hearing will be held in connection with the consideration of a DA permit application or a Federal project whenever a public hearing is needed for making a decision on such permit application or Federal project. In addition, a public hearing may be held when it is proposed to modify or revoke a permit. (See 33 CFR 325.7).

    (b) Unless the public notice specifies that a public hearing will be held, any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in the public notice on a DA permit application or on a Federal project, that a public hearing be held to consider the material matters at issue in the permit application or with respect to Federal project. Upon receipt of any such request, stating with particularity the reasons for holding a public hearing, the district engineer may expeditiously attempt to resolve the issues informally. Otherwise, he shall promptly set a time and place for the public hearing, and give due notice thereof, as prescribed in § 327.11 of this part. Requests for a public hearing under this paragraph shall be granted, unless the district engineer determines that the issues raised are insubstantial or there is otherwise no valid interest to be served by a hearing. The district engineer will make such a determination in writing, and communicate his reasons therefor to all requesting parties. Comments received as form letters or petitions may be acknowledged as a group to the person or organization responsible for the form letter or petition.

    (c) In case of doubt, a public hearing shall be held. HQDA has the discretionary power to require hearings in any case.

    (d) In fixing the time and place for a hearing, the convenience and necessity of the interested public will be duly considered.

    § 327.5   Presiding officer.

#### § § 327.5

    (a) The district engineer, in whose district a matter arises, shall normally serve as the presiding officer. When the district engineer is unable to serve, he may designate the deputy district engineer or other qualified person as presiding officer. In cases of unusual interest, the Chief of Engineers or the division engineer may appoint such person as he deems appropriate to serve as the presiding officer.

    (b) The presiding officer shall include in the administrative record of the permit action the request or requests for the hearing and any data or material submitted in justification thereof, materials submitted in opposition to or in support of the proposed action, the hearing transcript, and such other material as may be relevant or pertinent to the subject matter of the hearing.

  PART 328—DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Part 328

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1251

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41250, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 328.1   Purpose.

#### § § 328.1

    This section defines the term “waters of the United States” as it applies to the jurisdictional limits of the authority of the Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act. It prescribes the policy, practice, and procedures to be used in determining the extent of jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers concerning “waters of the United States.” The terminology used by section 404 of the Clean Water Act includes “navigable waters” which is defined at section 502(7) of the Act as “waters of the United States including the territorial seas.” To provide clarity and to avoid confusion with other Corps of Engineer regulatory programs, the term “waters of the United States” is used throughout 33 CFR parts 320 through 330. This section does not apply to authorities under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 except that some of the same waters may be regulated under both statutes (see 33 CFR parts 322 and 329).

    § 328.2   General scope.

#### § § 328.2

    Waters of the United States include those waters listed in § 328.3(a). The lateral limits of jurisdiction in those waters may be divided into three categories. The categories include the territorial seas, tidal waters, and non-tidal waters (see 33 CFR 328.4 (a), (b), and (c), respectively).

    § 328.3   Definitions.

#### § § 328.3

    For the purpose of this regulation these terms are defined as follows:

    (a)  means:

    (1) Waters which are:

    (i) Currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide;

    (ii) The territorial seas; or

    (iii) Interstate waters;

    (2) Impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters of the United States under this definition, other than impoundments of waters identified under paragraph (a)(5) of this section;

    (3) Tributaries of waters identified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section that are relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water;

    (4) Wetlands adjacent to the following waters:

    (i) Waters identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

    (ii) Relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water identified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section and with a continuous surface connection to those waters;

    (5) Intrastate lakes and ponds not identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section that are relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water with a continuous surface connection to the waters identified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section.

    (b) The following are not “waters of the United States” even where they otherwise meet the terms of paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section:

    (1) Waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or lagoons, designed to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act;

    (2) Prior converted cropland designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. The exclusion would cease upon a change of use, which means that the area is no longer available for the production of agricultural commodities. Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior converted cropland by any other Federal agency, for the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the final authority regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction remains with EPA;

    (3) Ditches (including roadside ditches) excavated wholly in and draining only dry land and that do not carry a relatively permanent flow of water;

    (4) Artificially irrigated areas that would revert to dry land if the irrigation ceased;

    (5) Artificial lakes or ponds created by excavating or diking dry land to collect and retain water and which are used exclusively for such purposes as stock watering, irrigation, settling basins, or rice growing;

    (6) Artificial reflecting or swimming pools or other small ornamental bodies of water created by excavating or diking dry land to retain water for primarily aesthetic reasons;

    (7) Waterfilled depressions created in dry land incidental to construction activity and pits excavated in dry land for the purpose of obtaining fill, sand, or gravel unless and until the construction or excavation operation is abandoned and the resulting body of water meets the definition of waters of the United States; and

    (8) Swales and erosional features ( gullies, small washes) characterized by low volume, infrequent, or short duration flow.

    (c) In this section, the following definitions apply:

    (1)  means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. _Wetlands_ generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

    (2)  means having a continuous surface connection.

    (3)  means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.

    (4)  means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.

    (5)  means those waters that rise and fall in a predictable and measurable rhythm or cycle due to the gravitational pulls of the moon and sun. _Tidal waters_ end where the rise and fall of the water surface can no longer be practically measured in a predictable rhythm due to masking by hydrologic, wind, or other effects.

> [88 FR 3142, Jan. 18, 2023, as amended at 88 FR 61968, Sept. 8, 2023]

    § 328.4   Limits of jurisdiction.

#### § § 328.4

    (a)  The limit of jurisdiction in the territorial seas is measured from the baseline in a seaward direction a distance of three nautical miles. (See 33 CFR 329.12)

    (b)  The landward limits of jurisdiction in tidal waters:

    (1) Extends to the high tide line, or

    (2) When adjacent non-tidal waters of the United States are present, the jurisdiction extends to the limits identified in paragraph (c) of this section.

    (c)  The limits of jurisdiction in non-tidal waters:

    (1) In the absence of adjacent wetlands, the jurisdiction extends to the ordinary high water mark, or

    (2) When adjacent wetlands are present, the jurisdiction extends beyond the ordinary high water mark to the limit of the adjacent wetlands.

    (3) When the water of the United States consists only of wetlands the jurisdiction extends to the limit of the wetland.

    § 328.5   Changes in limits of waters of the United States.

#### § § 328.5

    Permanent changes of the shoreline configuration result in similar alterations of the boundaries of waters of the United States. Gradual changes which are due to natural causes and are perceptible only over some period of time constitute changes in the bed of a waterway which also change the boundaries of the waters of the United States. For example, changing sea levels or subsidence of land may cause some areas to become waters of the United States while siltation or a change in drainage may remove an area from waters of the United States. Man-made changes may affect the limits of waters of the United States; however, permanent changes should not be presumed until the particular circumstances have been examined and verified by the district engineer. Verification of changes to the lateral limits of jurisdiction may be obtained from the district engineer.

  PART 329—DEFINITION OF NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Part 329

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401

**Source:** Source: 51 FR 41251, Nov. 13, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    § 329.1   Purpose.

#### § § 329.1

    This regulation defines the term “navigable waters of the United States” as it is used to define authorities of the Corps of Engineers. It also prescribes the policy, practice and procedure to be used in determining the extent of the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers and in answering inquiries concerning “navigable waters of the United States.” This definition does not apply to authorities under the Clean Water Act which definitions are described under 33 CFR parts 323 and 328.

    § 329.2   Applicability.

#### § § 329.2

    This regulation is applicable to all Corps of Engineers districts and divisions having civil works responsibilities.

    § 329.3   General policies.

#### § § 329.3

    Precise definitions of “navigable waters of the United States” or “navigability” are ultimately dependent on judicial interpretation and cannot be made conclusively by administrative agencies. However, the policies and criteria contained in this regulation are in close conformance with the tests used by Federal courts and determinations made under this regulation are considered binding in regard to the activities of the Corps of Engineers.

    § 329.4   General definition.

#### § § 329.4

    Navigable waters of the United States are those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce. A determination of navigability, once made, applies laterally over the entire surface of the waterbody, and is not extinguished by later actions or events which impede or destroy navigable capacity.

    § 329.5   General scope of determination.

#### § § 329.5

    The several factors which must be examined when making a determination whether a waterbody is a navigable water of the United States are discussed in detail below. Generally, the following conditions must be satisfied:

    (a) Past, present, or potential presence of interstate or foreign commerce;

    (b) Physical capabilities for use by commerce as in paragraph (a) of this section; and

    (c) Defined geographic limits of the waterbody.

    § 329.6   Interstate or foreign commerce.

#### § § 329.6

    (a)  The types of commercial use of a waterway are extremely varied and will depend on the character of the region, its products, and the difficulties or dangers of navigation. It is the waterbody's capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation of commerce which is the determinative factor, and not the time, extent or manner of that use. As discussed in § 329.9 of this part, it is sufficient to establish the potential for commercial use at any past, present, or future time. Thus, sufficient commerce may be shown by historical use of canoes, bateaux, or other frontier craft, as long as that type of boat was common or well-suited to the place and period. Similarly, the particular items of commerce may vary widely, depending again on the region and period. The goods involved might be grain, furs, or other commerce of the time. Logs are a common example; transportation of logs has been a substantial and well-recognized commercial use of many navigable waters of the United States. Note, however, that the mere presence of floating logs will not of itself make the river “navigable”; the logs must have been related to a commercial venture. Similarly, the presence of recreational craft may indicate that a waterbody is capable of bearing some forms of commerce, either presently, in the future, or at a past point in time.

    (b)  Interstate commerce may of course be existent on an intrastate voyage which occurs only between places within the same state. It is only necessary that goods may be brought from, or eventually be destined to go to, another state. (For purposes of this regulation, the term “interstate commerce” hereinafter includes “foreign commerce” as well.)

    § 329.7   Intrastate or interstate nature of waterway.

#### § § 329.7

    A waterbody may be entirely within a state, yet still be capable of carrying interstate commerce. This is especially clear when it physically connects with a generally acknowledged avenue of interstate commerce, such as the ocean or one of the Great Lakes, and is yet wholly within one state. Nor is it necessary that there be a physically navigable connection across a state boundary. Where a waterbody extends through one or more states, but substantial portions, which are capable of bearing interstate commerce, are located in only one of the states, the entirety of the waterway up to the head (upper limit) of navigation is subject to Federal jurisdiction.

    § 329.8   Improved or natural conditions of the waterbody.

#### § § 329.8

    Determinations are not limited to the natural or original condition of the waterbody. Navigability may also be found where artificial aids have been or may be used to make the waterbody suitable for use in navigation.

    (a)  (1) An artificial channel may often constitute a navigable water of the United States, even though it has been privately developed and maintained, or passes through private property. The test is generally as developed above, that is, whether the waterbody is capable of use to transport interstate commerce. Canals which connect two navigable waters of the United States and which are used for commerce clearly fall within the test, and themselves become navigable. A canal open to navigable waters of the United States on only one end is itself navigable where it in fact supports interstate commerce. A canal or other artificial waterbody that is subject to ebb and flow of the tide is also a navigable water of the United States.

    (2) The artificial waterbody may be a major portion of a river or harbor area or merely a minor backwash, slip, or turning area (see § 329.12(b) of this part).

    (3) Private ownership of the lands underlying the waterbody, or of the lands through which it runs, does not preclude a finding of navigability. Ownership does become a controlling factor if a privately constructed and operated canal is not used to transport interstate commerce nor used by the public; it is then not considered to be a navigable water of the United States. However, a private waterbody, even though not itself navigable, may so affect the navigable capacity of nearby waters as to nevertheless be subject to certain regulatory authorities.

    (b)  A waterbody may also be considered navigable depending on the feasibility of use to transport interstate commerce after the construction of whatever “reasonable” improvements may potentially be made. The improvement need not exist, be planned, nor even authorized; it is enough that potentially they could be made. What is a “reasonable” improvement is always a matter of degree; there must be a balance between cost and need at a time when the improvement would be (or would have been) useful. Thus, if an improvement were “reasonable” at a time of past use, the water was therefore navigable in law from that time forward. The changes in engineering practices or the coming of new industries with varying classes of freight may affect the type of the improvement; those which may be entirely reasonable in a thickly populated, highly developed industrial region may have been entirely too costly for the same region in the days of the pioneers. The determination of reasonable improvement is often similar to the cost analyses presently made in Corps of Engineers studies.

    § 329.9   Time at which commerce exists or determination is made.

#### § § 329.9

    (a)  A waterbody which was navigable in its natural or improved state, or which was susceptible of reasonable improvement (as discussed in § 329.8(b) of this part) retains its character as “navigable in law” even though it is not presently used for commerce, or is presently incapable of such use because of changed conditions or the presence of obstructions. Nor does absence of use because of changed economic conditions affect the legal character of the waterbody. Once having attained the character of “navigable in law,” the Federal authority remains in existence, and cannot be abandoned by administrative officers or court action. Nor is mere inattention or ambiguous action by Congress an abandonment of Federal control. However, express statutory declarations by Congress that described portions of a waterbody are non-navigable, or have been abandoned, are binding upon the Department of the Army. Each statute must be carefully examined, since Congress often reserves the power to amend the Act, or assigns special duties of supervision and control to the Secretary of the Army or Chief of Engineers.

    (b)  Navigability may also be found in a waterbody's susceptibility for use in its ordinary condition or by reasonable improvement to transport interstate commerce. This may be either in its natural or improved condition, and may thus be existent although there has been no actual use to date. Non-use in the past therefore does not prevent recognition of the potential for future use.

    § 329.10   Existence of obstructions.

#### § § 329.10

    A stream may be navigable despite the existence of falls, rapids, sand bars, bridges, portages, shifting currents, or similar obstructions. Thus, a waterway in its original condition might have had substantial obstructions which were overcome by frontier boats and/or portages, and nevertheless be a “channel” of commerce, even though boats had to be removed from the water in some stretches, or logs be brought around an obstruction by means of artificial chutes. However, the question is ultimately a matter of degree, and it must be recognized that there is some point beyond which navigability could not be established.

    § 329.11   Geographic and jurisdictional limits of rivers and lakes.

#### § § 329.11

    (a)  Federal regulatory jurisdiction, and powers of improvement for navigation, extend laterally to the entire water surface and bed of a navigable waterbody, which includes all the land and waters below the ordinary high water mark. Jurisdiction thus extends to the edge (as determined above) of all such waterbodies, even though portions of the waterbody may be extremely shallow, or obstructed by shoals, vegetation or other barriers. Marshlands and similar areas are thus considered navigable in law, but only so far as the area is subject to inundation by the ordinary high waters.

    (1) The “ordinary high water mark” on non-tidal rivers is the line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; shelving; changes in the character of soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; the presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.

    (2) Ownership of a river or lake bed or of the lands between high and low water marks will vary according to state law; however, private ownership of the underlying lands has no bearing on the existence or extent of the dominant Federal jurisdiction over a navigable waterbody.

    (b)  The character of a river will, at some point along its length, change from navigable to non-navigable. Very often that point will be at a major fall or rapids, or other place where there is a marked decrease in the navigable capacity of the river. The upper limit will therefore often be the same point traditionally recognized as the head of navigation, but may, under some of the tests described above, be at some point yet farther upstream.

    § 329.12   Geographic and jurisdictional limits of oceanic and tidal waters.

#### § § 329.12

    (a)  The navigable waters of the United States over which Corps of Engineers regulatory jurisdiction extends include all ocean and coastal waters within a zone three geographic (nautical) miles seaward from the baseline (The Territorial Seas). Wider zones are recognized for special regulatory powers exercised over the outer continental shelf. (See 33 CFR 322.3(b)).

    (1)  Generally, where the shore directly contacts the open sea, the line on the shore reached by the ordinary low tides comprises the baseline from which the distance of three geographic miles is measured. The baseline has significance for both domestic and international law and is subject to precise definitions. Special problems arise when offshore rocks, islands, or other bodies exist, and the baseline may have to be drawn seaward of such bodies.

    (2)  Regulatory jurisdiction in coastal areas extends to the line on the shore reached by the plane of the mean (average) high water. Where precise determination of the actual location of the line becomes necessary, it must be established by survey with reference to the available tidal datum, preferably averaged over a period of 18.6 years. Less precise methods, such as observation of the “apparent shoreline” which is determined by reference to physical markings, lines of vegetation, or changes in type of vegetation, may be used only where an estimate is needed of the line reached by the mean high water.

    (b)  Regulatory jurisdiction extends to the entire surface and bed of all waterbodies subject to tidal action. Jurisdiction thus extends to the edge (as determined by paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of all such waterbodies, even though portions of the waterbody may be extremely shallow, or obstructed by shoals, vegetation, or other barriers. Marshlands and similar areas are thus considered “navigable in law,” but only so far as the area is subject to inundation by the mean high waters. The relevant test is therefore the presence of the mean high tidal waters, and not the general test described above, which generally applies to inland rivers and lakes.

    § 329.13   Geographic limits: Shifting boundaries.

#### § § 329.13

    Permanent changes of the shoreline configuration result in similar alterations of the boundaries of the navigable waters of the United States. Thus, gradual changes which are due to natural causes and are perceptible only over some period of time constitute changes in the bed of a waterbody which also change the shoreline boundaries of the navigable waters of the United States. However, an area will remain “navigable in law,” even though no longer covered with water, whenever the change has occurred suddenly, or was caused by artificial forces intended to produce that change. For example, shifting sand bars within a river or estuary remain part of the navigable water of the United States, regardless that they may be dry at a particular point in time.

    § 329.14   Determination of navigability.

#### § § 329.14

    (a)  Although conclusive determinations of navigability can be made only by federal Courts, those made by federal agencies are nevertheless accorded substantial weight by the courts. It is therefore necessary that when jurisdictional questions arise, district personnel carefully investigate those waters which may be subject to Federal regulatory jurisdiction under guidelines set out above, as the resulting determination may have substantial impact upon a judicial body. Official determinations by an agency made in the past can be revised or reversed as necessary to reflect changed rules or interpretations of the law.

    (b)  A determination whether a waterbody is a navigable water of the United States will be made by the division engineer, and will be based on a report of findings prepared at the district level in accordance with the criteria set out in this regulation. Each report of findings will be prepared by the district engineer, accompanied by an opinion of the district counsel, and forwarded to the division engineer for final determination. Each report of findings will be based substantially on applicable portions of the format in paragraph (c) of this section.

    § 329.15   Inquiries regarding determinations.

#### § § 329.15

    (a) Findings and determinations should be made whenever a question arises regarding the navigability of a waterbody. Where no determination has been made, a report of findings will be prepared and forwarded to the division engineer, as described above. Inquiries may be answered by an interim reply which indicates that a final agency determination must be made by the division engineer. If a need develops for an emergency determination, district engineers may act in reliance on a finding prepared as in section 329.14 of this part. The report of findings should then be forwarded to the division engineer on an expedited basis.

    (b) Where determinations have been made by the division engineer, inquiries regarding the  of specific portions of waterbodies covered by these determinations may be answered as follows:

    This Department, in the administration of the laws enacted by Congress for the protection and preservation of the navigable waters of the United States, has determined that ___ (River) (Bay) (Lake, etc.) is a navigable water of the United States from ___ to ___. Actions which modify or otherwise affect those waters are subject to the jurisdiction of this Department, whether such actions occur within or outside the navigable areas.

    (c) Specific inquiries regarding the  of the Corps of Engineers can be answered only after a determination whether (1) the waters are navigable waters of the United States or

    (2) If not navigable, whether the proposed type of activity may nevertheless so affect the navigable waters of the United States that the assertion of regulatory jurisdiction is deemed necessary.

    § 329.16   Use and maintenance of lists of determinations.

#### § § 329.16

    (a) Tabulated lists of final determinations of navigability are to be maintained in each district office, and be updated as necessitated by court decisions, jurisdictional inquiries, or other changed conditions.

    (b) It should be noted that the lists represent only those waterbodies for which determinations have been made; absence from that list should not be taken as an indication that the waterbody is not navigable.

    (c) Deletions from the list are not authorized. If a change in status of a waterbody from navigable to non-navigable is deemed necessary, an updated finding should be forwarded to the division engineer; changes are not considered final until a determination has been made by the division engineer.

  PART 330—NATIONWIDE PERMIT PROGRAM

### Part 330

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401  33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 U.S.C. 1413.

**Source:** Source: 56 FR 59134, Nov. 22, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

    § 330.1   Purpose and policy.

#### § § 330.1

    (a)  This part describes the policy and procedures used in the Department of the Army's nationwide permit program to issue, modify, suspend, or revoke nationwide permits; to identify conditions, limitations, and restrictions on the nationwide permits; and, to identify any procedures, whether required or optional, for authorization by nationwide permits.

    (b)  Nationwide permits (NWPs) are a type of general permit issued by the Chief of Engineers and are designed to regulate with little, if any, delay or paperwork certain activities having minimal impacts. The NWPs are proposed, issued, modified, reissued (extended), and revoked from time to time after an opportunity for public notice and comment. Proposed NWPs or modifications to or reissuance of existing NWPs will be adopted only after the Corps gives notice and allows the public an opportunity to comment on and request a public hearing regarding the proposals. The Corps will give full consideration to all comments received prior to reaching a final decision.

    (c)  An activity is authorized under an NWP only if that activity and the permittee satisfy all of the NWP's terms and conditions. Activities that do not qualify for authorization under an NWP still may be authorized by an individual or regional general permit. The Corps will consider unauthorized any activity requiring Corps authorization if that activity is under construction or completed and does not comply with all of the terms and conditions of an NWP, regional general permit, or an individual permit. The Corps will evaluate unauthorized activities for enforcement action under 33 CFR part 326. The district engineer (DE) may elect to suspend enforcement proceedings if the permittee modifies his project to comply with an NWP or a regional general permit. After considering whether a violation was knowing or intentional, and other indications of the need for a penalty, the DE can elect to terminate an enforcement proceeding with an after-the-fact authorization under an NWP, if all terms and conditions of the NWP have been satisfied, either before or after the activity has been accomplished.

    (d)  District and division engineers have been delegated a discretionary authority to suspend, modify, or revoke authorizations under an NWP. This discretionary authority may be used by district and division engineers only to further condition or restrict the applicability of an NWP for cases where they have concerns for the aquatic environment under the Clean Water Act section 404(b)(1) Guidelines or for any factor of the public interest. Because of the nature of most activities authorized by NWP, district and division engineers will not have to review every such activity to decide whether to exercise discretionary authority. The terms and conditions of certain NWPs require the DE to review the proposed activity before the NWP authorizes its construction. However, the DE has the discretionary authority to review any activity authorized by NWP to determine whether the activity complies with the NWP. If the DE finds that the proposed activity would have more than minimal individual or cumulative net adverse effects on the environment or otherwise may be contrary to the public interest, he shall modify the NWP authorization to reduce or eliminate those adverse effects, or he shall instruct the prospective permittee to apply for a regional general permit or an individual permit. Discretionary authority is also discussed at 33 CFR 330.4(e) and 330.5.

    (e)  (1) In most cases, permittees may proceed with activities authorized by NWPs without notifying the DE. However, the prospective permittee should carefully review the language of the NWP to ascertain whether he must notify the DE prior to commencing the authorized activity. For NWPs requiring advance notification, such notification must be made in writing as early as possible prior to commencing the proposed activity. The permittee may presume that his project qualifies for the NWP unless he is otherwise notified by the DE within a 45-day period. The 45-day period starts on the date of receipt of the notification in the Corps district office and ends 45 calendar days later regardless of weekends or holidays. If the DE notifies the prospective permittee that the notification is incomplete, a new 45-day period will commence upon receipt of the revised notification. The prospective permittee may not proceed with the proposed activity before expiration of the 45-day period unless otherwise notified by the DE. If the DE fails to act within the 45-day period, he must use the procedures of 33 CFR 330.5 in order to modify, suspend, or revoke the NWP authorization.

    (2) The DE will review the notification and may add activity-specific conditions to ensure that the activity complies with the terms and conditions of the NWP and that the adverse impacts on the aquatic environment and other aspects of the public interest are individually and cumulatively minimal.

    (3) For some NWPs involving discharges into wetlands, the notification must include a wetland delineation. The DE will review the notification and determine if the individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects are more than minimal. If the adverse effects are more than minimal the DE will notify the prospective permittee that an individual permit is required or that the prospective permittee may propose measures to mitigate the loss of special aquatic sites, including wetlands, to reduce the adverse impacts to minimal. The prospective permittee may elect to propose mitigation with the original notification. The DE will consider that proposed mitigation when deciding if the impacts are minimal. The DE shall add activity-specific conditions to ensure that the mitigation will be accomplished. If sufficient mitigation cannot be developed to reduce the adverse environmental effects to the minimal level, the DE will not allow authorization under the NWP and will instruct the prospective permittee on procedures to seek authorization under an individual permit.

    (f)  DEs should review all incoming applications for individual permits for possible eligibility under regional general permits or NWPs. If the activity complies with the terms and conditions of one or more NWP, he should verify the authorization and so notify the applicant. If the DE determines that the activity could comply after reasonable project modifications and/or activity-specific conditions, he should notify the applicant of such modifications and conditions. If such modifications and conditions are accepted by the applicant, verbally or in writing, the DE will verify the authorization with the modifications and conditions in accordance with 33 CFR 330.6(a). However, the DE will proceed with processing the application as an individual permit and take the appropriate action within 15 calendar days of receipt, in accordance with 33 CFR 325.2(a)(2), unless the applicant indicates that he will accept the modifications or conditions.

    (g)  NWPs can be issued to satisfy the permit requirements of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section 404 of the Clean Water Act, section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, or some combination thereof. The applicable authority will be indicated at the end of each NWP. NWPs and their conditions previously published at 33 CFR 330.5 and 330.6 will remain in effect until they expire or are modified or revoked in accordance with the procedures of this part.

> [56 FR 59134, Nov. 22, 1991, as amended at 78 FR 5733, Jan. 28, 2013]

    § 330.2   Definitions.

#### § § 330.2

    (a) The definitions found in 33 CFR parts 320-329 are applicable to the terms used in this part.

    (b)  permit refers to a type of general permit which authorizes activities on a nationwide basis unless specifically limited. (Another type of general permit is a “regional permit” which is issued by division or district engineers on a regional basis in accordance with 33 CFR part 325). (See 33 CFR 322.2(f) and 323.2(h) for the definition of a general permit.)

    (c)  means that specific activities that qualify for an NWP may proceed, provided that the terms and conditions of the NWP are met. After determining that the activity complies with all applicable terms and conditions, the prospective permittee may assume an authorization under an NWP. This assumption is subject to the DE's authority to determine if an activity complies with the terms and conditions of an NWP. If requested by the permittee in writing, the DE will verify in writing that the permittee's proposed activity complies with the terms and conditions of the NWP. A written verification may contain activity-specific conditions and regional conditions which a permittee must satisfy for the authorization to be valid.

    (d)  means non-tidal rivers, streams, and their lakes and impoundments, including adjacent wetlands, that are part of a surface tributary system to an interstate or navigable water of the United States upstream of the point on the river or stream at which the average annual flow is less than five cubic feet per second. The DE may estimate this point from available data by using the mean annual area precipitation, area drainage basin maps, and the average runoff coefficient, or by similar means. For streams that are dry for long periods of the year, DEs may establish the point where headwaters begin as that point on the stream where a flow of five cubic feet per second is equaled or exceeded 50 percent of the time.

    (e)  means those non-tidal waters of the United States that are:

    (1) Not part of a surface tributary system to interstate or navigable waters of the United States; and

    (2) Not adjacent to such tributary waterbodies.

    (f)  means the area within jurisdictional waters which is eliminated or covered as a direct result of the discharge (, the area actually covered by the discharged material). It does not include areas excavated nor areas impacted as an indirect effect of the fill.

    (g)  means the authority described in §§ 330.1(d) and 330.4(e) which the Chief of Engineers delegates to division or district engineers to modify an NWP authorization by adding conditions, to suspend an NWP authorization, or to revoke an NWP authorization and thus require individual permit authorization.

    (h)  The “terms” of an NWP are the limitations and provisions included in the description of the NWP itself. The “conditions” of NWPs are additional provisions which place restrictions or limitations on all of the NWPs. These are published with the NWPs. Other conditions may be imposed by district or division engineers on a geographic, category-of-activity, or activity-specific basis (See 33 CFR 330.4(e)).

    (i)  means the total project proposed or accomplished by one owner/developer or partnership or other association of owners/developers. For example, if construction of a residential development affects several different areas of a headwater or isolated water, or several different headwaters or isolated waters, the cumulative total of all filled areas should be the basis for deciding whether or not the project will be covered by an NWP. For linear projects, the “single and complete project” (, single and complete crossing) will apply to each crossing of a separate water of the United States (, single waterbody) at that location; except that for linear projects crossing a single waterbody several times at separate and distant locations, each crossing is considered a single and complete project. However, individual channels in a braided stream or river, or individual arms of a large, irregularly-shaped wetland or lake, etc., are not separate waterbodies.

    (j)  means wetlands, mudflats, vegetated shallows, coral reefs, riffle and pool complexes, sanctuaries, and refuges as defined at 40 CFR 230.40 through 230.45.

    § 330.3   Activities occurring before certain dates.

#### § § 330.3

    The following activities were permitted by NWPs issued on July 19, 1977, and, unless the activities are modified, they do not require further permitting:

    (a) Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States outside the limits of navigable waters of the United States that occurred before the phase-in dates which extended Section 404 jurisdiction to all waters of the United States. The phase-in dates were: After July 25, 1975, discharges into navigable waters of the United States and adjacent wetlands; after September 1, 1976, discharges into navigable waters of the United States and their primary tributaries, including adjacent wetlands, and into natural lakes, greater than 5 acres in surface area; and after July 1, 1977, discharges into all waters of the United States, including wetlands. (section 404)

    (b) Structures or work completed before December 18, 1968, or in waterbodies over which the DE had not asserted jurisdiction at the time the activity occurred, provided in both instances, there is no interference with navigation. Activities completed shoreward of applicable Federal Harbor lines before May 27, 1970 do not require specific authorization. (section 10)

    § 330.4   Conditions, limitations, and restrictions.

#### § § 330.4

    (a)  A prospective permittee must satisfy all terms and conditions of an NWP for a valid authorization to occur. Some conditions identify a “threshold” that, if met, requires additional procedures or provisions contained in other paragraphs in this section. It is important to remember that the NWPs only authorize activities from the perspective of the Corps regulatory authorities and that other Federal, state, and local permits, approvals, or authorizations may also be required.

    (b)  (1) DEs have authority to determine if an activity complies with the terms and conditions of an NWP.

    (2) NWPs do not obviate the need to obtain other Federal, state, or local permits, approvals, or authorizations required by law.

    (3) NWPs do not grant any property rights or exclusive privileges.

    (4) NWPs do not authorize any injury to the property or rights of others.

    (5) NWPs do not authorize interference with any existing or proposed Federal project.

    (c)  (1) State 401 water quality certification pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act, or waiver thereof, is required prior to the issuance or reissuance of NWPs authorizing activities which may result in a discharge into waters of the United States.

    (2) If, prior to the issuance or reissuance of such NWPs, a state issues a 401 water quality certification which includes special conditions, the division engineer will make these special conditions regional conditions of the NWP for activities which may result in a discharge into waters of United States in that state, unless he determines that such conditions do not comply with the provisions of 33 CFR 325.4. In the latter case, the conditioned 401 water quality certification will be considered a denial of the certification (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).

    (3) If a state denies a required 401 water quality certification for an activity otherwise meeting the terms and conditions of a particular NWP, that NWP's authorization for all such activities within that state is denied without prejudice until the state issues an individual 401 water quality certification or waives its right to do so. State denial of 401 water quality certification for any specific NWP affects only those activities which may result in a discharge. That NWP continues to authorize activities which could not reasonably be expected to result in discharges into waters of the United States.

    (4) DEs will take appropriate measures to inform the public of which activities, waterbodies, or regions require an individual 401 water quality certification before authorization by NWP.

    (5) The DE will not require or process an individual permit application for an activity which may result in a discharge and otherwise qualifies for an NWP solely on the basis that the 401 water quality certification has been denied for that NWP. However, the district or division engineer may consider water quality, among other appropriate factors, in determining whether to exercise his discretionary authority and require a regional general permit or an individual permit.

    (6) In instances where a state has denied the 401 water quality certification for discharges under a particular NWP, permittees must furnish the DE with an individual 401 water quality certification or a copy of the application to the state for such certification. For NWPs for which a state has denied the 401 water quality certification, the DE will determine a reasonable period of time after receipt of the request for an activity-specific 401 water quality certification (generally 60 days), upon the expiration of which the DE will presume state waiver of the certification for the individual activity covered by the NWPs. However, the DE and the state may negotiate for additional time for the 401 water quality certification, but in no event shall the period exceed one (1) year (see 33 CFR 325.2(b)(1)(ii)). Upon receipt of an individual 401 water quality certification, or if the prospective permittee demonstrates to the DE state waiver of such certification, the proposed work can be authorized under the NWP. For NWPs requiring a 45-day pre-construction notification the district engineer will immediately begin, and complete, his review prior to the state action on the individual section 401 water quality certification. If a state issues a conditioned individual 401 water quality certification for an individual activity, the DE will include those conditions as activity-specific conditions of the NWP.

    (7) Where a state, after issuing a 401 water quality certification for an NWP, subsequently attempts to withdraw it for substantive reasons after the effective date of the NWP, the division engineer will review those reasons and consider whether there is substantial basis for suspension, modification, or revocation of the NWP authorization as outlined in § 330.5. Otherwise, such attempted state withdrawal is not effective and the Corps will consider the state certification to be valid for the NWP authorizations until such time as the NWP is modified or reissued.

    (d)  (1) Section 307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires the Corps to provide a consistency determination and receive state agreement prior to the issuance, reissuance, or expansion of activities authorized by an NWP that authorizes activities within a state with a Federally-approved Coastal Management Program when activities that would occur within, or outside, that state's coastal zone will affect land or water uses or natural resources of the state's coastal zone.

    (2) If, prior to the issuance, reissuance, or expansion of activities authorized by an NWP, a state indicates that additional conditions are necessary for the state to agree with the Corps consistency determination, the division engineer will make such conditions regional conditions for the NWP in that state, unless he determines that the conditions do not comply with the provisions of 33 CFR 325.4 or believes for some other specific reason it would be inappropriate to include the conditions. In this case, the state's failure to agree with the Corps consistency determination without the conditions will be considered to be a disagreement with the Corps consistency determination.

    (3) When a state has disagreed with the Corps consistency determination, authorization for all such activities occurring within or outside the state's coastal zone that affect land or water uses or natural resources of the state's coastal zone is denied without prejudice until the prospective permittee furnishes the DE an individual consistency certification pursuant to section 307(c)(3) of the CZMA and demonstrates that the state has concurred in it (either on an individual or generic basis), or that concurrence should be presumed (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).

    (4) DEs will take appropriate measures, such as public notices, to inform the public of which activities, waterbodies, or regions require prospective permittees to make an individual consistency determination and seek concurrence from the state.

    (5) DEs will not require or process an individual permit application for an activity otherwise qualifying for an NWP solely on the basis that the activity has not received CZMA consistency agreement from the state. However, the district or division engineer may consider that factor, among other appropriate factors, in determining whether to exercise his discretionary authority and require a regional general permit or an individual permit application.

    (6) In instances where a state has disagreed with the Corps consistency determination for activities under a particular NWP, permittees must furnish the DE with an individual consistency concurrence or a copy of the consistency certification provided to the state for concurrence. If a state fails to act on a permittee's consistency certification within six months after receipt by the state, concurrence will be presumed. Upon receipt of an individual consistency concurrence or upon presumed consistency, the proposed work is authorized if it complies with all terms and conditions of the NWP. For NWPs requiring a 45-day pre-construction notification the DE will immediately begin, and may complete, his review prior to the state action on the individual consistency certification. If a state indicates that individual conditions are necessary for consistency with the state's Federally-approved coastal management program for that individual activity, the DE will include those conditions as activity-specific conditions of the NWP unless he determines that such conditions do not comply with the provisions of 33 CFR 325.4. In the latter case the DE will consider the conditioned concurrence as a non-concurrence unless the permittee chooses to comply voluntarily with all the conditions in the conditioned concurrence.

    (7) Where a state, after agreeing with the Corps consistency determination, subsequently attempts to reverse it's agreement for substantive reasons after the effective date of the NWP, the division engineer will review those reasons and consider whether there is substantial basis for suspension, modification, or revocation as outlined in 33 CFR 330.5. Otherwise, such attempted reversal is not effective and the Corps will consider the state CZMA consistency agreement to be valid for the NWP authorization until such time as the NWP is modified or reissued.

    (8) Federal activities must be consistent with a state's Federally-approved coastal management program to the maximum extent practicable. Federal agencies should follow their own procedures and the Department of Commerce regulations appearing at 15 CFR part 930 to meet the requirements of the CZMA. Therefore, the provisions of 33 CFR 330.4(d)(1)-(7) do not apply to Federal activities. Indian tribes doing work on Indian Reservation lands shall be treated in the same manner as Federal applicants.

    (e)  The Corps reserves the right (, discretion) to modify, suspend, or revoke NWP authorizations. Modification means the imposition of additional or revised terms or conditions on the authorization. Suspension means the temporary cancellation of the authorization while a decision is made to either modify, revoke, or reinstate the authorization. Revocation means the cancellation of the authorization. The procedures for modifying, suspending, or revoking NWP authorizations are detailed in § 330.5.

    (1) A division engineer may assert discretionary authority by modifying, suspending, or revoking NWP authorizations for a specific geographic area, class of activity, or class of waters within his division, including on a statewide basis, whenever he determines sufficient concerns for the environment under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines or any other factor of the public interest so requires, or if he otherwise determines that the NWP would result in more than minimal adverse environmental effects either individually or cumulatively.

    (2) A DE may assert discretionary authority by modifying, suspending, or revoking NWP authorization for a specific activity whenever he determines sufficient concerns for the environment or any other factor of the public interest so requires. Whenever the DE determines that a proposed specific activity covered by an NWP would have more than minimal individual or cumulative adverse effects on the environment or otherwise may be contrary to the public interest, he must either modify the NWP authorization to reduce or eliminate the adverse impacts, or notify the prospective permittee that the proposed activity is not authorized by NWP and provide instructions on how to seek authorization under a regional general or individual permit.

    (3) The division or district engineer will restore authorization under the NWPs at any time he determines that his reason for asserting discretionary authority has been satisfied by a condition, project modification, or new information.

    (4) When the Chief of Engineers modifies or reissues an NWP, division engineers must use the procedures of § 330.5 to reassert discretionary authority to reinstate regional conditions or revocation of NWP authorizations for specific geographic areas, class of activities, or class of waters. Division engineers will update existing documentation for each NWP. Upon modification or reissuance of NWPs, previous activity-specific conditions or revocations of NWP authorization will remain in effect unless the DE specifically removes the activity-specific conditions or revocations.

    (f)  No activity is authorized by any NWP if that activity is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species as listed or proposed for listing under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), or to destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of such species.

    (1) Federal agencies should follow their own procedures for complying with the requirements of the ESA.

    (2) Non-federal permittees shall notify the DE if any Federally listed (or proposed for listing) endangered or threatened species or critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project. In such cases, the prospective permittee will not begin work under authority of the NWP until notified by the district engineer that the requirements of the Endangered Species Act have been satisfied and that the activity is authorized. If the DE determines that the activity may affect any Federally listed species or critical habitat, the DE must initiate section 7 consultation in accordance with the ESA. In such cases, the DE may:

    (i) Initiate section 7 consultation and then, upon completion, authorize the activity under the NWP by adding, if appropriate, activity-specific conditions; or

    (ii) Prior to or concurrent with section 7 consultation, assert discretionary authority (see 33 CFR 330.4(e)) and require an individual permit (see 33 CFR 330.5(d)).

    (3) Prospective permittees are encouraged to obtain information on the location of threatened or endangered species and their critical habitats from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Office, and the National Marine Fisheries Service.

    (g)  No activity which may affect properties listed or properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, is authorized until the DE has complied with the provisions of 33 CFR part 325, appendix C.

    (1) Federal permittees should follow their own procedures for compliance with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act and other Federal historic preservation laws.

    (2) Non-federal permittees will notify the DE if the activity may affect historic properties which the National Park Service has listed, determined eligible for listing, or which the prospective permittee has reason to believe may be eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic Places. In such cases, the prospective permittee will not begin the proposed activity until notified by the DE that the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act have been satisfied and that the activity is authorized. If a property in the permit area of the activity is determined to be an historic property in accordance with 33 CFR part 325, appendix C, the DE will take into account the effects on such properties in accordance with 33 CFR part 325, appendix C. In such cases, the district engineer may:

    (i) After complying with the requirements of 33 CFR part 325, appendix C, authorize the activity under the NWP by adding, if appropriate, activity-specific conditions; or

    (ii) Prior to or concurrent with complying with the requirements of 33 CFR part 325, appendix C, he may assert discretionary authority (see 33 CFR 330.4(e)) and instruct the prospective permittee of procedures to seek authorization under a regional general permit or an individual permit. (See 33 CFR 330.5(d).)

    (3) The permittee shall immediately notify the DE if, before or during prosecution of the work authorized, he encounters an historic property that has not been listed or determined eligible for listing on the National Register, but which the prospective permittee has reason to believe may be eligible for listing on the National Register.

    (4) Prospective permittees are encouraged to obtain information on the location of historic properties from the State Historic Preservation Officer and the National Register of Historic Places.

    § 330.5   Issuing, modifying, suspending, or revoking nationwide permits and authorizations.

#### § § 330.5

    (a)  This section sets forth the procedures for issuing and reissuing NWPs and for modifying, suspending, or revoking NWPs and authorizations under NWPs.

    (b)  (1) Anyone may, at any time, suggest to the Chief of Engineers, (ATTN: CECW-OR), any new NWPs or conditions for issuance, or changes to existing NWPs, which he believes to be appropriate for consideration. From time-to-time new NWPs and revocations of or modifications to existing NWPs will be evaluated by the Chief of Engineers following the procedures specified in this section. Within five years of issuance of the NWPs, the Chief of Engineers will review the NWPs and propose modification, revocation, or reissuance.

    (2)  (i) Upon proposed issuance of new NWPs or modification, suspension, revocation, or reissuance of existing NWPs, the Chief of Engineers will publish a document seeking public comments, including the opportunity to request a public hearing. This document will also state that the information supporting the Corps' provisional determination that proposed activities comply with the requirements for issuance under general permit authority is available at the Office of the Chief of Engineers and at all district offices. The Chief of Engineers will prepare this information which will be supplemented, if appropriate, by division engineers.

    (ii) Concurrent with the Chief of Engineers' notification of proposed, modified, reissued, or revoked NWPs, DEs will notify the known interested public by a notice issued at the district level. The notice will include proposed regional conditions or proposed revocations of NWP authorizations for specific geographic areas, classes of activities, or classes of waters, if any, developed by the division engineer.

    (3)  The Chief of Engineers will prepare appropriate NEPA documents and, if applicable, section 404(b)(1) Guidelines compliance analyses for proposed NWPs. Documentation for existing NWPs will be modified to reflect any changes in these permits and to reflect the Chief of Engineers' evaluation of the use of the permit since the last issuance. Copies of all comments received on the document will be included in the administrative record. The Chief of Engineers will consider these comments in making his decision on the NWPs, and will prepare a statement of findings outlining his views regarding each NWP and discussing how substantive comments were considered. The Chief of Engineers will also determine the need to hold a public hearing for the proposed NWPs.

    (4)  The Chief of Engineers will advise the public of the effective date of any issuance, modification, or revocation of an NWP.

    (c)  (1) A division engineer may use his discretionary authority to modify, suspend, or revoke NWP authorizations for any specific geographic area, class of activities, or class of waters within his division, including on a statewide basis, by issuing a public notice or notifying the individuals involved. The notice will state his concerns regarding the environment or the other relevant factors of the public interest. Before using his discretionary authority to modify or revoke such NWP authorizations, division engineers will:

    (i) Give an opportunity for interested parties to express their views on the proposed action (the DE will publish and circulate a notice to the known interested public to solicit comments and provide the opportunity to request a public hearing);

    (ii) Consider fully the views of affected parties;

    (iii) Prepare supplemental documentation for any modifications or revocations that may result through assertion of discretionary authority. Such documentation will include comments received on the district public notices and a statement of findings showing how substantive comments were considered;

    (iv) Provide, if appropriate, a grandfathering period as specified in § 330.6(b) for those who have commenced work or are under contract to commence in reliance on the NWP authorization; and

    (v) Notify affected parties of the modification, suspension, or revocation, including the effective date (the DE will publish and circulate a notice to the known interested public and to anyone who commented on the proposed action).

    (2) The modification, suspension, or revocation of authorizations under an NWP by the division engineer will become effective by issuance of public notice or a notification to the individuals involved.

    (3) A copy of all regional conditions imposed by division engineers on activities authorized by NWPs will be forwarded to the Office of the Chief of Engineers, ATTN: CECW-OR.

    (d)  (1) When deciding whether to exercise his discretionary authority to modify, suspend, or revoke a case specific activity's authorization under an NWP, the DE should consider to the extent relevant and appropriate: Changes in circumstances relating to the authorized activity since the NWP itself was issued or since the DE confirmed authorization under the NWP by written verification; the continuing need for, or adequacy of, the specific conditions of the authorization; any significant objections to the authorization not previously considered; progress inspections of individual activities occurring under an NWP; cumulative adverse environmental effects resulting from activities occurring under the NWP; the extent of the permittee's compliance with the terms and conditions of the NWPs; revisions to applicable statutory or regulatory authorities; and, the extent to which asserting discretionary authority would adversely affect plans, investments, and actions the permittee has made or taken in reliance on the permit; and, other concerns for the environment, including the aquatic environment under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, and other relevant factors of the public interest.

    (2)  (i) When considering whether to modify or revoke a specific authorization under an NWP, whenever practicable, the DE will initially hold informal consultations with the permittee to determine whether special conditions to modify the authorization would be mutually agreeable or to allow the permittee to furnish information which satisfies the DE's concerns. If a mutual agreement is reached, the DE will give the permittee written verification of the authorization, including the special conditions. If the permittee furnishes information which satisfies the DE's concerns, the permittee may proceed. If appropriate, the DE may suspend the NWP authorization while holding informal consultations with the permittee.

    (ii) If the DE's concerns remain after the informal consultation, the DE may suspend a specific authorization under an NWP by notifying the permittee in writing by the most expeditious means available that the authorization has been suspended, stating the reasons for the suspension, and ordering the permittee to stop any activities being done in reliance upon the authorization under the NWP. The permittee will be advised that a decision will be made either to reinstate or revoke the authorization under the NWP; or, if appropriate, that the authorization under the NWP may be modified by mutual agreement. The permittee will also be advised that within 10 days of receipt of the notice of suspension, he may request a meeting with the DE, or his designated representative, to present information in this matter. After completion of the meeting (or within a reasonable period of time after suspending the authorization if no meeting is requested), the DE will take action to reinstate, modify, or revoke the authorization.

    (iii) Following completion of the suspension procedures, if the DE determines that sufficient concerns for the environment, including the aquatic environment under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, or other relevant factors of the public interest so require, he will revoke authorization under the NWP. The DE will provide the permittee a written final decision and instruct him on the procedures to seek authorization under a regional general permit or an individual permit.

    (3) The DE need not issue a public notice when asserting discretionary authority over a specific activity. The modification, suspension, or revocation will become effective by notification to the prospective permittee.

    § 330.6   Authorization by nationwide permit.

#### § § 330.6

    (a)  (1) Nationwide permittees may, and in some cases must, request from a DE confirmation that an activity complies with the terms and conditions of an NWP. DEs should respond as promptly as practicable to such requests.

    (2) If the DE decides that an activity does not comply with the terms or conditions of an NWP, he will notify the person desiring to do the work and instruct him on the procedures to seek authorization under a regional general permit or individual permit.

    (3) If the DE decides that an activity does comply with the terms and conditions of an NWP, he will notify the nationwide permittee.

    (i) The DE may add conditions on a case-by-case basis to clarify compliance with the terms and conditions of an NWP or to ensure that the activity will have only minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects on the environment, and will not be contrary to the public interest.

    (ii) The DE's response will state that the verification is valid for a specific period of time (generally until the expiration date of the NWP) unless the NWP authorization is modified, suspended, or revoked. The response should also include a statement that the verification will remain valid for the specified period of time, if during that time period, the NWP authorization is reissued without modification or the activity complies with any subsequent modification of the NWP authorization. Furthermore, the response should include a statement that the provisions of § 330.6(b) will apply, if during that period of time, the NWP authorization expires, or is suspended or revoked, or is modified, such that the activity would no longer comply with the terms and conditions of an NWP. Finally, the response should include any known expiration date that would occur during the specified period of time. A period of time less than the amount of time remaining until the expiration date of the NWP may be used if deemed appropriate.

    (iii) For activities where a state has denied 401 water quality certification and/or did not agree with the Corps consistency determination for an NWP the DE's response will state that the proposed activity meets the terms and conditions for authorization under the NWP with the exception of a state 401 water quality certification and/or CZM consistency concurrence. The response will also indicate the activity is denied without prejudice and cannot be authorized until the requirements of §§ 330.4(c)(3), 330.4(c)(6), 330.4(d)(3), and 330.4(d)(6) are satisfied. The response will also indicate that work may only proceed subject to the terms and conditions of the state 401 water quality certification and/or CZM concurrence.

    (iv) Once the DE has provided such verification, he must use the procedures of 33 CFR 330.5 in order to modify, suspend, or revoke the authorization.

    (b)  The Chief of Engineers will periodically review NWPs and their conditions and will decide to either modify, reissue, or revoke the permits. If an NWP is not modified or reissued within five years of its effective date, it automatically expires and becomes null and void. Activities which have commenced (i.e, are under construction) or are under contract to commence in reliance upon an NWP will remain authorized provided the activity is completed within twelve months of the date of an NWP's expiration, modification, or revocation, unless discretionary authority has been exercised on a case-by-case basis to modify, suspend, or revoke the authorization in accordance with 33 CFR 330.4(e) and 33 CFR 330.5 (c) or (d). Activities completed under the authorization of an NWP which was in effect at the time the activity was completed continue to be authorized by that NWP.

    (c)  Two or more different NWPs can be combined to authorize a “single and complete project” as defined at 33 CFR 330.2(i). However, the same NWP cannot be used more than once for a single and complete project.

    (d)  Subject to the following qualifications, portions of a larger project may proceed under the authority of the NWPs while the DE evaluates an individual permit application for other portions of the same project, but only if the portions of the project qualifying for NWP authorization would have independent utility and are able to function or meet their purpose independent of the total project. When the functioning or usefulness of a portion of the total project qualifying for an NWP is dependent on the remainder of the project, such that its construction and use would not be fully justified even if the Corps were to deny the individual permit, the NWP does not apply and all portions of the project must be evaluated as part of the individual permit process.

    (1) When a portion of a larger project is authorized to proceed under an NWP, it is with the understanding that its construction will in no way prejudice the decision on the individual permit for the rest of the project. Furthermore, the individual permit documentation must include an analysis of the impacts of the entire project, including related activities authorized by NWP.

    (2) NWPs do not apply, even if a portion of the project is not dependent on the rest of the project, when any portion of the project is subject to an enforcement action by the Corps or EPA.

    (e)  These authorizations often play an important part in the resolution of violations. In appropriate cases where the activity complies with the terms and conditions of an NWP, the DE can elect to use the NWP for resolution of an after-the-fact permit situation following a consideration of whether the violation being resolved was knowing or intentional and other indications of the need for a penalty. For example, where an unauthorized fill meets the terms and conditions of NWP 13, the DE can consider the appropriateness of allowing the residual fill to remain, in situations where said fill would normally have been permitted under NWP 13. A knowing, intentional, willful violation should be the subject of an enforcement action leading to a penalty, rather than an after-the-fact authorization. Use of after-the-fact NWP authorization must be consistent with the terms of the Army/EPA Memorandum of Agreement on Enforcement. Copies are available from each district engineer.

  PART 331—ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL PROCESS

### Part 331

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401  1344, 1413.

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 16493, Mar. 28, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

    § 331.1   Purpose and policy.

#### § § 331.1

    (a)  The purpose of this part is to establish policies and procedures to be used for the administrative appeal of approved jurisdictional determinations (JDs), permit applications denied with prejudice, and declined permits. The appeal process will allow the affected party to pursue an administrative appeal of certain Corps of Engineers decisions with which they disagree. The basis for an appeal and the specific policies and procedures of the appeal process are described in the following sections. It shall be the policy of the Corps of Engineers to promote and maintain an administrative appeal process that is independent, objective, fair, prompt, and efficient.

    (b)  Appealable actions decided by a division engineer or higher authority may be appealed to an Army official at least one level higher than the decision maker. This higher Army official shall make the decision on the merits of the appeal, and may appoint a qualified individual to act as a review officer (as defined in § 331.2). References to the division engineer in this part shall be understood as also referring to a higher level Army official when such official is conducting an administrative appeal.

    § 331.2   Definitions.

#### § § 331.2

    The terms and definitions contained in 33 CFR Parts 320 through 330 are applicable to this part. In addition, the following terms are defined for the purposes of this part:

    means a permit applicant, landowner, a lease, easement or option holder ( an individual who has an identifiable and substantial legal interest in the property) who has received an approved JD, permit denial, or has declined a proffered individual permit.

    means the affected party's business partner, attorney, consultant, engineer, planner, or any individual with legal authority to represent the appellant's interests.

    means an approved JD, a permit denial, or a declined permit, as these terms are defined in this section.

    means an affected party who has filed an appeal of an approved JD, a permit denial or declined permit under the criteria and procedures of this part.

    means a Corps document stating the presence or absence of waters of the United States on a parcel or a written statement and map identifying the limits of waters of the United States on a parcel. Approved JDs are clearly designated appealable actions and will include a basis of JD with the document.

    is a summary of the indicators that support the Corps approved JD. Indicators supporting the Corps approved JD can include, but are not limited to: indicators of wetland hydrology, hydric soils, and hydrophytic plant communities; indicators of ordinary high water marks, high tide lines, or mean high water marks; indicators of adjacency to navigable or interstate waters; indicators that the wetland or waterbody is of part of a tributary system; or indicators of linkages between isolated water bodies and interstate or foreign commerce.

    means a proffered individual permit, including a letter of permission, that an applicant has refused to accept, because he has objections to the terms and special conditions therein. A declined permit can also be an individual permit that the applicant originally accepted, but where such permit was subsequently modified by the district engineer, pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7, in such a manner that the resulting permit contains terms and special conditions that lead the applicant to decline the modified permit, provided that the applicant has not started work in waters of the United States authorized by such permit. Where an applicant declines a permit (either initial or modified), the applicant does not have a valid permit to conduct regulated activities in waters of the United States, and must not begin construction of the work requiring a Corps permit unless and until the applicant receives and accepts a valid Corps permit.

    means a letter from the district engineer detailing the reasons a permit was denied with prejudice. The decision document for the project will be attached to the denial determination in all cases.

    means a written Corps determination that a wetland and/or waterbody is subject to regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) or a written determination that a waterbody is subject to regulatory jurisdiction under Section 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 ). Additionally, the term includes a written reverification of expired JDs and a written reverification of JDs where new information has become available that may affect the previously written determination. For example, such geographic JDs may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following determinations: the presence or absence of wetlands; the location(s) of the wetland boundary, ordinary high water mark, mean high water mark, and/or high tide line; interstate commerce nexus for isolated waters; and adjacency of wetlands to other waters of the United States. All JDs will be in writing and will be identified as either preliminary or approved. JDs do not include determinations that a particular activity requires a DA permit.

    means a fact sheet that explains the criteria and procedures of the administrative appeal process. Every approved JD, permit denial, and every proffered individual permit returned for reconsideration after review by the district engineer in accordance with § 331.6(b) will have an NAP form attached.

    means a fact sheet explaining an applicant's options with a proffered individual permit under the administrative appeal process.

    means a written denial with prejudice (see 33 CFR 320.4(j)) of an individual permit application as defined in 33 CFR 325.5(b).

    are written indications that there may be waters of the United States on a parcel or indications of the approximate location(s) of waters of the United States on a parcel. _Preliminary JDs_ are advisory in nature and may not be appealed. Preliminary JDs include compliance orders that have an implicit JD, but no approved JD.

    means a permit that is sent to an applicant that is in the proper format for the applicant to sign (for a standard permit) or accept (for a letter of permission). The term “initial proffered permit” as used in this part refers to the first time a permit is sent to the applicant. The initial proffered permit is not an appealable action. However, the applicant may object to the terms or conditions of the initial proffered permit and, if so, a second reconsidered permit will be sent to the applicant. The term “proffered permit” as used in this part refers to the second permit that is sent to the applicant. Such proffered permit is an appealable action.

    means the affected party's official request to initiate the appeal process. The RFA must include the name of the affected party, the Corps file number of the approved JD, denied permit, or declined permit, the reason(s) for the appeal, and any supporting data and information. No new information may be submitted. A grant of right of entry for the Corps to the project site is a condition of the RFA to allow the RO to clarify elements of the record or to conduct field tests or sampling for purposes directly related to the appeal. A standard RFA form will be provided to the affected party with the NAP form. For appeals of decisions related to unauthorized activities a signed tolling agreement, as required by 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(v), must be included with the RFA, unless a signed tolling agreement has previously been furnished to the Corps district office. The affected party initiates the administrative appeal process by providing an acceptable RFA to the appropriate Corps of Engineers division office. An acceptable RFA contains all the required information and provides reasons for appeal that meets the criteria identified in § 331.5.

    means the Corps official responsible for assisting the division engineer or higher authority responsible for rendering the final decision on the merits of an appeal.

    refers to a document signed by any person who appeals an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or applies for an after-the-fact (ATF) permit, where the application is accepted and evaluated by the Corps. The agreement states that the affected party agrees to have the statute of limitations regarding any violation associated with that approved JD or application “tolled” or temporarily set aside until one year after the final Corps decision, as defined at § 331.10. No ATF permit application or administrative appeal associated with an unauthorized activity will be accepted until a tolling agreement is furnished to the district engineer.

    § 331.3   Review officer.

#### § § 331.3

    (a)  (1) The division engineer has the authority and responsibility for administering a fair, reasonable, prompt, and effective administrative appeal process. The division engineer may act as the review officer (RO), or may delegate, either generically or on a case-by-case basis, any authority or responsibility described in this part as that of the RO. With the exception of JDs, as described in this paragraph (a)(1), the division engineer may not delegate any authority or responsibility described in this part as that of the division engineer. For approved JDs only, the division engineer may delegate any authority or responsibility described in this part as that of the division engineer, including the final appeal decision. In such cases, any delegated authority must be granted to an official that is at the same or higher grade level than the grade level of the official that signed the approved JD. Regardless of any delegation of authority or responsibility for ROs or for final appeal decisions for approved JDs, the division engineer retains overall responsibility for the administrative appeal process.

    (2) The RO will assist the division engineer in reaching and documenting the division engineer's decision on the merits of an appeal, if the division engineer has delegated this responsibility as explained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The division engineer has the authority to make the final decision on the merits of the appeal. Neither the RO nor the division engineer has the authority to make a final decision to issue or deny any particular permit nor to make an approved JD, pursuant to the administrative appeal process established by this part. The authority to issue or deny permits remains with the district engineer. However, the division engineer may exercise the authority at 33 CFR 325.8(c) to elevate any permit application, and subsequently make the final permit decision. In such a case, any appeal process of the district engineer's initial decision is terminated. If a particular permit application is elevated to the division engineer pursuant to 33 CFR 325.8(c), and the division engineer's decision on the permit application is a permit denial or results in a declined permit, that permit denial or declined permit would be subject to an administrative appeal to the Chief of Engineers.

    (3)  The RO will be a Corps employee with extensive knowledge of the Corps regulatory program. Where the permit decision being appealed was made by the division engineer or higher authority, a Corps official at least one level higher than the decision maker shall make the decision on the merits of the RFA, and this Corps official shall appoint a qualified individual as the RO to conduct the appeal process.

    (b) —(1)  The RO will not perform, or have been involved with, the preparation, review, or decision making of the action being appealed. The RO will be independent and impartial in reviewing any appeal, and when assisting the division engineer to make a decision on the merits of the appeal.

    (2)  The RO will conduct an independent review of the administrative record to address the reasons for the appeal cited by the applicant in the RFA. In addition, to the extent that it is practicable and feasible, the RO will also conduct an independent review of the administrative record to verify that the record provides an adequate and reasonable basis supporting the district engineer's decision, that facts or analysis essential to the district engineer's decision have not been omitted from the administrative record, and that all relevant requirements of law, regulations, and officially promulgated Corps policy guidance have been satisfied. Should the RO require expert advice regarding any subject, he may seek such advice from any employee of the Corps or of another Federal or state agency, or from any recognized expert, so long as that person had not been previously involved in the action under review.

    § 331.4   Notification of appealable actions.

#### § § 331.4

    Affected parties will be notified in writing of a Corps decision on those activities that are eligible for an appeal. For approved JDs, the notification must include an NAP fact sheet, an RFA form, and a basis of JD. For permit denials, the notification must include a copy of the decision document for the permit application, an NAP fact sheet and an RFA form. For proffered individual permits, when the initial proffered permit is sent to the applicant, the notification must include an NAO fact sheet. For declined permits (, proffered individual permits that the applicant refuses to accept and sends back to the Corps), the notification must include an NAP fact sheet and an RFA form. Additionally, an affected party has the right to obtain a copy of the administrative record.

    § 331.5   Criteria.

#### § § 331.5

    (a) —(1)  The appellant must submit a completed RFA (as defined at § 331.2) to the appropriate division office in order to appeal an approved JD, a permit denial, or a declined permit. An individual permit that has been signed by the applicant, and subsequently unilaterally modified by the district engineer pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7, may be appealed under this process, provided that the applicant has not started work in waters of the United States authorized by the permit. The RFA must be received by the division engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP.

    (2)  The reason(s) for requesting an appeal of an approved JD, a permit denial, or a declined permit must be specifically stated in the RFA and must be more than a simple request for appeal because the affected party did not like the approved JD, permit decision, or the permit conditions. Examples of reasons for appeals include, but are not limited to, the following: A procedural error; an incorrect application of law, regulation or officially promulgated policy; omission of material fact; incorrect application of the current regulatory criteria and associated guidance for identifying and delineating wetlands; incorrect application of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (see 40 CFR part 230); or use of incorrect data. The reasons for appealing a permit denial or a declined permit may include jurisdiction issues, whether or not a previous approved JD was appealed.

    (b)  An action or decision is not subject to an administrative appeal under this part if it falls into one or more of the following categories:

    (1) An individual permit decision (including a letter of permission or a standard permit with special conditions), where the permit has been accepted and signed by the permittee. By signing the permit, the applicant waives all rights to appeal the terms and conditions of the permit, unless the authorized work has not started in waters of the United States and that issued permit is subsequently modified by the district engineer pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7;

    (2) Any site-specific matter that has been the subject of a final decision of the Federal courts;

    (3) A final Corps decision that has resulted from additional analysis and evaluation, as directed by a final appeal decision;

    (4) A permit denial without prejudice or a declined permit, where the controlling factor cannot be changed by the Corps decision maker (e.g., the requirements of a binding statute, regulation, state Section 401 water quality certification, state coastal zone management disapproval, etc. (See 33 CFR 320.4(j));

    (5) A permit denial case where the applicant has subsequently modified the proposed project, because this would constitute an amended application that would require a new public interest review, rather than an appeal of the existing record and decision;

    (6) Any request for the appeal of an approved JD, a denied permit, or a declined permit where the RFA has not been received by the division engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP;

    (7) A previously approved JD that has been superseded by another approved JD based on new information or data submitted by the applicant. The new approved JD is an appealable action;

    (8) An approved JD associated with an individual permit where the permit has been accepted and signed by the permittee;

    (9) A preliminary JD; or

    (10) A JD associated with unauthorized activities except as provided in § 331.11.

    § 331.6   Filing an appeal.

#### § § 331.6

    (a) An affected party appealing an approved JD, permit denial or declined permit must submit an RFA that is received by the division engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP. Flow charts illustrating the appeal process are in the Appendices of this part.

    (b) In the case where an applicant objects to an initial proffered individual permit, the appeal process proceeds as follows. To initiate the appeal process regarding the terms and special conditions of the permit, the applicant must write a letter to the district engineer explaining his objections to the permit. The district engineer, upon evaluation of the applicant's objections, may: Modify the permit to address all of the applicant's objections or modify the permit to address some, but not all, of the applicant's objections, or not modify the permit, having determined that the permit should be issued as previously written. In the event that the district engineer agrees to modify the initial proffered individual permit to address all of the applicant's objections, the district engineer will proffer such modified permit to the applicant, enclosing an NAP fact sheet and an RFA form as well. Should the district engineer modify the initial proffered individual permit to address some, but not all, of the applicant's objections, the district engineer will proffer such modified permit to the applicant, enclosing an NAP fact sheet, RFA form, and a copy of the decision document for the project. If the district engineer does not modify the initial proffered individual permit, the district engineer will proffer the unmodified permit to the applicant a second time, enclosing an NAP fact sheet, an RFA form, and a copy of the decision document. If the applicant still has objections, after receiving the second proffered permit (modified or unmodified), the applicant may decline such proffered permit; this declined permit may be appealed to the division engineer upon submittal of a complete RFA form. The completed RFA must be received by the division engineer within 60 days of the NAP. A flow chart of an applicant's options for an initial proffered individual permit is shown in appendix B of this part. A flow chart of the appeal process for a permit denial or a declined permit ( a proffered permit declined after the Corps decision on the applicant's objections to the initial proffered permit) is shown in appendix A of this part. A flow chart of the appeal process for an approved jurisdictional determination is shown in appendix C of this part. A flow chart of the process for when an unacceptable request for appeal is returned to an applicant is shown in appendix D of this part.

    (c) An approved JD will be reconsidered by the district engineer if the affected party submits new information or data to the district engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP. (An RFA that contains new information will either be returned to the district engineer for reconsideration or the appeal will be processed if the applicant withdraws the new information.) The district engineer has 60 days from the receipt of such new information or data to review the new information or data, consider whether or not that information changes the previously approved JD, and, reissue the approved JD or issue a new approved JD. The reconsideration of an approved JD by the district engineer does not commence the administrative appeal process. The affected party may appeal the district engineer's reissued or new approved JD.

    (d) The district engineer may not delegate his signature authority to deny the permit with prejudice or to return an individual permit to the applicant with unresolved objections. The district engineer may delegate signature authority for JDs, including approved JDs.

    (e) Affected parties may appeal approved JDs where the determination was dated after March 28, 2000, but may not appeal approved JDs dated on or before March 28, 2000. The Corps will begin processing JD appeals no later than May 30, 2000. All appeals must meet the criteria set forth in § 331.5. If work is authorized by either general or individual permit, and the affected party wishes to request an appeal of the JD associated with the general permit authorization or individual permit or the special conditions of the proffered individual permit, the appeal must be received by the Corps and the appeal process concluded prior to the commencement of any work in waters of the United States and prior to any work that could alter the hydrology of waters of the United States.

    § 331.7   Review procedures.

#### § § 331.7

    (a)  The administrative appeal process for approved JDs, permit denials, and declined permits is a one level appeal, normally to the division engineer. The appeal process will normally be conducted by the RO. The RO will document the appeal process, and assist the division engineer in making a decision on the merits of the appeal. The division engineer may participate in the appeal process as the division engineer deems appropriate. The division engineer will make the decision on the merits of the appeal, and provide any instructions, as appropriate, to the district engineer.

    (b)  Upon receipt of an RFA, the RO shall review the RFA to determine whether the RFA is acceptable ( complete and meets the criteria for appeal). If the RFA is acceptable, the RO will so notify the appellant in writing within 30 days of the receipt of the acceptable RFA. If the RO determines that the RFA is not complete the RO will so notify the appellant in writing within 30 days of the receipt of the RFA detailing the reason(s) why the RFA is not complete. If the RO believes that the RFA does not meet the criteria for appeal (see § 331.5), the RO will make a recommendation on the RFA to the division engineer. If the division engineer determines that the RFA is not acceptable, the division engineer will notify the appellant of this determination by a certified letter detailing the reason(s) why the appeal failed to meet the criteria for appeal. No further administrative appeal is available, unless the appellant revises the RFA to correct the deficiencies noted in the division engineer's letter or the RO's letter. The revised RFA must be received by the division engineer within 30 days of the date of the Corps letter indicating that the initial RFA is not acceptable. If the RO determines that the revised RFA is still not complete, the RO will again so notify the appellant in writing within 30 days of the receipt of the RFA detailing the reason(s) why the RFA is not complete. If the division engineer determines that the revised RFA is still not acceptable, the division engineer will notify the appellant of this determination by a certified letter within 30 days of the date of the receipt of the revised RFA, and will advise the appellant that the matter is not eligible for appeal. No further RFAs will be accepted after this point.

    (c)  Within 30 days of receipt of an acceptable RFA, the RO should determine if a site investigation is needed to clarify the administrative record. The RO should normally conduct any such site investigation within 60 days of receipt of an acceptable RFA. The RO may also conduct a site investigation at the request of the appellant, provided the RO has determined that such an investigation would be of benefit in interpreting the administrative record. The appellant and the appellant's authorized agent(s) must be provided an opportunity to participate in any site investigation, and will be given 15 days notice of any site investigation. The RO will attempt to schedule any site investigation at the earliest practicable time acceptable to both the RO and the appellant. The RO, the appellant, the appellant's agent(s) and the Corps district staff are authorized participants at any site investigation. The RO may also invite any other party the RO has determined to be appropriate, such as any technical experts consulted by the Corps. For permit denials and declined permit appeals, any site investigation should be scheduled in conjunction with the appeal review conference, where practicable. If extenuating circumstances occur at the site that preclude the appellant and/or the RO from conducting any required site visit within 60 days, the RO may extend the time period for review. Examples of extenuating circumstances may include seasonal hydrologic conditions, winter weather, or disturbed site conditions. The site visit must be conducted as soon as practicable as allowed by the extenuating circumstances, however, in no case shall any site visit extend the total appeals process beyond twelve months from the date of receipt of the RFA. If any site visit delay is necessary, the RO will notify the appellant in writing.

    (d)  The RO may schedule an informal meeting moderated by the RO or conference call with the appellant, his authorized agent, or both, and appropriate Corps regulatory personnel to review and discuss issues directly related to the appeal for the purpose of clarifying the administrative record. If a meeting is held, the appellant will bear his own costs associated with necessary arrangements, exhibits, travel, and representatives. The approved JD appeal meeting should be held at a location of reasonable convenience to the appellant and near the site where the approved JD was conducted.

    (e)  Conferences held in accordance with this part will be informal, and will be chaired by the RO. The purpose of the appeal conference is to provide a forum that allows the participants to discuss freely all relevant issues and material facts associated with the appeal. An appeal conference will be held for every appeal of a permit denial or a declined permit, unless the RO and the appellant mutually agree to forego a conference. The conference will take place within 60 days of receipt of an acceptable RFA, unless the RO determines that unforeseen or unusual circumstances require scheduling the conference for a later date. The purpose of the conference will be to allow the appellant and the Corps district representatives to discuss supporting data and information on issues previously identified in the administrative record, and to allow the RO the opportunity to clarify elements of the administrative record. Presentations by the appellant and the Corps district representatives may include interpretation, clarification, or explanation of the legal, policy, and factual bases for their positions. The conference will be governed by the following guidelines:

    (1)  The RO will set a date, time, and location for the conference. The RO will notify the appellant and the Corps district office in writing within 30 days of receipt of the RFA, and not less than 15 days before the date of the conference.

    (2)  The conference will be held at a location that has suitable facilities and that is reasonably convenient to the appellant, preferably in the proximity of the project site. Public facilities available at no expense are preferred. If a free facility is not available, the Corps will pay the cost for the facility.

    (3)  The RO, the appellant, the appellant's agent(s) and the Corps district staff are authorized participants in the conference. The RO may also invite any other party the RO has determined to be appropriate, such as any technical experts consulted by the Corps, adjacent property owners or Federal or state agency personnel to clarify elements of the administrative record. The division engineer and/or the district engineer may attend the conference at their discretion. If the appellant or his authorized agent(s) fail to attend the appeal conference, the appeal process is terminated, unless the RO excuses the appellant for a justifiable reason. Furthermore, should the process be terminated in such a manner, the district engineer's original decision on the appealed action will be sustained.

    (4)  The RO shall be in charge of conducting the conference. The RO shall open the conference with a summary of the policies and procedures for conducting the conference. The RO will conduct a fair and impartial conference, hear and fully consider all relevant issues and facts, and seek clarification of any issues of the administrative record, as needed, to allow the division engineer to make a final determination on the merits of the appeal. The RO will also be responsible for documenting the appeal conference.

    (5)  The appellant, and/or the appellant's authorized agent(s), will be given a reasonable opportunity to present the appellant's views regarding the subject permit denial or declined permit.

    (6)  The purpose of the appeal conference will be to discuss the reasons for appeal contained in the RFA. Any material in the administrative record may be discussed during the conference, but the discussion should be focused on relevant issues needed to address the reasons for appeal contained in the RFA. The RO may question the appellant or the Corps representatives with respect to interpretation of particular issues in the record, or otherwise to clarify elements of the administrative record. Issues not identified in the administrative record by the date of the NAP for the application may not be raised or discussed, because substantive new information or project modifications would be treated as a new permit application (see § 331.5(b)(5)).

    (7)  The appeal conference is an informal proceeding, intended to provide clarifications and explanations of the administrative record for the RO and the division engineer; it is not intended to supplement the administrative record. Consequently, the proceedings of the conference will not be recorded verbatim by the Corps or any other party attending the conference, and no verbatim transcripts of the conference will be made. However, after the conference, the RO will write a memorandum for the record (MFR) summarizing the presentations made at the conference, and will provide a copy of that MFR to the division engineer, the appellant, and the district engineer.

    (8)  The appellant will be responsible for his own expenses for attending the appeal conference.

    (f)  The appeal of an approved JD, a permit denial, or a declined permit is limited to the information contained in the administrative record by the date of the NAP for the application or approved JD, the proceedings of the appeal conference, and any relevant information gathered by the RO as described in § 331.5. Neither the appellant nor the Corps may present new information not already contained in the administrative record, but both parties may interpret, clarify or explain issues and information contained in the record.

    (g)  Because a decision to determine geographic jurisdiction, deny a permit, or condition a permit depends on the facts, circumstances, and physical conditions particular to the specific project and/or site being evaluated, appeal decisions would be of little or no precedential utility. Therefore, an appeal decision of the division engineer is applicable only to the instant appeal, and has no other precedential effect. Such a decision may not be cited in any other administrative appeal, and may not be used as precedent for the evaluation of any other jurisdictional determination or permit application. While administrative appeal decisions lack precedential value and may not be cited by an appellant or a district engineer in any other appeal proceeding, the Corps goal is to have the Corps regulatory program operate as consistently as possible, particularly with respect to interpretations of law, regulation, an Executive Order, and officially-promulgated policy. Therefore, a copy of each appeal decision will be forwarded to Corps Headquarters; those decisions will be periodically reviewed at the headquarters level for consistency with law, Executive Orders, and policy. Additional official guidance will be issued as necessary to maintain or improve the consistency of the Corps' appellate and permit decisions.

    § 331.8   Timeframes for final appeal decisions.

#### § § 331.8

    The Division Engineer will make a final decision on the merits of the appeal at the earliest practicable time, in accordance with the following time limits. The administrative appeal process is initiated by the receipt of an RFA by the division engineer. The Corps will review the RFA to determine whether the RFA is acceptable. The Corps will notify the appellant accordingly within 30 days of the receipt of the RFA in accordance with § 331.7(b). If the Corps determines that the RFA is acceptable, the RO will immediately request the administrative record from the district engineer. The division engineer will normally make a final decision on the merits of the appeal within 90 days of the receipt of an acceptable RFA unless any site visit is delayed pursuant to § 331.7(c). In such case, the RO will complete the appeal review and the division engineer will make a final appeal decision within 30 days of the site visit. In no case will a site visit delay extend the total appeal process beyond twelve months from the date of receipt of an acceptable RFA.

    § 331.9   Final appeal decision.

#### § § 331.9

    (a) In accordance with the authorities contained in § 331.3(a), the division engineer will make a decision on the merits of the appeal. While reviewing an appeal and reaching a decision on the merits of an appeal, the division engineer can consult with or seek information from any person, including the district engineer.

    (b) The division engineer will disapprove the entirety of or any part of the district engineer's decision only if he determines that the decision on some relevant matter was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, or plainly contrary to a requirement of law, regulation, an Executive Order, or officially promulgated Corps policy guidance. The division engineer will not attempt to substitute his judgment for that of the district engineer regarding a matter of fact, so long as the district engineer's determination was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, or regarding any other matter if the district engineer's determination was reasonable and within the zone of discretion delegated to the district engineer by Corps regulations. The division engineer may instruct the district engineer on how to correct any procedural error that was prejudicial to the appellant (, that was not a “harmless” procedural error), or to reconsider the decision where any essential part of the district engineer's decision was not supported by accurate or sufficient information, or analysis, in the administrative record. The division engineer will document his decision on the merits of the appeal in writing, and provide a copy of this decision to the applicant (using certified mail) and the district engineer.

    (c) The final decision of the division engineer on the merits of the appeal will conclude the administrative appeal process, and this decision will be filed in the administrative record for the project.

    § 331.10   Final Corps decision.

#### § § 331.10

    The final Corps decision on a permit application is the initial decision to issue or deny a permit, unless the applicant submits an RFA, and the division engineer accepts the RFA, pursuant to this Part. The final Corps decision on an appealed action is as follows:

    (a) If the division engineer determines that the appeal is without merit, the final Corps decision is the district engineer's letter advising the applicant that the division engineer has decided that the appeal is without merit, confirming the district engineer's initial decision, and sending the permit denial or the proffered permit for signature to the appellant; or

    (b) If the division engineer determines that the appeal has merit, the final Corps decision is the district engineer's decision made pursuant to the division engineer's remand of the appealed action. The division engineer will remand the decision to the district engineer with specific instructions to review the administrative record, and to further analyze or evaluate specific issues. If the district engineer determines that the effects of the district engineer's reconsideration of the administrative record would be narrow in scope and impact, the district engineer must provide notification only to those parties who commented or participated in the original review, and would allow 15 days for the submission of supplemental comments. For permit decisions, where the district engineer determines that the effect of the district engineer's reconsideration of the administrative record would be substantial in scope and impact, the district engineer's review process will include issuance of a new public notice, and/or preparation of a supplemental environmental analysis and decision document (see 33 CFR 325.7). Subsequently, the district engineer's decision made pursuant to the division engineer's remand of the appealed action becomes the final Corps permit decision. Nothing in this part precludes the agencies' authorities pursuant to Section 404(q) of the Clean Water Act.

    § 331.11   Unauthorized activities.

#### § § 331.11

    Approved JDs, permit denials, and declined permits associated with after-the-fact permit applications are appealable actions for the purposes of this part. If the Corps accepts an after-the-fact permit application, an administrative appeal of an approved JD, permit denial, or declined permit may be filed and processed in accordance with these regulations subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. An appeal of an approved JD associated with unauthorized activities will normally not be accepted unless the Corps accepts an after-the-fact permit application. However, in rare cases, the district engineer may accept an appeal of such an approved JD, if the district engineer determines that the interests of justice, fairness, and administrative efficiency would be served thereby. Furthermore, no such appeal will be accepted if the unauthorized activity is the subject of a referral to the Department of Justice or the EPA, or for which the EPA has the lead enforcement authority or has requested lead enforcement authority.

    (a)  If the district engineer determines that initial corrective measures are necessary pursuant to 33 CFR 326.3(d), an RFA for an appealable action will not be accepted by the Corps, until the initial corrective measures have been completed to the satisfaction of the district engineer.

    (b)  If an affected party requests, under this Section, an administrative appeal of an appealable action prior to the resolution of the unauthorized activity, and the division engineer determines that the appeal has no merit, the responsible party remains subject to any civil, criminal, and administrative penalties as provided by law.

    (c)  Any person who appeals an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or applies for an after-the-fact permit, where the application is accepted and processed by the Corps, thereby agrees that the statute of limitations regarding any violation associated with that approved JD or application is tolled until one year after the final Corps decision, as defined at § 331.10. Moreover, the recipient of an approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or applicant for an after-the-fact permit must also memorialize that agreement to toll the statute of limitations, by signing an agreement to that effect, in exchange for the Corps acceptance of the after-the-fact permit application, and/or any administrative appeal (See 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(v)). No administrative appeal associated with an unauthorized activity or after-the-fact permit application will be accepted until such signed tolling agreement is furnished to the district engineer.

    § 331.12   Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

#### § § 331.12

    No affected party may file a legal action in the Federal courts based on a permit denial or a proffered permit until after a final Corps decision has been made and the appellant has exhausted all applicable administrative remedies under this part. The appellant is considered to have exhausted all administrative remedies when a final Corps permit decision is made in accordance with § 331.10.

  PART 332—COMPENSATORY MITIGATION FOR LOSSES OF AQUATIC RESOURCES

### Part 332

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 401  33 U.S.C. 1344; and Pub. L. 108-136.

**Source:** Source: 73 FR 19670, Apr. 10, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

    § 332.1   Purpose and general considerations.

#### § § 332.1

    (a)  (1) The purpose of this part is to establish standards and criteria for the use of all types of compensatory mitigation, including on-site and off-site permittee-responsible mitigation, mitigation banks, and in-lieu fee mitigation to offset unavoidable impacts to waters of the United States authorized through the issuance of Department of the Army (DA) permits pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) and/or sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401, 403). This part implements section 314(b) of the 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 108-136), which directs that the standards and criteria shall, to the maximum extent practicable, maximize available credits and opportunities for mitigation, provide for regional variations in wetland conditions, functions, and values, and apply equivalent standards and criteria to each type of compensatory mitigation. This part is intended to further clarify mitigation requirements established under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) regulations at 33 CFR part 320 and 40 CFR part 230, respectively.

    (2) This part has been jointly developed by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. From time to time guidance on interpreting and implementing this part may be prepared jointly by U.S. EPA and the Corps at the national or regional level. No modifications to the basic application, meaning, or intent of this part will be made without further joint rulemaking by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 ).

    (b)  This part does not alter the regulations at § 320.4(r) of this title, which address the general mitigation requirements for DA permits. In particular, it does not alter the circumstances under which compensatory mitigation is required or the definitions of “waters of the United States” or “navigable waters of the United States,” which are provided at parts 328 and 329 of this chapter, respectively. Use of resources as compensatory mitigation that are not otherwise subject to regulation under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 does not in and of itself make them subject to such regulation.

    (c)  (1) Nothing in this section affects the requirement that all DA permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act comply with applicable provisions of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines at 40 CFR part 230.

    (2) Pursuant to these requirements, the district engineer will issue an individual section 404 permit only upon a determination that the proposed discharge complies with applicable provisions of 40 CFR part 230, including those which require the permit applicant to take all appropriate and practicable steps to avoid and minimize adverse impacts to waters of the United States. Practicable means available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes. Compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts may be required to ensure that an activity requiring a section 404 permit complies with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines.

    (3) Compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts may be required to ensure that an activity requiring a section 404 permit complies with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. During the 404(b)(1) Guidelines compliance analysis, the district engineer may determine that a DA permit for the proposed activity cannot be issued because of the lack of appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation options.

    (d)  Compensatory mitigation may also be required to ensure that an activity requiring authorization under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 is not contrary to the public interest.

    (e)  Where appropriate, district engineers shall account for regional characteristics of aquatic resource types, functions and services when determining performance standards and monitoring requirements for compensatory mitigation projects.

    (f)  (1) This part applies instead of the “Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks,” which was issued on November 28, 1995, the “Federal Guidance on the Use of In-Lieu Fee Arrangements for Compensatory Mitigation Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act,” which was issued on November 7, 2000, and Regulatory Guidance Letter 02-02, “Guidance on Compensatory Mitigation Projects for Aquatic Resource Impacts Under the Corps Regulatory Program Pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899” which was issued on December 24, 2002. These guidance documents are no longer to be used as compensatory mitigation policy in the Corps Regulatory Program.

    (2) In addition, this part also applies instead of the provisions relating to the amount, type, and location of compensatory mitigation projects, including the use of preservation, in the February 6, 1990, Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Department of the Army and the Environmental Protection Agency on the Determination of Mitigation Under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. All other provisions of this MOA remain in effect.

    § 332.2   Definitions.

#### § § 332.2

    For the purposes of this part, the following terms are defined:

    means the development of a management strategy that anticipates likely challenges associated with compensatory mitigation projects and provides for the implementation of actions to address those challenges, as well as unforeseen changes to those projects. It requires consideration of the risk, uncertainty, and dynamic nature of compensatory mitigation projects and guides modification of those projects to optimize performance. It includes the selection of appropriate measures that will ensure that the aquatic resource functions are provided and involves analysis of monitoring results to identify potential problems of a compensatory mitigation project and the identification and implementation of measures to rectify those problems.

    means any credits of an approved in-lieu fee program that are available for sale prior to being fulfilled in accordance with an approved mitigation project plan. Advance credit sales require an approved in-lieu fee program instrument that meets all applicable requirements including a specific allocation of advance credits, by service area where applicable. The instrument must also contain a schedule for fulfillment of advance credit sales.

    means an upland, wetland, and/or riparian area that protects and/or enhances aquatic resource functions associated with wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, marine, and estuarine systems from disturbances associated with adjacent land uses.

    means the restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain circumstances preservation of aquatic resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.

    means compensatory mitigation implemented by the permittee as a requirement of a DA permit (, permittee-responsible mitigation), or by a mitigation bank or an in-lieu fee program.

    means the relative ability of an aquatic resource to support and maintain a community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to reference aquatic resources in the region.

    means a unit of measure (e.g., a functional or areal measure or other suitable metric) representing the accrual or attainment of aquatic functions at a compensatory mitigation site. The measure of aquatic functions is based on the resources restored, established, enhanced, or preserved.

    means Department of the Army.

    means calendar days.

    means a unit of measure (e.g., a functional or areal measure or other suitable metric) representing the loss of aquatic functions at an impact or project site. The measure of aquatic functions is based on the resources impacted by the authorized activity.

    means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of an aquatic resource to heighten, intensify, or improve a specific aquatic resource function(s). _Enhancement_ results in the gain of selected aquatic resource function(s), but may also lead to a decline in other aquatic resource function(s). Enhancement does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area.

    (creation) means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics present to develop an aquatic resource that did not previously exist at an upland site. _Establishment_ results in a gain in aquatic resource area and functions.

    means application of credits released in accordance with a credit release schedule in an approved mitigation project plan to satisfy the mitigation requirements represented by the advance credits. Only after any advance credit sales within a service area have been fulfilled through the application of released credits from an in-lieu fee project (in accordance with the credit release schedule for an approved mitigation project plan), may additional released credits from that project be sold or transferred to permittees. When advance credits are fulfilled, an equal number of new advance credits is restored to the program sponsor for sale or transfer to permit applicants.

    means the degree to which an area of aquatic resource performs a specific function.

    means the physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in ecosystems.

    means adverse effect.

    means a resource of a similar structural and functional type to the impacted resource.

    means a program involving the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a governmental or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits. Similar to a mitigation bank, an in-lieu fee program sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the in-lieu program sponsor. However, the rules governing the operation and use of in-lieu fee programs are somewhat different from the rules governing operation and use of mitigation banks. The operation and use of an in-lieu fee program are governed by an in-lieu fee program instrument.

    means the legal document for the establishment, operation, and use of an in-lieu fee program.

    means mitigation banking instrument or in-lieu fee program instrument.

    means an interagency group of federal, tribal, state, and/or local regulatory and resource agency representatives that reviews documentation for, and advises the district engineer on, the establishment and management of a mitigation bank or an in-lieu fee program.

    means a site, or suite of sites, where resources (e.g., wetlands, streams, riparian areas) are restored, established, enhanced, and/or preserved for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation for impacts authorized by DA permits. In general, a mitigation bank sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the mitigation bank sponsor. The operation and use of a mitigation bank are governed by a mitigation banking instrument.

    means the legal document for the establishment, operation, and use of a mitigation bank.

    means an area that is neither located on the same parcel of land as the impact site, nor on a parcel of land contiguous to the parcel containing the impact site.

    means an area located on the same parcel of land as the impact site, or on a parcel of land contiguous to the impact site.

    means a resource of a different structural and functional type from the impacted resource.

    are observable or measurable physical (including hydrological), chemical and/or biological attributes that are used to determine if a compensatory mitigation project meets its objectives.

    means an aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activity undertaken by the permittee (or an authorized agent or contractor) to provide compensatory mitigation for which the permittee retains full responsibility.

    means the removal of a threat to, or preventing the decline of, aquatic resources by an action in or near those aquatic resources. This term includes activities commonly associated with the protection and maintenance of aquatic resources through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms. _Preservation_ does not result in a gain of aquatic resource area or functions.

    means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former aquatic resource. _Re-establishment_ results in rebuilding a former aquatic resource and results in a gain in aquatic resource area and functions.

    are a set of aquatic resources that represent the full range of variability exhibited by a regional class of aquatic resources as a result of natural processes and anthropogenic disturbances.

    means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural/historic functions to a degraded aquatic resource. _Rehabilitation_ results in a gain in aquatic resource function, but does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area.

    means a determination by the district engineer, in consultation with the IRT, that credits associated with an approved mitigation plan are available for sale or transfer, or in the case of an in-lieu fee program, for fulfillment of advance credit sales. A proportion of projected credits for a specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project may be released upon approval of the mitigation plan, with additional credits released as milestones specified in the credit release schedule are achieved.

    means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former or degraded aquatic resource. For the purpose of tracking net gains in aquatic resource area, restoration is divided into two categories: re-establishment and rehabilitation.

    are lands adjacent to streams, rivers, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines. _Riparian areas_ provide a variety of ecological functions and services and help improve or maintain local water quality.

    means the geographic area within which impacts can be mitigated at a specific mitigation bank or an in-lieu fee program, as designated in its instrument.

    mean the benefits that human populations receive from functions that occur in ecosystems.

    means any public or private entity responsible for establishing, and in most circumstances, operating a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.

    means a standard, individual permit issued under the authority of section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.

    is the time lag between the loss of aquatic resource functions caused by the permitted impacts and the replacement of aquatic resource functions at the compensatory mitigation site. Higher compensation ratios may be required to compensate for temporal loss. When the compensatory mitigation project is initiated prior to, or concurrent with, the permitted impacts, the district engineer may determine that compensation for temporal loss is not necessary, unless the resource has a long development time.

    means a land area that drains to a common waterway, such as a stream, lake, estuary, wetland, or ultimately the ocean.

    means an analytical process for making compensatory mitigation decisions that support the sustainability or improvement of aquatic resources in a watershed. It involves consideration of watershed needs, and how locations and types of compensatory mitigation projects address those needs. A landscape perspective is used to identify the types and locations of compensatory mitigation projects that will benefit the watershed and offset losses of aquatic resource functions and services caused by activities authorized by DA permits. The watershed approach may involve consideration of landscape scale, historic and potential aquatic resource conditions, past and projected aquatic resource impacts in the watershed, and terrestrial connections between aquatic resources when determining compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits.

    means a plan developed by federal, tribal, state, and/or local government agencies or appropriate non-governmental organizations, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, for the specific goal of aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and preservation. A watershed plan addresses aquatic resource conditions in the watershed, multiple stakeholder interests, and land uses. _Watershed plan_s may also identify priority sites for aquatic resource restoration and protection. Examples of watershed plans include special area management plans, advance identification programs, and wetland management plans.

    § 332.3   General compensatory mitigation requirements.

#### § § 332.3

    (a)  (1) The fundamental objective of compensatory mitigation is to offset environmental losses resulting from unavoidable impacts to waters of the United States authorized by DA permits. The district engineer must determine the compensatory mitigation to be required in a DA permit, based on what is practicable and capable of compensating for the aquatic resource functions that will be lost as a result of the permitted activity. When evaluating compensatory mitigation options, the district engineer will consider what would be environmentally preferable. In making this determination, the district engineer must assess the likelihood for ecological success and sustainability, the location of the compensation site relative to the impact site and their significance within the watershed, and the costs of the compensatory mitigation project. In many cases, the environmentally preferable compensatory mitigation may be provided through mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs because they usually involve consolidating compensatory mitigation projects where ecologically appropriate, consolidating resources, providing financial planning and scientific expertise (which often is not practical for permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation projects), reducing temporal losses of functions, and reducing uncertainty over project success. Compensatory mitigation requirements must be commensurate with the amount and type of impact that is associated with a particular DA permit. Permit applicants are responsible for proposing an appropriate compensatory mitigation option to offset unavoidable impacts.

    (2) Compensatory mitigation may be performed using the methods of restoration, enhancement, establishment, and in certain circumstances preservation. Restoration should generally be the first option considered because the likelihood of success is greater and the impacts to potentially ecologically important uplands are reduced compared to establishment, and the potential gains in terms of aquatic resource functions are greater, compared to enhancement and preservation.

    (3) Compensatory mitigation projects may be sited on public or private lands. Credits for compensatory mitigation projects on public land must be based solely on aquatic resource functions provided by the compensatory mitigation project, over and above those provided by public programs already planned or in place. All compensatory mitigation projects must comply with the standards in this part, if they are to be used to provide compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by DA permits, regardless of whether they are sited on public or private lands and whether the sponsor is a governmental or private entity.

    (b)  (1) When considering options for successfully providing the required compensatory mitigation, the district engineer shall consider the type and location options in the order presented in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section. In general, the required compensatory mitigation should be located within the same watershed as the impact site, and should be located where it is most likely to successfully replace lost functions and services, taking into account such watershed scale features as aquatic habitat diversity, habitat connectivity, relationships to hydrologic sources (including the availability of water rights), trends in land use, ecological benefits, and compatibility with adjacent land uses. When compensating for impacts to marine resources, the location of the compensatory mitigation site should be chosen to replace lost functions and services within the same marine ecological system (e.g., reef complex, littoral drift cell). Compensation for impacts to aquatic resources in coastal watersheds (watersheds that include a tidal water body) should also be located in a coastal watershed where practicable. Compensatory mitigation projects should not be located where they will increase risks to aviation by attracting wildlife to areas where aircraft-wildlife strikes may occur (e.g., near airports).

    (2)  When permitted impacts are located within the service area of an approved mitigation bank, and the bank has the appropriate number and resource type of credits available, the permittee's compensatory mitigation requirements may be met by securing those credits from the sponsor. Since an approved instrument (including an approved mitigation plan and appropriate real estate and financial assurances) for a mitigation bank is required to be in place before its credits can begin to be used to compensate for authorized impacts, use of a mitigation bank can help reduce risk and uncertainty, as well as temporal loss of resource functions and services. Mitigation bank credits are not released for debiting until specific milestones associated with the mitigation bank site's protection and development are achieved, thus use of mitigation bank credits can also help reduce risk that mitigation will not be fully successful. Mitigation banks typically involve larger, more ecologically valuable parcels, and more rigorous scientific and technical analysis, planning and implementation than permittee-responsible mitigation. Also, development of a mitigation bank requires site identification in advance, project-specific planning, and significant investment of financial resources that is often not practicable for many in-lieu fee programs. For these reasons, the district engineer should give preference to the use of mitigation bank credits when these considerations are applicable. However, these same considerations may also be used to override this preference, where appropriate, as, for example, where an in-lieu fee program has released credits available from a specific approved in-lieu fee project, or a permittee-responsible project will restore an outstanding resource based on rigorous scientific and technical analysis.

    (3)  Where permitted impacts are located within the service area of an approved in-lieu fee program, and the sponsor has the appropriate number and resource type of credits available, the permittee's compensatory mitigation requirements may be met by securing those credits from the sponsor. Where permitted impacts are not located in the service area of an approved mitigation bank, or the approved mitigation bank does not have the appropriate number and resource type of credits available to offset those impacts, in-lieu fee mitigation, if available, is generally preferable to permittee-responsible mitigation. In-lieu fee projects typically involve larger, more ecologically valuable parcels, and more rigorous scientific and technical analysis, planning and implementation than permittee-responsible mitigation. They also devote significant resources to identifying and addressing high-priority resource needs on a watershed scale, as reflected in their compensation planning framework. For these reasons, the district engineer should give preference to in-lieu fee program credits over permittee-responsible mitigation, where these considerations are applicable. However, as with the preference for mitigation bank credits, these same considerations may be used to override this preference where appropriate. Additionally, in cases where permittee-responsible mitigation is likely to successfully meet performance standards before advance credits secured from an in-lieu fee program are fulfilled, the district engineer should also give consideration to this factor in deciding between in-lieu fee mitigation and permittee-responsible mitigation.

    (4)  Where permitted impacts are not in the service area of an approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program that has the appropriate number and resource type of credits available, permittee-responsible mitigation is the only option. Where practicable and likely to be successful and sustainable, the resource type and location for the required permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation should be determined using the principles of a watershed approach as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.

    (5)  In cases where a watershed approach is not practicable, the district engineer should consider opportunities to offset anticipated aquatic resource impacts by requiring on-site and in-kind compensatory mitigation. The district engineer must also consider the practicability of on-site compensatory mitigation and its compatibility with the proposed project.

    (6)  If, after considering opportunities for on-site, in-kind compensatory mitigation as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the district engineer determines that these compensatory mitigation opportunities are not practicable, are unlikely to compensate for the permitted impacts, or will be incompatible with the proposed project, and an alternative, practicable off-site and/or out-of-kind mitigation opportunity is identified that has a greater likelihood of offsetting the permitted impacts or is environmentally preferable to on-site or in-kind mitigation, the district engineer should require that this alternative compensatory mitigation be provided.

    (c)  (1) The district engineer must use a watershed approach to establish compensatory mitigation requirements in DA permits to the extent appropriate and practicable. Where a watershed plan is available, the district engineer will determine whether the plan is appropriate for use in the watershed approach for compensatory mitigation. In cases where the district engineer determines that an appropriate watershed plan is available, the watershed approach should be based on that plan. Where no such plan is available, the watershed approach should be based on information provided by the project sponsor or available from other sources. The ultimate goal of a watershed approach is to maintain and improve the quality and quantity of aquatic resources within watersheds through strategic selection of compensatory mitigation sites.

    (2)  (i) A watershed approach to compensatory mitigation considers the importance of landscape position and resource type of compensatory mitigation projects for the sustainability of aquatic resource functions within the watershed. Such an approach considers how the types and locations of compensatory mitigation projects will provide the desired aquatic resource functions, and will continue to function over time in a changing landscape. It also considers the habitat requirements of important species, habitat loss or conversion trends, sources of watershed impairment, and current development trends, as well as the requirements of other regulatory and non-regulatory programs that affect the watershed, such as storm water management or habitat conservation programs. It includes the protection and maintenance of terrestrial resources, such as non-wetland riparian areas and uplands, when those resources contribute to or improve the overall ecological functioning of aquatic resources in the watershed. Compensatory mitigation requirements determined through the watershed approach should not focus exclusively on specific functions (e.g., water quality or habitat for certain species), but should provide, where practicable, the suite of functions typically provided by the affected aquatic resource.

    (ii) Locational factors (e.g., hydrology, surrounding land use) are important to the success of compensatory mitigation for impacted habitat functions and may lead to siting of such mitigation away from the project area. However, consideration should also be given to functions and services (e.g., water quality, flood control, shoreline protection) that will likely need to be addressed at or near the areas impacted by the permitted impacts.

    (iii) A watershed approach may include on-site compensatory mitigation, off-site compensatory mitigation (including mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs), or a combination of on-site and off-site compensatory mitigation.

    (iv) A watershed approach to compensatory mitigation should include, to the extent practicable, inventories of historic and existing aquatic resources, including identification of degraded aquatic resources, and identification of immediate and long-term aquatic resource needs within watersheds that can be met through permittee-responsible mitigation projects, mitigation banks, or in-lieu fee programs. Planning efforts should identify and prioritize aquatic resource restoration, establishment, and enhancement activities, and preservation of existing aquatic resources that are important for maintaining or improving ecological functions of the watershed. The identification and prioritization of resource needs should be as specific as possible, to enhance the usefulness of the approach in determining compensatory mitigation requirements.

    (v) A watershed approach is not appropriate in areas where watershed boundaries do not exist, such as marine areas. In such cases, an appropriate spatial scale should be used to replace lost functions and services within the same ecological system (e.g., reef complex, littoral drift cell).

    (3)  (i) In the absence of a watershed plan determined by the district engineer under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be appropriate for use in the watershed approach, the district engineer will use a watershed approach based on analysis of information regarding watershed conditions and needs, including potential sites for aquatic resource restoration activities and priorities for aquatic resource restoration and preservation. Such information includes: current trends in habitat loss or conversion; cumulative impacts of past development activities, current development trends, the presence and needs of sensitive species; site conditions that favor or hinder the success of compensatory mitigation projects; and chronic environmental problems such as flooding or poor water quality.

    (ii) This information may be available from sources such as wetland maps; soil surveys; U.S. Geological Survey topographic and hydrologic maps; aerial photographs; information on rare, endangered and threatened species and critical habitat; local ecological reports or studies; and other information sources that could be used to identify locations for suitable compensatory mitigation projects in the watershed.

    (iii) The level of information and analysis needed to support a watershed approach must be commensurate with the scope and scale of the proposed impacts requiring a DA permit, as well as the functions lost as a result of those impacts.

    (4)  The size of watershed addressed using a watershed approach should not be larger than is appropriate to ensure that the aquatic resources provided through compensation activities will effectively compensate for adverse environmental impacts resulting from activities authorized by DA permits. The district engineer should consider relevant environmental factors and appropriate locally developed standards and criteria when determining the appropriate watershed scale in guiding compensation activities.

    (d)  (1) The compensatory mitigation project site must be ecologically suitable for providing the desired aquatic resource functions. In determining the ecological suitability of the compensatory mitigation project site, the district engineer must consider, to the extent practicable, the following factors:

    (i) Hydrological conditions, soil characteristics, and other physical and chemical characteristics;

    (ii) Watershed-scale features, such as aquatic habitat diversity, habitat connectivity, and other landscape scale functions;

    (iii) The size and location of the compensatory mitigation site relative to hydrologic sources (including the availability of water rights) and other ecological features;

    (iv) Compatibility with adjacent land uses and watershed management plans;

    (v) Reasonably foreseeable effects the compensatory mitigation project will have on ecologically important aquatic or terrestrial resources (e.g., shallow sub-tidal habitat, mature forests), cultural sites, or habitat for federally- or state-listed threatened and endangered species; and

    (vi) Other relevant factors including, but not limited to, development trends, anticipated land use changes, habitat status and trends, the relative locations of the impact and mitigation sites in the stream network, local or regional goals for the restoration or protection of particular habitat types or functions (e.g., re-establishment of habitat corridors or habitat for species of concern), water quality goals, floodplain management goals, and the relative potential for chemical contamination of the aquatic resources.

    (2) District engineers may require on-site, off-site, or a combination of on-site and off-site compensatory mitigation to replace permitted losses of aquatic resource functions and services.

    (3) Applicants should propose compensation sites adjacent to existing aquatic resources or where aquatic resources previously existed.

    (e)  (1) In general, in-kind mitigation is preferable to out-of-kind mitigation because it is most likely to compensate for the functions and services lost at the impact site. For example, tidal wetland compensatory mitigation projects are most likely to compensate for unavoidable impacts to tidal wetlands, while perennial stream compensatory mitigation projects are most likely to compensate for unavoidable impacts to perennial streams. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the required compensatory mitigation shall be of a similar type to the affected aquatic resource.

    (2) If the district engineer determines, using the watershed approach in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section that out-of-kind compensatory mitigation will serve the aquatic resource needs of the watershed, the district engineer may authorize the use of such out-of-kind compensatory mitigation. The basis for authorization of out-of-kind compensatory mitigation must be documented in the administrative record for the permit action.

    (3) For difficult-to-replace resources (e.g., bogs, fens, springs, streams, Atlantic white cedar swamps) if further avoidance and minimization is not practicable, the required compensation should be provided, if practicable, through in-kind rehabilitation, enhancement, or preservation since there is greater certainty that these methods of compensation will successfully offset permitted impacts.

    (f)  (1) If the district engineer determines that compensatory mitigation is necessary to offset unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources, the amount of required compensatory mitigation must be, to the extent practicable, sufficient to replace lost aquatic resource functions. In cases where appropriate functional or condition assessment methods or other suitable metrics are available, these methods should be used where practicable to determine how much compensatory mitigation is required. If a functional or condition assessment or other suitable metric is not used, a minimum one-to-one acreage or linear foot compensation ratio must be used.

    (2) The district engineer must require a mitigation ratio greater than one-to-one where necessary to account for the method of compensatory mitigation (e.g., preservation), the likelihood of success, differences between the functions lost at the impact site and the functions expected to be produced by the compensatory mitigation project, temporal losses of aquatic resource functions, the difficulty of restoring or establishing the desired aquatic resource type and functions, and/or the distance between the affected aquatic resource and the compensation site. The rationale for the required replacement ratio must be documented in the administrative record for the permit action.

    (3) If an in-lieu fee program will be used to provide the required compensatory mitigation, and the appropriate number and resource type of released credits are not available, the district engineer must require sufficient compensation to account for the risk and uncertainty associated with in-lieu fee projects that have not been implemented before the permitted impacts have occurred.

    (g)  Mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs may be used to compensate for impacts to aquatic resources authorized by general permits and individual permits, including after-the-fact permits, in accordance with the preference hierarchy in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (h)  (1) Preservation may be used to provide compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by DA permits when all the following criteria are met:

    (i) The resources to be preserved provide important physical, chemical, or biological functions for the watershed;

    (ii) The resources to be preserved contribute significantly to the ecological sustainability of the watershed. In determining the contribution of those resources to the ecological sustainability of the watershed, the district engineer must use appropriate quantitative assessment tools, where available;

    (iii) Preservation is determined by the district engineer to be appropriate and practicable;

    (iv) The resources are under threat of destruction or adverse modifications; and

    (v) The preserved site will be permanently protected through an appropriate real estate or other legal instrument (e.g., easement, title transfer to state resource agency or land trust).

    (2) Where preservation is used to provide compensatory mitigation, to the extent appropriate and practicable the preservation shall be done in conjunction with aquatic resource restoration, establishment, and/or enhancement activities. This requirement may be waived by the district engineer where preservation has been identified as a high priority using a watershed approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, but compensation ratios shall be higher.

    (i)  District engineers may require the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and preservation, as well as the maintenance, of riparian areas and/or buffers around aquatic resources where necessary to ensure the long-term viability of those resources. Buffers may also provide habitat or corridors necessary for the ecological functioning of aquatic resources. If buffers are required by the district engineer as part of the compensatory mitigation project, compensatory mitigation credit will be provided for those buffers.

    (j)  (1) Compensatory mitigation projects for DA permits may also be used to satisfy the environmental requirements of other programs, such as tribal, state, or local wetlands regulatory programs, other federal programs such as the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Corps civil works projects, and Department of Defense military construction projects, consistent with the terms and requirements of these programs and subject to the following considerations:

    (i) The compensatory mitigation project must include appropriate compensation required by the DA permit for unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources authorized by that permit.

    (ii) Under no circumstances may the same credits be used to provide mitigation for more than one permitted activity. However, where appropriate, compensatory mitigation projects, including mitigation banks and in-lieu fee projects, may be designed to holistically address requirements under multiple programs and authorities for the same activity.

    (2) Except for projects undertaken by federal agencies, or where federal funding is specifically authorized to provide compensatory mitigation, federally-funded aquatic resource restoration or conservation projects undertaken for purposes other than compensatory mitigation, such as the Wetlands Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Program, and Partners for Wildlife Program activities, cannot be used for the purpose of generating compensatory mitigation credits for activities authorized by DA permits. However, compensatory mitigation credits may be generated by activities undertaken in conjunction with, but supplemental to, such programs in order to maximize the overall ecological benefits of the restoration or conservation project.

    (3) Compensatory mitigation projects may also be used to provide compensatory mitigation under the Endangered Species Act or for Habitat Conservation Plans, as long as they comply with the requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

    (k)  (1) The compensatory mitigation requirements for a DA permit, including the amount and type of compensatory mitigation, must be clearly stated in the special conditions of the individual permit or general permit verification (see 33 CFR 325.4 and 330.6(a)). The special conditions must be enforceable.

    (2) For an individual permit that requires permittee-responsible mitigation, the special conditions must:

    (i) Identify the party responsible for providing the compensatory mitigation;

    (ii) Incorporate, by reference, the final mitigation plan approved by the district engineer;

    (iii) State the objectives, performance standards, and monitoring required for the compensatory mitigation project, unless they are provided in the approved final mitigation plan; and

    (iv) Describe any required financial assurances or long-term management provisions for the compensatory mitigation project, unless they are specified in the approved final mitigation plan.

    (3) For a general permit activity that requires permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation, the special conditions must describe the compensatory mitigation proposal, which may be either conceptual or detailed. The general permit verification must also include a special condition that states that the permittee cannot commence work in waters of the United States until the district engineer approves the final mitigation plan, unless the district engineer determines that such a special condition is not practicable and not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation. To the extent appropriate and practicable, special conditions of the general permit verification should also address the requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section.

    (4) If a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is used to provide the required compensatory mitigation, the special conditions must indicate whether a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program will be used, and specify the number and resource type of credits the permittee is required to secure. In the case of an individual permit, the special condition must also identify the specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program that will be used. For general permit verifications, the special conditions may either identify the specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, or state that the specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program used to provide the required compensatory mitigation must be approved by the district engineer before the credits are secured.

    (l)  (1) For permittee-responsible mitigation, the special conditions of the DA permit must clearly indicate the party or parties responsible for the implementation, performance, and long-term management of the compensatory mitigation project.

    (2) For mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs, the instrument must clearly indicate the party or parties responsible for the implementation, performance, and long-term management of the compensatory mitigation project(s). The instrument must also contain a provision expressing the sponsor's agreement to assume responsibility for a permittee's compensatory mitigation requirements, once that permittee has secured the appropriate number and resource type of credits from the sponsor and the district engineer has received the documentation described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.

    (3) If use of a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is approved by the district engineer to provide part or all of the required compensatory mitigation for a DA permit, the permittee retains responsibility for providing the compensatory mitigation until the appropriate number and resource type of credits have been secured from a sponsor and the district engineer has received documentation that confirms that the sponsor has accepted the responsibility for providing the required compensatory mitigation. This documentation may consist of a letter or form signed by the sponsor, with the permit number and a statement indicating the number and resource type of credits that have been secured from the sponsor. Copies of this documentation will be retained in the administrative records for both the permit and the instrument. If the sponsor fails to provide the required compensatory mitigation, the district engineer may pursue measures against the sponsor to ensure compliance.

    (m)  Implementation of the compensatory mitigation project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the activity causing the authorized impacts. The district engineer shall require, to the extent appropriate and practicable, additional compensatory mitigation to offset temporal losses of aquatic functions that will result from the permitted activity.

    (n)  (1) The district engineer shall require sufficient financial assurances to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation project will be successfully completed, in accordance with applicable performance standards. In cases where an alternate mechanism is available to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation will be provided and maintained (e.g., a formal, documented commitment from a government agency or public authority) the district engineer may determine that financial assurances are not necessary for that compensatory mitigation project.

    (2) The amount of the required financial assurances must be determined by the district engineer, in consultation with the project sponsor, and must be based on the size and complexity of the compensatory mitigation project, the degree of completion of the project at the time of project approval, the likelihood of success, the past performance of the project sponsor, and any other factors the district engineer deems appropriate. Financial assurances may be in the form of performance bonds, escrow accounts, casualty insurance, letters of credit, legislative appropriations for government sponsored projects, or other appropriate instruments, subject to the approval of the district engineer. The rationale for determining the amount of the required financial assurances must be documented in the administrative record for either the DA permit or the instrument. In determining the assurance amount, the district engineer shall consider the cost of providing replacement mitigation, including costs for land acquisition, planning and engineering, legal fees, mobilization, construction, and monitoring.

    (3) If financial assurances are required, the DA permit must include a special condition requiring the financial assurances to be in place prior to commencing the permitted activity.

    (4) Financial assurances shall be phased out once the compensatory mitigation project has been determined by the district engineer to be successful in accordance with its performance standards. The DA permit or instrument must clearly specify the conditions under which the financial assurances are to be released to the permittee, sponsor, and/or other financial assurance provider, including, as appropriate, linkage to achievement of performance standards, adaptive management, or compliance with special conditions.

    (5) A financial assurance must be in a form that ensures that the district engineer will receive notification at least 120 days in advance of any termination or revocation. For third-party assurance providers, this may take the form of a contractual requirement for the assurance provider to notify the district engineer at least 120 days before the assurance is revoked or terminated.

    (6) Financial assurances shall be payable at the direction of the district engineer to his designee or to a standby trust agreement. When a standby trust is used (e.g., with performance bonds or letters of credit) all amounts paid by the financial assurance provider shall be deposited directly into the standby trust fund for distribution by the trustee in accordance with the district engineer's instructions.

    (o)  The compensatory mitigation project must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The DA permit, mitigation banking instrument, or in-lieu fee program instrument must not require participation by the Corps or any other federal agency in project management, including receipt or management of financial assurances or long-term financing mechanisms, except as determined by the Corps or other agency to be consistent with its statutory authority, mission, and priorities.

    § 332.4   Planning and documentation.

#### § § 332.4

    (a)  Potential applicants for standard permits are encouraged to participate in pre-application meetings with the Corps and appropriate agencies to discuss potential mitigation requirements and information needs.

    (b)  (1) For an activity that requires a standard DA permit pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the public notice for the proposed activity must contain a statement explaining how impacts associated with the proposed activity are to be avoided, minimized, and compensated for. This explanation shall address, to the extent that such information is provided in the mitigation statement required by § 325.1(d)(7) of this chapter, the proposed avoidance and minimization and the amount, type, and location of any proposed compensatory mitigation, including any out-of-kind compensation, or indicate an intention to use an approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program. The level of detail provided in the public notice must be commensurate with the scope and scale of the impacts. The notice shall not include information that the district engineer and the permittee believe should be kept confidential for business purposes, such as the exact location of a proposed mitigation site that has not yet been secured. The permittee must clearly identify any information being claimed as confidential in the mitigation statement when submitted. In such cases, the notice must still provide enough information to enable the public to provide meaningful comment on the proposed mitigation.

    (2) For individual permits, district engineers must consider any timely comments and recommendations from other federal agencies; tribal, state, or local governments; and the public.

    (3) For activities authorized by letters of permission or general permits, the review and approval process for compensatory mitigation proposals and plans must be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of those permits and applicable regulations including the applicable provisions of this part.

    (c) —(1)  (i) For individual permits, the permittee must prepare a draft mitigation plan and submit it to the district engineer for review. After addressing any comments provided by the district engineer, the permittee must prepare a final mitigation plan, which must be approved by the district engineer prior to issuing the individual permit. The approved final mitigation plan must be incorporated into the individual permit by reference. The final mitigation plan must include the items described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(14) of this section, but the level of detail of the mitigation plan should be commensurate with the scale and scope of the impacts. As an alternative, the district engineer may determine that it would be more appropriate to address any of the items described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(14) of this section as permit conditions, instead of components of a compensatory mitigation plan. For permittees who intend to fulfill their compensatory mitigation obligations by securing credits from approved mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs, their mitigation plans need include only the items described in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section, and the name of the specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program to be used.

    (ii) For general permits, if compensatory mitigation is required, the district engineer may approve a conceptual or detailed compensatory mitigation plan to meet required time frames for general permit verifications, but a final mitigation plan incorporating the elements in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(14) of this section, at a level of detail commensurate with the scale and scope of the impacts, must be approved by the district engineer before the permittee commences work in waters of the United States. As an alternative, the district engineer may determine that it would be more appropriate to address any of the items described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(14) of this section as permit conditions, instead of components of a compensatory mitigation plan. For permittees who intend to fulfill their compensatory mitigation obligations by securing credits from approved mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs, their mitigation plans need include only the items described in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section, and either the name of the specific mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program to be used or a statement indicating that a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program will be used (contingent upon approval by the district engineer).

    (iii) Mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs must prepare a mitigation plan including the items in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(14) of this section for each separate compensatory mitigation project site. For mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs, the preparation and approval process for mitigation plans is described in § 332.8.

    (2)  A description of the resource type(s) and amount(s) that will be provided, the method of compensation (, restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation), and the manner in which the resource functions of the compensatory mitigation project will address the needs of the watershed, ecoregion, physiographic province, or other geographic area of interest.

    (3)  A description of the factors considered during the site selection process. This should include consideration of watershed needs, on-site alternatives where applicable, and the practicability of accomplishing ecologically self-sustaining aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation at the compensatory mitigation project site. (See § 332.3(d).)

    (4)  A description of the legal arrangements and instrument, including site ownership, that will be used to ensure the long-term protection of the compensatory mitigation project site (see § 332.7(a)).

    (5)  A description of the ecological characteristics of the proposed compensatory mitigation project site and, in the case of an application for a DA permit, the impact site. This may include descriptions of historic and existing plant communities, historic and existing hydrology, soil conditions, a map showing the locations of the impact and mitigation site(s) or the geographic coordinates for those site(s), and other site characteristics appropriate to the type of resource proposed as compensation. The baseline information should also include a delineation of waters of the United States on the proposed compensatory mitigation project site. A prospective permittee planning to secure credits from an approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program only needs to provide baseline information about the impact site, not the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project site.

    (6)  A description of the number of credits to be provided, including a brief explanation of the rationale for this determination. (See § 332.3(f).)

    (i) For permittee-responsible mitigation, this should include an explanation of how the compensatory mitigation project will provide the required compensation for unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources resulting from the permitted activity.

    (ii) For permittees intending to secure credits from an approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, it should include the number and resource type of credits to be secured and how these were determined.

    (7)  Detailed written specifications and work descriptions for the compensatory mitigation project, including, but not limited to, the geographic boundaries of the project; construction methods, timing, and sequence; source(s) of water, including connections to existing waters and uplands; methods for establishing the desired plant community; plans to control invasive plant species; the proposed grading plan, including elevations and slopes of the substrate; soil management; and erosion control measures. For stream compensatory mitigation projects, the mitigation work plan may also include other relevant information, such as planform geometry, channel form (e.g., typical channel cross-sections), watershed size, design discharge, and riparian area plantings.

    (8)  A description and schedule of maintenance requirements to ensure the continued viability of the resource once initial construction is completed.

    (9)  Ecologically-based standards that will be used to determine whether the compensatory mitigation project is achieving its objectives. (See § 332.5.)

    (10)  A description of parameters to be monitored in order to determine if the compensatory mitigation project is on track to meet performance standards and if adaptive management is needed. A schedule for monitoring and reporting on monitoring results to the district engineer must be included. (See § 332.6.)

    (11)  A description of how the compensatory mitigation project will be managed after performance standards have been achieved to ensure the long-term sustainability of the resource, including long-term financing mechanisms and the party responsible for long-term management. (See § 332.7(d).)

    (12)  A management strategy to address unforeseen changes in site conditions or other components of the compensatory mitigation project, including the party or parties responsible for implementing adaptive management measures. The adaptive management plan will guide decisions for revising compensatory mitigation plans and implementing measures to address both foreseeable and unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect compensatory mitigation success. (See § 332.7(c).)

    (13)  A description of financial assurances that will be provided and how they are sufficient to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation project will be successfully completed, in accordance with its performance standards (see § 332.3(n)).

    (14)  The district engineer may require additional information as necessary to determine the appropriateness, feasibility, and practicability of the compensatory mitigation project.

    § 332.5   Ecological performance standards.

#### § § 332.5

    (a) The approved mitigation plan must contain performance standards that will be used to assess whether the project is achieving its objectives. Performance standards should relate to the objectives of the compensatory mitigation project, so that the project can be objectively evaluated to determine if it is developing into the desired resource type, providing the expected functions, and attaining any other applicable metrics (e.g., acres).

    (b) Performance standards must be based on attributes that are objective and verifiable. Ecological performance standards must be based on the best available science that can be measured or assessed in a practicable manner. Performance standards may be based on variables or measures of functional capacity described in functional assessment methodologies, measurements of hydrology or other aquatic resource characteristics, and/or comparisons to reference aquatic resources of similar type and landscape position. The use of reference aquatic resources to establish performance standards will help ensure that those performance standards are reasonably achievable, by reflecting the range of variability exhibited by the regional class of aquatic resources as a result of natural processes and anthropogenic disturbances. Performance standards based on measurements of hydrology should take into consideration the hydrologic variability exhibited by reference aquatic resources, especially wetlands. Where practicable, performance standards should take into account the expected stages of the aquatic resource development process, in order to allow early identification of potential problems and appropriate adaptive management.

    § 332.6   Monitoring.

#### § § 332.6

    (a)  (1) Monitoring the compensatory mitigation project site is necessary to determine if the project is meeting its performance standards, and to determine if measures are necessary to ensure that the compensatory mitigation project is accomplishing its objectives. The submission of monitoring reports to assess the development and condition of the compensatory mitigation project is required, but the content and level of detail for those monitoring reports must be commensurate with the scale and scope of the compensatory mitigation project, as well as the compensatory mitigation project type. The mitigation plan must address the monitoring requirements for the compensatory mitigation project, including the parameters to be monitored, the length of the monitoring period, the party responsible for conducting the monitoring, the frequency for submitting monitoring reports to the district engineer, and the party responsible for submitting those monitoring reports to the district engineer.

    (2) The district engineer may conduct site inspections on a regular basis (e.g., annually) during the monitoring period to evaluate mitigation site performance.

    (b)  The mitigation plan must provide for a monitoring period that is sufficient to demonstrate that the compensatory mitigation project has met performance standards, but not less than five years. A longer monitoring period must be required for aquatic resources with slow development rates (e.g., forested wetlands, bogs). Following project implementation, the district engineer may reduce or waive the remaining monitoring requirements upon a determination that the compensatory mitigation project has achieved its performance standards. Conversely the district engineer may extend the original monitoring period upon a determination that performance standards have not been met or the compensatory mitigation project is not on track to meet them. The district engineer may also revise monitoring requirements when remediation and/or adaptive management is required.

    (c)  (1) The district engineer must determine the information to be included in monitoring reports. This information must be sufficient for the district engineer to determine how the compensatory mitigation project is progressing towards meeting its performance standards, and may include plans (such as as-built plans), maps, and photographs to illustrate site conditions. Monitoring reports may also include the results of functional, condition, or other assessments used to provide quantitative or qualitative measures of the functions provided by the compensatory mitigation project site.

    (2) The permittee or sponsor is responsible for submitting monitoring reports in accordance with the special conditions of the DA permit or the terms of the instrument. Failure to submit monitoring reports in a timely manner may result in compliance action by the district engineer.

    (3) Monitoring reports must be provided by the district engineer to interested federal, tribal, state, and local resource agencies, and the public, upon request.

    § 332.7   Management.

#### § § 332.7

    (a)  (1) The aquatic habitats, riparian areas, buffers, and uplands that comprise the overall compensatory mitigation project must be provided long-term protection through real estate instruments or other available mechanisms, as appropriate. Long-term protection may be provided through real estate instruments such as conservation easements held by entities such as federal, tribal, state, or local resource agencies, non-profit conservation organizations, or private land managers; the transfer of title to such entities; or by restrictive covenants. For government property, long-term protection may be provided through federal facility management plans or integrated natural resources management plans. When approving a method for long-term protection of non-government property other than transfer of title, the district engineer shall consider relevant legal constraints on the use of conservation easements and/or restrictive covenants in determining whether such mechanisms provide sufficient site protection. To provide sufficient site protection, a conservation easement or restrictive covenant should, where practicable, establish in an appropriate third party (e.g., governmental or non-profit resource management agency) the right to enforce site protections and provide the third party the resources necessary to monitor and enforce these site protections.

    (2) The real estate instrument, management plan, or other mechanism providing long-term protection of the compensatory mitigation site must, to the extent appropriate and practicable, prohibit incompatible uses (e.g., clear cutting or mineral extraction) that might otherwise jeopardize the objectives of the compensatory mitigation project. Where appropriate, multiple instruments recognizing compatible uses (e.g., fishing or grazing rights) may be used.

    (3) The real estate instrument, management plan, or other long-term protection mechanism must contain a provision requiring 60-day advance notification to the district engineer before any action is taken to void or modify the instrument, management plan, or long-term protection mechanism, including transfer of title to, or establishment of any other legal claims over, the compensatory mitigation site.

    (4) For compensatory mitigation projects on public lands, where federal facility management plans or integrated natural resources management plans are used to provide long-term protection, and changes in statute, regulation, or agency needs or mission results in an incompatible use on public lands originally set aside for compensatory mitigation, the public agency authorizing the incompatible use is responsible for providing alternative compensatory mitigation that is acceptable to the district engineer for any loss in functions resulting from the incompatible use.

    (5) A real estate instrument, management plan, or other long-term protection mechanism used for site protection of permittee-responsible mitigation must be approved by the district engineer in advance of, or concurrent with, the activity causing the authorized impacts.

    (b)  Compensatory mitigation projects shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to be self-sustaining once performance standards have been achieved. This includes minimization of active engineering features (e.g., pumps) and appropriate siting to ensure that natural hydrology and landscape context will support long-term sustainability. Where active long-term management and maintenance are necessary to ensure long-term sustainability (e.g., prescribed burning, invasive species control, maintenance of water control structures, easement enforcement), the responsible party must provide for such management and maintenance. This includes the provision of long-term financing mechanisms where necessary. Where needed, the acquisition and protection of water rights must be secured and documented in the permit conditions or instrument.

    (c)  (1) If the compensatory mitigation project cannot be constructed in accordance with the approved mitigation plans, the permittee or sponsor must notify the district engineer. A significant modification of the compensatory mitigation project requires approval from the district engineer.

    (2) If monitoring or other information indicates that the compensatory mitigation project is not progressing towards meeting its performance standards as anticipated, the responsible party must notify the district engineer as soon as possible. The district engineer will evaluate and pursue measures to address deficiencies in the compensatory mitigation project. The district engineer will consider whether the compensatory mitigation project is providing ecological benefits comparable to the original objectives of the compensatory mitigation project.

    (3) The district engineer, in consultation with the responsible party (and other federal, tribal, state, and local agencies, as appropriate), will determine the appropriate measures. The measures may include site modifications, design changes, revisions to maintenance requirements, and revised monitoring requirements. The measures must be designed to ensure that the modified compensatory mitigation project provides aquatic resource functions comparable to those described in the mitigation plan objectives.

    (4) Performance standards may be revised in accordance with adaptive management to account for measures taken to address deficiencies in the compensatory mitigation project. Performance standards may also be revised to reflect changes in management strategies and objectives if the new standards provide for ecological benefits that are comparable or superior to the approved compensatory mitigation project. No other revisions to performance standards will be allowed except in the case of natural disasters.

    (d)  (1) The permit conditions or instrument must identify the party responsible for ownership and all long-term management of the compensatory mitigation project. The permit conditions or instrument may contain provisions allowing the permittee or sponsor to transfer the long-term management responsibilities of the compensatory mitigation project site to a land stewardship entity, such as a public agency, non-governmental organization, or private land manager, after review and approval by the district engineer. The land stewardship entity need not be identified in the original permit or instrument, as long as the future transfer of long-term management responsibility is approved by the district engineer.

    (2) A long-term management plan should include a description of long-term management needs, annual cost estimates for these needs, and identify the funding mechanism that will be used to meet those needs.

    (3) Any provisions necessary for long-term financing must be addressed in the original permit or instrument. The district engineer may require provisions to address inflationary adjustments and other contingencies, as appropriate. Appropriate long-term financing mechanisms include non-wasting endowments, trusts, contractual arrangements with future responsible parties, and other appropriate financial instruments. In cases where the long-term management entity is a public authority or government agency, that entity must provide a plan for the long-term financing of the site.

    (4) For permittee-responsible mitigation, any long-term financing mechanisms must be approved in advance of the activity causing the authorized impacts.

    § 332.8   Mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs.

#### § § 332.8

    (a)  (1) All mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs must have an approved instrument signed by the sponsor and the district engineer prior to being used to provide compensatory mitigation for DA permits.

    (2) To the maximum extent practicable, mitigation banks and in-lieu fee project sites must be planned and designed to be self-sustaining over time, but some active management and maintenance may be required to ensure their long-term viability and sustainability. Examples of acceptable management activities include maintaining fire-dependent habitat communities in the absence of natural fire and controlling invasive exotic plant species.

    (3) All mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs must comply with the standards in this part, if they are to be used to provide compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by DA permits, regardless of whether they are sited on public or private lands and whether the sponsor is a governmental or private entity.

    (b)  (1) The district engineer will establish an Interagency Review Team (IRT) to review documentation for the establishment and management of mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs. The district engineer or his designated representative serves as Chair of the IRT. In cases where a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is proposed to satisfy the requirements of another federal, tribal, state, or local program, in addition to compensatory mitigation requirements of DA permits, it may be appropriate for the administering agency to serve as co-Chair of the IRT.

    (2) In addition to the Corps, representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA Fisheries, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and other federal agencies, as appropriate, may participate in the IRT. The IRT may also include representatives from tribal, state, and local regulatory and resource agencies, where such agencies have authorities and/or mandates directly affecting, or affected by, the establishment, operation, or use of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program. The district engineer will seek to include all public agencies with a substantive interest in the establishment of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program on the IRT, but retains final authority over its composition.

    (3) The primary role of the IRT is to facilitate the establishment of mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs through the development of mitigation banking or in-lieu fee program instruments. The IRT will review the prospectus, instrument, and other appropriate documents and provide comments to the district engineer. The district engineer and the IRT should use a watershed approach to the extent practicable in reviewing proposed mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs. Members of the IRT may also sign the instrument, if they so choose. By signing the instrument, the IRT members indicate their agreement with the terms of the instrument. As an alternative, a member of the IRT may submit a letter expressing concurrence with the instrument. The IRT will also advise the district engineer in assessing monitoring reports, recommending remedial or adaptive management measures, approving credit releases, and approving modifications to an instrument. In order to ensure timely processing of instruments and other documentation, comments from IRT members must be received by the district engineer within the time limits specified in this section. Comments received after these deadlines will only be considered at the discretion of the district engineer to the extent that doing so does not jeopardize the deadlines for district engineer action.

    (4) The district engineer will give full consideration to any timely comments and advice of the IRT. The district engineer alone retains final authority for approval of the instrument in cases where the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is used to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements of DA permits.

    (5)  The district engineer and members of the IRT may enter into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with any other federal, state or local government agency to perform all or some of the IRT review functions described in this section. Such MOAs must include provisions for appropriate federal oversight of the review process. The district engineer retains sole authority for final approval of instruments and other documentation required under this section.

    (c)  (1) The approved instrument for an in-lieu fee program must include a compensation planning framework that will be used to select, secure, and implement aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activities. The compensation planning framework must support a watershed approach to compensatory mitigation. All specific projects used to provide compensation for DA permits must be consistent with the approved compensation planning framework. Modifications to the framework must be approved as a significant modification to the instrument by the district engineer, after consultation with the IRT.

    (2) The compensation planning framework must contain the following elements:

    (i) The geographic service area(s), including a watershed-based rationale for the delineation of each service area;

    (ii) A description of the threats to aquatic resources in the service area(s), including how the in-lieu fee program will help offset impacts resulting from those threats;

    (iii) An analysis of historic aquatic resource loss in the service area(s);

    (iv) An analysis of current aquatic resource conditions in the service area(s), supported by an appropriate level of field documentation;

    (v) A statement of aquatic resource goals and objectives for each service area, including a description of the general amounts, types and locations of aquatic resources the program will seek to provide;

    (vi) A prioritization strategy for selecting and implementing compensatory mitigation activities;

    (vii) An explanation of how any preservation objectives identified in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section and addressed in the prioritization strategy in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) satisfy the criteria for use of preservation in § 332.3(h);

    (viii) A description of any public and private stakeholder involvement in plan development and implementation, including, where appropriate, coordination with federal, state, tribal and local aquatic resource management and regulatory authorities;

    (ix) A description of the long-term protection and management strategies for activities conducted by the in-lieu fee program sponsor;

    (x) A strategy for periodic evaluation and reporting on the progress of the program in achieving the goals and objectives in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, including a process for revising the planning framework as necessary; and

    (xi) Any other information deemed necessary for effective compensation planning by the district engineer.

    (3) The level of detail necessary for the compensation planning framework is at the discretion of the district engineer, and will take into account the characteristics of the service area(s) and the scope of the program. As part of the in-lieu fee program instrument, the compensation planning framework will be reviewed by the IRT, and will be a major factor in the district engineer's decision on whether to approve the instrument.

    (d)  (1) The sponsor is responsible for preparing all documentation associated with establishment of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, including the prospectus, instrument, and other appropriate documents, such as mitigation plans for a mitigation bank. The prospectus provides an overview of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program and serves as the basis for public and initial IRT comment. For a mitigation bank, the mitigation plan, as described in § 332.4(c), provides detailed plans and specifications for the mitigation bank site. For in-lieu fee programs, mitigation plans will be prepared as in-lieu fee project sites are identified after the instrument has been approved and the in-lieu fee program becomes operational. The instrument provides the authorization for the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program to provide credits to be used as compensatory mitigation for DA permits.

    (2)  The prospectus must provide a summary of the information regarding the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, at a sufficient level of detail to support informed public and IRT comment. The review process begins when the sponsor submits a complete prospectus to the district engineer. For modifications of approved instruments, submittal of a new prospectus is not required; instead, the sponsor must submit a written request for an instrument modification accompanied by appropriate documentation. The district engineer must notify the sponsor within 30 days whether or not a submitted prospectus is complete. A complete prospectus includes the following information:

    (i) The objectives of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.

    (ii) How the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program will be established and operated.

    (iii) The proposed service area.

    (iv) The general need for and technical feasibility of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.

    (v) The proposed ownership arrangements and long-term management strategy for the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project sites.

    (vi) The qualifications of the sponsor to successfully complete the type(s) of mitigation project(s) proposed, including information describing any past such activities by the sponsor.

    (vii) For a proposed mitigation bank, the prospectus must also address:

    (A) The ecological suitability of the site to achieve the objectives of the proposed mitigation bank, including the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the bank site and how that site will support the planned types of aquatic resources and functions; and

    (B) Assurance of sufficient water rights to support the long-term sustainability of the mitigation bank.

    (viii) For a proposed in-lieu fee program, the prospectus must also include:

    (A) The compensation planning framework (see paragraph (c) of this section); and

    (B) A description of the in-lieu fee program account required by paragraph (i) of this section.

    (3)  Prior to submitting a prospectus, the sponsor may elect to submit a draft prospectus to the district engineer for comment and consultation. The district engineer will provide copies of the draft prospectus to the IRT and will provide comments back to the sponsor within 30 days. Any comments from IRT members will also be forwarded to the sponsor. This preliminary review is optional but is strongly recommended. It is intended to identify potential issues early so that the sponsor may attempt to address those issues prior to the start of the formal review process.

    (4)  Within 30 days of receipt of a complete prospectus or an instrument modification request that will be processed in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the district engineer will provide public notice of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, in accordance with the public notice procedures at 33 CFR 325.3. The public notice must, at a minimum, include a summary of the prospectus and indicate that the full prospectus is available to the public for review upon request. For modifications of approved instruments, the public notice must instead summarize, and make available to the public upon request, whatever documentation is appropriate for the modification (e.g., a new or revised mitigation plan). The comment period for public notice will be 30 days, unless the district engineer determines that a longer comment period is appropriate. The district engineer will notify the sponsor if the comment period is extended beyond 30 days, including an explanation of why the longer comment period is necessary. Copies of all comments received in response to the public notice must be distributed to the other IRT members and to the sponsor within 15 days of the close of the public comment period. The district engineer and IRT members may also provide comments to the sponsor at this time, and copies of any such comments will also be distributed to all IRT members. If the construction of a mitigation bank or an in-lieu fee program project requires a DA permit, the public notice requirement may be satisfied through the public notice provisions of the permit processing procedures, provided all of the relevant information is provided.

    (5)  (i) After the end of the comment period, the district engineer will review the comments received in response to the public notice, and make a written initial evaluation as to the potential of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program to provide compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by DA permits. This initial evaluation letter must be provided to the sponsor within 30 days of the end of the public notice comment period.

    (ii) If the district engineer determines that the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program has potential for providing appropriate compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by DA permits, the initial evaluation letter will inform the sponsor that he/she may proceed with preparation of the draft instrument (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).

    (iii) If the district engineer determines that the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program does not have potential for providing appropriate compensatory mitigation for DA permits, the initial evaluation letter must discuss the reasons for that determination. The sponsor may revise the prospectus to address the district engineer's concerns, and submit the revised prospectus to the district engineer. If the sponsor submits a revised prospectus, a revised public notice will be issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

    (iv) This initial evaluation procedure does not apply to proposed modifications of approved instruments.

    (6)  (i) After considering comments from the district engineer, the IRT, and the public, if the sponsor chooses to proceed with establishment of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, he must prepare a draft instrument and submit it to the district engineer. In the case of an instrument modification, the sponsor must prepare a draft amendment (e.g., a specific instrument provision, a new or modified mitigation plan), and submit it to the district engineer. The district engineer must notify the sponsor within 30 days of receipt, whether the draft instrument or amendment is complete. If the draft instrument or amendment is incomplete, the district engineer will request from the sponsor the information necessary to make the draft instrument or amendment complete. Once any additional information is submitted, the district engineer must notify the sponsor as soon as he determines that the draft instrument or amendment is complete. The draft instrument must be based on the prospectus and must describe in detail the physical and legal characteristics of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program and how it will be established and operated.

    (ii) For mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs, the draft instrument must include the following information:

    (A) A description of the proposed geographic service area of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program. The service area is the watershed, ecoregion, physiographic province, and/or other geographic area within which the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is authorized to provide compensatory mitigation required by DA permits. The service area must be appropriately sized to ensure that the aquatic resources provided will effectively compensate for adverse environmental impacts across the entire service area. For example, in urban areas, a U.S. Geological Survey 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watershed or a smaller watershed may be an appropriate service area. In rural areas, several contiguous 8-digit HUCs or a 6-digit HUC watershed may be an appropriate service area. Delineation of the service area must also consider any locally-developed standards and criteria that may be applicable. The economic viability of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program may also be considered in determining the size of the service area. The basis for the proposed service area must be documented in the instrument. An in-lieu fee program or umbrella mitigation banking instrument may have multiple service areas governed by its instrument (e.g., each watershed within a state or Corps district may be a separate service area under the instrument); however, all impacts and compensatory mitigation must be accounted for by service area;

    (B) Accounting procedures;

    (C) A provision stating that legal responsibility for providing the compensatory mitigation lies with the sponsor once a permittee secures credits from the sponsor;

    (D) Default and closure provisions;

    (E) Reporting protocols; and

    (F) Any other information deemed necessary by the district engineer.

    (iii) For a mitigation bank, a complete draft instrument must include the following additional information:

    (A) Mitigation plans that include all applicable items listed in § 332.4(c)(2) through (14); and

    (B) A credit release schedule, which is tied to achievement of specific milestones. All credit releases must be approved by the district engineer, in consultation with the IRT, based on a determination that required milestones have been achieved. The district engineer, in consultation with the IRT, may modify the credit release schedule, including reducing the number of available credits or suspending credit sales or transfers altogether, where necessary to ensure that all credit sales or transfers remain tied to compensatory mitigation projects with a high likelihood of meeting performance standards;

    (iv) For an in-lieu fee program, a complete draft instrument must include the following additional information:

    (A) The compensation planning framework (see paragraph (c) of this section);

    (B) Specification of the initial allocation of advance credits (see paragraph (n) of this section) and a draft fee schedule for these credits, by service area, including an explanation of the basis for the allocation and draft fee schedule;

    (C) A methodology for determining future project-specific credits and fees; and

    (D) A description of the in-lieu fee program account required by paragraph (i) of this section.

    (7)  Upon receipt of notification by the district engineer that the draft instrument or amendment is complete, the sponsor must provide the district engineer with a sufficient number of copies of the draft instrument or amendment to distribute to the IRT members. The district engineer will promptly distribute copies of the draft instrument or amendment to the IRT members for a 30-day comment period. The 30-day comment period begins 5 days after the district engineer distributes the copies of the draft instrument or amendment to the IRT. Following the comment period, the district engineer will discuss any comments with the appropriate agencies and with the sponsor. The district engineer will seek to resolve issues using a consensus based approach, to the extent practicable, while still meeting the decision-making time frames specified in this section. Within 90 days of receipt of the complete draft instrument or amendment by the IRT members, the district engineer must notify the sponsor of the status of the _IRT review._ Specifically, the district engineer must indicate to the sponsor if the draft instrument or amendment is generally acceptable and what changes, if any, are needed. If there are significant unresolved concerns that may lead to a formal objection from one or more IRT members to the final instrument or amendment, the district engineer will indicate the nature of those concerns.

    (8)  The sponsor must submit a final instrument to the district engineer for approval, with supporting documentation that explains how the final instrument addresses the comments provided by the IRT. For modifications of approved instruments, the sponsor must submit a final amendment to the district engineer for approval, with supporting documentation that explains how the final amendment addresses the comments provided by the IRT. The final instrument or amendment must be provided directly by the sponsor to all members of the IRT. Within 30 days of receipt of the final instrument or amendment, the district engineer will notify the IRT members whether or not he intends to approve the instrument or amendment. If no IRT member objects, by initiating the dispute resolution process in paragraph (e) of this section within 45 days of receipt of the final instrument or amendment, the district engineer will notify the sponsor of his final decision and, if the instrument or amendment is approved, arrange for it to be signed by the appropriate parties. If any IRT member initiates the dispute resolution process, the district engineer will notify the sponsor. Following conclusion of the dispute resolution process, the district engineer will notify the sponsor of his final decision, and if the instrument or amendment is approved, arrange for it to be signed by the appropriate parties. For mitigation banks, the final instrument must contain the information items listed in paragraphs (d)(6)(ii), and (iii) of this section. For in-lieu fee programs, the final instrument must contain the information items listed in paragraphs (d)(6)(ii) and (iv) of this section. For the modification of an approved instrument, the amendment must contain appropriate information, as determined by the district engineer. The final instrument or amendment must be made available to the public upon request.

    (e)  (1) Within 15 days of receipt of the district engineer's notification of intent to approve an instrument or amendment, the Regional Administrator of the U.S. EPA, the Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Regional Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service, and/or other senior officials of agencies represented on the IRT may notify the district engineer and other IRT members by letter if they object to the approval of the proposed final instrument or amendment. This letter must include an explanation of the basis for the objection and, where feasible, offer recommendations for resolving the objections. If the district engineer does not receive any objections within this time period, he may proceed to final action on the instrument or amendment.

    (2) The district engineer must respond to the objection within 30 days of receipt of the letter. The district engineer's response may indicate an intent to disapprove the instrument or amendment as a result of the objection, an intent to approve the instrument or amendment despite the objection, or may provide a modified instrument or amendment that attempts to address the objection. The district engineer's response must be provided to all IRT members.

    (3) Within 15 days of receipt of the district engineer's response, if the Regional Administrator or Regional Director is not satisfied with the response he may forward the issue to the Assistant Administrator for Water of the U.S. EPA, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks of the U.S. FWS, or the Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of NOAA, as appropriate, for review and must notify the district engineer by letter via electronic mail or facsimile machine (with copies to all IRT members) that the issue has been forwarded for Headquarters review. This step is available only to the IRT members representing these three federal agencies, however other IRT members who do not agree with the district engineer's final decision do not have to sign the instrument or amendment or recognize the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program for purposes of their own programs and authorities. If an IRT member other than the one filing the original objection has a new objection based on the district engineer's response, he may use the first step in this procedure (paragraph (e)(1) of this section) to provide that objection to the district engineer.

    (4) If the issue has not been forwarded to the objecting agency's Headquarters, then the district engineer may proceed with final action on the instrument or amendment. If the issue has been forwarded to the objecting agency's Headquarters, the district engineer must hold in abeyance the final action on the instrument or amendment, pending Headquarters level review described below.

    (5) Within 20 days from the date of the letter requesting Headquarters level review, the Assistant Administrator for Water, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, or the Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere must either notify the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) (ASA(CW)) that further review will not be requested, or request that the ASA(CW) review the final instrument or amendment.

    (6) Within 30 days of receipt of the letter from the objecting agency's Headquarters request for ASA(CW)'s review of the final instrument, the ASA(CW), through the Director of Civil Works, must review the draft instrument or amendment and advise the district engineer on how to proceed with final action on that instrument or amendment. The ASA(CW) must immediately notify the Assistant Administrator for Water, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, and/or the Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the final decision.

    (7) In cases where the dispute resolution procedure is used, the district engineer must notify the sponsor of his final decision within 150 days of receipt of the final instrument or amendment.

    (f)  (1) The deadlines in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section may be extended by the district engineer at his sole discretion in cases where:

    (i) Compliance with other applicable laws, such as consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act or section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, is required;

    (ii) It is necessary to conduct government-to-government consultation with Indian tribes;

    (iii) Timely submittal of information necessary for the review of the proposed mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program or the proposed modification of an approved instrument is not accomplished by the sponsor; or

    (iv) Information that is essential to the district engineer's decision cannot be reasonably obtained within the specified time frame.

    (2) In such cases, the district engineer must promptly notify the sponsor in writing of the extension and the reason for it. Such extensions shall be for the minimum time necessary to resolve the issue necessitating the extension.

    (g) —(1)  Modification of an approved instrument, including the addition and approval of umbrella mitigation bank sites or in-lieu fee project sites or expansions of previously approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project sites, must follow the appropriate procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the district engineer determines that the streamlined review process described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is warranted.

    (2)  The streamlined modification review process may be used for the following modifications of instruments: changes reflecting adaptive management of the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, credit releases, changes in credit releases and credit release schedules, and changes that the district engineer determines are not significant. If the district engineer determines that the streamlined review process is warranted, he must notify the IRT members and the sponsor of this determination and provide them with copies of the proposed modification. IRT members and the sponsor have 30 days to notify the district engineer if they have concerns with the proposed modification. If IRT members or the sponsor notify the district engineer of such concerns, the district engineer shall attempt to resolve those concerns. Within 60 days of providing the proposed modification to the IRT, the district engineer must notify the IRT members of his intent to approve or disapprove the proposed modification. If no IRT member objects, by initiating the dispute resolution process in paragraph (e) of this section, within 15 days of receipt of this notification, the district engineer will notify the sponsor of his final decision and, if the modification is approved, arrange for it to be signed by the appropriate parties. If any IRT member initiates the dispute resolution process, the district engineer will so notify the sponsor. Following conclusion of the dispute resolution process, the district engineer will notify the sponsor of his final decision, and if the modification is approved, arrange for it to be signed by the appropriate parties.

    (h)  A single mitigation banking instrument may provide for future authorization of additional mitigation bank sites. As additional sites are selected, they must be included in the mitigation banking instrument as modifications, using the procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Credit withdrawal from the additional bank sites shall be consistent with paragraph (m) of this section.

    (i)  (1) The in-lieu fee program sponsor must establish a program account after the instrument is approved by the district engineer, prior to accepting any fees from permittees. If the sponsor accepts funds from entities other than permittees, those funds must be kept in separate accounts. The program account must be established at a financial institution that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. All interests and earnings accruing to the program account must remain in that account for use by the in-lieu fee program for the purposes of providing compensatory mitigation for DA permits. The program account may only be used for the selection, design, acquisition, implementation, and management of in-lieu fee compensatory mitigation projects, except for a small percentage (as determined by the district engineer in consultation with the IRT and specified in the instrument) that can be used for administrative costs.

    (2) The sponsor must submit proposed in-lieu fee projects to the district engineer for funding approval. Disbursements from the program account may only be made upon receipt of written authorization from the district engineer, after the district engineer has consulted with the IRT. The terms of the program account must specify that the district engineer has the authority to direct those funds to alternative compensatory mitigation projects in cases where the sponsor does not provide compensatory mitigation in accordance with the time frame specified in paragraph (n)(4) of this section.

    (3) The sponsor must provide annual reports to the district engineer and the IRT. The annual reports must include the following information:

    (i) All income received, disbursements, and interest earned by the program account;

    (ii) A list of all permits for which in-lieu fee program funds were accepted. This list shall include: The Corps permit number (or the state permit number if there is no corresponding Corps permit number, in cases of state programmatic general permits or other regional general permits), the service area in which the authorized impacts are located, the amount of authorized impacts, the amount of required compensatory mitigation, the amount paid to the in-lieu fee program, and the date the funds were received from the permittee;

    (iii) A description of in-lieu fee program expenditures from the account, such as the costs of land acquisition, planning, construction, monitoring, maintenance, contingencies, adaptive management, and administration;

    (iv) The balance of advance credits and released credits at the end of the report period for each service area; and

    (v) Any other information required by the district engineer.

    (4) The district engineer may audit the records pertaining to the program account. All books, accounts, reports, files, and other records relating to the in-lieu fee program account shall be available at reasonable times for inspection and audit by the district engineer.

    (j)  (1) As in-lieu fee project sites are identified and secured, the sponsor must submit mitigation plans to the district engineer that include all applicable items listed in § 332.4(c)(2) through (14). The mitigation plan must also include a credit release schedule consistent with paragraph (o)(8) of this section that is tied to achievement of specific performance standards. The review and approval of in-lieu fee projects will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, as modifications of the in-lieu fee program instrument. This includes compensatory mitigation projects conducted by another party on behalf of the sponsor through requests for proposals and awarding of contracts.

    (2) If a DA permit is required for an in-lieu fee project, the permit should not be issued until all relevant provisions of the mitigation plan have been substantively determined, to ensure that the DA permit accurately reflects all relevant provisions of the approved mitigation plan, such as performance standards.

    (k)  In cases where initial establishment of the mitigation bank, or the development of a new project site under an umbrella banking instrument, involves activities requiring DA authorization, the permit should not be issued until all relevant provisions of the mitigation plan have been substantively determined. This is to ensure that the DA permit accurately reflects all relevant provisions of the final instrument, such as performance standards.

    (l)  (1) The sponsor must have an approved instrument prior to collecting funds from permittees to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits.

    (2) Authorization to sell credits to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements in DA permits is contingent on compliance with all of the terms of the instrument. This includes constructing a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project in accordance with the mitigation plan approved by the district engineer and incorporated by reference in the instrument. If the aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activities cannot be implemented in accordance with the approved mitigation plan, the district engineer must consult with the sponsor and the IRT to consider modifications to the instrument, including adaptive management, revisions to the credit release schedule, and alternatives for providing compensatory mitigation to satisfy any credits that have already been sold.

    (3) An in-lieu fee program sponsor is responsible for the implementation, long-term management, and any required remediation of the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activities, even though those activities may be conducted by other parties through requests for proposals or other contracting mechanisms.

    (m)  The mitigation banking instrument may allow for an initial debiting of a percentage of the total credits projected at mitigation bank maturity, provided the following conditions are satisfied: the mitigation banking instrument and mitigation plan have been approved, the mitigation bank site has been secured, appropriate financial assurances have been established, and any other requirements determined to be necessary by the district engineer have been fulfilled. The mitigation banking instrument must provide a schedule for additional credit releases as appropriate milestones are achieved (see paragraph (o)(8) of this section). Implementation of the approved mitigation plan shall be initiated no later than the first full growing season after the date of the first credit transaction.

    (n)  (1) The in-lieu fee program instrument may make a limited number of advance credits available to permittees when the instrument is approved. The number of advance credits will be determined by the district engineer, in consultation with the IRT, and will be specified for each service area in the instrument. The number of advance credits will be based on the following considerations:

    (i) The compensation planning framework;

    (ii) The sponsor's past performance for implementing aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activities in the proposed service area or other areas; and

    (iii) The projected financing necessary to begin planning and implementation of in-lieu fee projects.

    (2) To determine the appropriate number of advance credits for a particular service area, the district engineer may require the sponsor to provide confidential supporting information that will not be made available to the general public. Examples of confidential supporting information may include prospective in-lieu fee project sites.

    (3) As released credits are produced by in-lieu fee projects, they must be used to fulfill any advance credits that have already been provided within the project service area before any remaining released credits can be sold or transferred to permittees. Once previously provided advance credits have been fulfilled, an equal number of advance credits is re-allocated to the sponsor for sale or transfer to fulfill new mitigation requirements, consistent with the terms of the instrument. The number of advance credits available to the sponsor at any given time to sell or transfer to permittees in a given service area is equal to the number of advance credits specified in the instrument, minus any that have already been provided but not yet fulfilled.

    (4) Land acquisition and initial physical and biological improvements must be completed by the third full growing season after the first advance credit in that service area is secured by a permittee, unless the district engineer determines that more or less time is needed to plan and implement an in-lieu fee project. If the district engineer determines that there is a compensatory mitigation deficit in a specific service area by the third growing season after the first advance credit in that service area is sold, and determines that it would not be in the public interest to allow the sponsor additional time to plan and implement an in-lieu fee project, the district engineer must direct the sponsor to disburse funds from the in-lieu fee program account to provide alternative compensatory mitigation to fulfill those compensation obligations.

    (5) The sponsor is responsible for complying with the terms of the in-lieu fee program instrument. If the district engineer determines, as a result of review of annual reports on the operation of the in-lieu fee program (see paragraphs (p)(2) and (q)(1) of this section), that it is not performing in compliance with its instrument, the district engineer will take appropriate action, which may include suspension of credit sales, to ensure compliance with the in-lieu fee program instrument (see paragraph (o)(10) of this section). Permittees that secured credits from the in-lieu fee program are not responsible for in-lieu fee program compliance.

    (o)  (1)  The principal units for credits and debits are acres, linear feet, functional assessment units, or other suitable metrics of particular resource types. Functional assessment units or other suitable metrics may be linked to acres or linear feet.

    (2)  Where practicable, an appropriate assessment method (e.g., hydrogeomorphic approach to wetlands functional assessment, index of biological integrity) or other suitable metric must be used to assess and describe the aquatic resource types that will be restored, established, enhanced and/or preserved by the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project.

    (3)  The number of credits must reflect the difference between pre- and post-compensatory mitigation project site conditions, as determined by a functional or condition assessment or other suitable metric.

    (4)  Once a credit is debited (sold or transferred to a permittee), its value cannot change.

    (5)  (i) The cost of compensatory mitigation credits provided by a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is determined by the sponsor.

    (ii) For in-lieu fee programs, the cost per unit of credit must include the expected costs associated with the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation of aquatic resources in that service area. These costs must be based on full cost accounting, and include, as appropriate, expenses such as land acquisition, project planning and design, construction, plant materials, labor, legal fees, monitoring, and remediation or adaptive management activities, as well as administration of the in-lieu fee program. The cost per unit credit must also take into account contingency costs appropriate to the stage of project planning, including uncertainties in construction and real estate expenses. The cost per unit of credit must also take into account the resources necessary for the long-term management and protection of the in-lieu fee project. In addition, the cost per unit credit must include financial assurances that are necessary to ensure successful completion of in-lieu fee projects.

    (6)  These credits should be specified as acres, linear feet, or other suitable metrics of preservation of a particular resource type. In determining the compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits using mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs, the district engineer should apply a higher mitigation ratio if the requirements are to be met through the use of preservation credits. In determining this higher ratio, the district engineer must consider the relative importance of both the impacted and the preserved aquatic resources in sustaining watershed functions.

    (7)  These credits should be specified as acres, linear feet, or other suitable metrics of riparian area, buffer, and uplands, respectively. Non-aquatic resources can only be used as compensatory mitigation for impacts to aquatic resources authorized by DA permits when those resources are essential to maintaining the ecological viability of adjoining aquatic resources. In determining the compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits using mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs, the district engineer may authorize the use of riparian area, buffer, and/or upland credits if he determines that these areas are essential to sustaining aquatic resource functions in the watershed and are the most appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts.

    (8)  (i)  Release of credits must be tied to performance-based milestones (e.g., construction, planting, establishment of specified plant and animal communities). The credit release schedule should reserve a significant share of the total credits for release only after full achievement of ecological performance standards. When determining the credit release schedule, factors to be considered may include, but are not limited to: The method of providing compensatory mitigation credits (e.g., restoration), the likelihood of success, the nature and amount of work needed to generate the credits, and the aquatic resource type(s) and function(s) to be provided by the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee project. The district engineer will determine the credit release schedule, including the share to be released only after full achievement of performance standards, after consulting with the IRT. Once released, credits may only be used to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements of a DA permit if the use of credits for a specific permit has been approved by the district engineer.

    (ii) For single-site mitigation banks, the terms of the credit release schedule must be specified in the mitigation banking instrument. The credit release schedule may provide for an initial debiting of a limited number of credits once the instrument is approved and other appropriate milestones are achieved (see paragraph (m) of this section).

    (iii) For in-lieu fee projects and umbrella mitigation bank sites, the terms of the credit release schedule must be specified in the approved mitigation plan. When an in-lieu fee project or umbrella mitigation bank site is implemented and is achieving the performance-based milestones specified in the credit release schedule, credits are generated in accordance with the credit release schedule for the approved mitigation plan. If the in-lieu fee project or umbrella mitigation bank site does not achieve those performance-based milestones, the district engineer may modify the credit release schedule, including reducing the number of credits.

    (9)  Credit releases for mitigation banks and in-lieu fee projects must be approved by the district engineer. In order for credits to be released, the sponsor must submit documentation to the district engineer demonstrating that the appropriate milestones for credit release have been achieved and requesting the release. The district engineer will provide copies of this documentation to the IRT members for review. IRT members must provide any comments to the district engineer within 15 days of receiving this documentation. However, if the district engineer determines that a site visit is necessary, IRT members must provide any comments to the district engineer within 15 days of the site visit. The district engineer must schedule the site visit so that it occurs as soon as it is practicable, but the site visit may be delayed by seasonal considerations that affect the ability of the district engineer and the IRT to assess whether the applicable credit release milestones have been achieved. After full consideration of any comments received, the district engineer will determine whether the milestones have been achieved and the credits can be released. The district engineer shall make a decision within 30 days of the end of that comment period, and notify the sponsor and the IRT.

    (10)  If the district engineer determines that the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program is not meeting performance standards or complying with the terms of the instrument, appropriate action will be taken. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, suspending credit sales, adaptive management, decreasing available credits, utilizing financial assurances, and terminating the instrument.

    (p)  (1) For mitigation banks, the instrument must contain a provision requiring the sponsor to establish and maintain a ledger to account for all credit transactions. Each time an approved credit transaction occurs, the sponsor must notify the district engineer.

    (2) For in-lieu fee programs, the instrument must contain a provision requiring the sponsor to establish and maintain an annual report ledger in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this section, as well as individual ledgers that track the production of released credits for each in-lieu fee project.

    (q)  (1)  The sponsor must compile an annual ledger report showing the beginning and ending balance of available credits and permitted impacts for each resource type, all additions and subtractions of credits, and any other changes in credit availability (e.g., additional credits released, credit sales suspended). The ledger report must be submitted to the district engineer, who will distribute copies to the IRT members. The ledger report is part of the administrative record for the mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program. The district engineer will make the ledger report available to the public upon request.

    (2)  The sponsor is responsible for monitoring the mitigation bank site or the in-lieu fee project site in accordance with the approved monitoring requirements to determine the level of success and identify problems requiring remedial action or adaptive management measures. Monitoring must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in § 332.6, and at time intervals appropriate for the particular project type and until such time that the district engineer, in consultation with the IRT, has determined that the performance standards have been attained. The instrument must include requirements for periodic monitoring reports to be submitted to the district engineer, who will provide copies to other IRT members.

    (3)  The district engineer may require the sponsor to provide an annual report showing beginning and ending balances, including deposits into and any withdrawals from, the accounts providing funds for financial assurances and long-term management activities. The report should also include information on the amount of required financial assurances and the status of those assurances, including their potential expiration.

    (r)  Except as provided below, all activities authorized by DA permits are eligible, at the discretion of the district engineer, to use mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs to fulfill compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits. The district engineer will determine the number and type(s) of credits required to compensate for the authorized impacts. Permit applicants may propose to use a particular mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program to provide the required compensatory mitigation. In such cases, the sponsor must provide the permit applicant with a statement of credit availability. The district engineer must review the permit applicant's compensatory mitigation proposal, and notify the applicant of his determination regarding the acceptability of using that mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.

    (s)  If, in the view of a member of the IRT, an issued permit or series of issued permits raises concerns about how credits from a particular mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program are being used to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements (including concerns about whether credit use is consistent with the terms of the instrument), the IRT member may notify the district engineer in writing of the concern. The district engineer shall promptly consult with the IRT to address the concern. Resolution of the concern is at the discretion of the district engineer, consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and policies regarding compensatory mitigation requirements for DA permits. Nothing in this section limits the authorities designated to IRT agencies under existing statutes or regulations.

    (t)  (1) For mitigation bank sites, real estate instruments, management plans, or other long-term mechanisms used for site protection must be finalized before any credits can be released.

    (2) For in-lieu fee project sites, real estate instruments, management plans, or other long-term protection mechanisms used for site protection must be finalized before advance credits can become released credits.

    (u)  (1) The legal mechanisms and the party responsible for the long-term management and the protection of the mitigation bank site must be documented in the instrument or, in the case of umbrella mitigation banking instruments and in-lieu fee programs, the approved mitigation plans. The responsible party should make adequate provisions for the operation, maintenance, and long-term management of the compensatory mitigation project site. The long-term management plan should include a description of long-term management needs and identify the funding mechanism that will be used to meet those needs.

    (2) The instrument may contain provisions for the sponsor to transfer long-term management responsibilities to a land stewardship entity, such as a public agency, non-governmental organization, or private land manager.

    (3) The instrument or approved mitigation plan must address the financial arrangements and timing of any necessary transfer of long-term management funds to the steward.

    (4) Where needed, the acquisition and protection of water rights should be secured and documented in the instrument or, in the case of umbrella mitigation banking instruments and in-lieu fee programs, the approved mitigation site plan.

    (v) —(1)  All mitigation banking instruments approved on or after July 9, 2008 must meet the requirements of this part. Mitigation banks approved prior to July 9, 2008 may continue to operate under the terms of their existing instruments. However, any modification to such a mitigation banking instrument on or after July 9, 2008, including authorization of additional sites under an umbrella mitigation banking instrument, expansion of an existing site, or addition of a different type of resource credits (e.g., stream credits to a wetland bank) must be consistent with the terms of this part.

    (2)  All in-lieu fee program instruments approved on or after July 9, 2008 must meet the requirements of this part. In-lieu fee programs operating under instruments approved prior to July 9, 2008 may continue to operate under those instruments for two years after the effective date of this rule, after which time they must meet the requirements of this part, unless the district engineer determines that circumstances warrant an extension of up to three additional years. The district engineer must consult with the IRT before approving such extensions. Any revisions made to the in-lieu fee program instrument on or after July 9, 2008 must be consistent with the terms of this part. Any approved project for which construction was completed under the terms of a previously approved instrument may continue to operate indefinitely under those terms if the district engineer determines that the project is providing appropriate mitigation substantially consistent with the terms of this part.

The appropriate signals shall be displayed 30 minutes prior to rocket-launching time and shall remain displayed until the danger no longer exists.

    (4) In addition to visual signals and prior to conducting launch operations, the area will be patrolled by aircraft or surface vessels and monitored by radars and cameras to ensure no persons or watercraft are within the danger zone or designated area of interest within the danger zone. Patrol aircraft and surface vessels are equipped with marine band radios and may attempt to hail watercraft and request that they leave the designated area and remain clear of the area at a safe distance until launch operations are complete, and launch will not occur until the designated area is clear. Patrol aircraft may also employ the method of warning known as “buzzing” which consists of low flight by the airplane and repeated opening and closing of the throttle. Surveillance vessels may also come close to watercraft and employ flashing light to establish communications to indicate that the watercraft is entering the designated hazard area.

    (5) Any watercraft being so warned shall immediately leave the designated area until the conclusion of launch operations, and shall remain at a distance to ensure that it will be safe from falling debris.

    (6) Nothing in this regulation shall be intended to prevent commercial fishing or the lawful use of approved waterfowl hunting blinds along the shorelines of the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, provided that all necessary licenses and permits have been obtained from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Commercial fishermen and waterfowl hunters must observe all warnings and range clearances during hazardous range operations.

    (f)  (1) Fishermen and crabbers desiring to set fixed nets within the restricted waters of Aberdeen Proving Ground Reservation are required in every instance to have a written permit. A fixed net for the purpose of this paragraph is defined as a pound net, staked gill net, hedge fike net, hoop net, eel pot, crab pot, and all other types of nets fastened by means of poles, stakes, weights, or anchors. Permits to fish and crab within the restricted waters of Aberdeen Proving Ground may be obtained by written application to the Commanding Officer, Department of the Army, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Attention: Provost Marshall Division, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. Applicants for permits must state the location at which they desire to set fixed nets and state the period of time for which they desire the permit to cover. Nets placed in the restricted waters are subject to damage by gunfire and bombing, and the risk of such damage will be assumed by the holder of the permit.

    (2) Holders of permits for setting fixed nets must comply with the provisions of this part and also with § 206.50(d) of this chapter.

    (g)  Fishermen and crabbers who have been granted permits to fish or crab within the restricted waters of Aberdeen Proving Ground Reservation with fixed nets must at each location have a stake securely driven at the outer end of the line of nets on which is mounted a sign board which contains their name and permit number. All stakes set within the restricted area established by this regulation will project at least three (3) feet above the surface of the water at all ordinary high stages of the tide. Nets and other fishing and crabbing structures erected will be marked by stakes set at intervals not greater than fifty (50) feet. Fishing and crabbing structures erected in Aberdeen Proving Ground waters will be plainly marked on both ends, and will be lighted with a white light between sunset and sunrise, by and at the expense of the owner.

    (h)  At the end of the fishing and crabbing season, fishermen and crabbers must remove and haul away from the location all pound nets, pots, poles or stakes used in their operation. Pound net poles or stakes must not be cast adrift after removal.

    (i)  It must be distinctly understood that holders of permits to fish or crab are not authorized to enter the restricted waters of Aberdeen Proving Ground Reservation outside the hours as announced by the Commanding Officer, Aberdeen Proving Ground. In addition, the privileges granted in this paragraph include no right to land nor to cut or procure pound net poles or stakes on the Aberdeen Proving Ground Reservation.

    (j) Aberdeen Proving Ground Regulations (APGR) 210-10 will govern commercial fishing and crabbing and APGR 210-26 will govern recreational (non-commercial) fishing and crabbing. This section shall be enforced by the Commander, Aberdeen Proving Ground, and such agencies as he/she may designate.

    (k)  The taking of fish and crabs in the waters of Aberdeen Proving Ground Reservation and the setting of and location of nets, in a manner not in compliance with Federal, State, and county laws is prohibited.

All vessels transiting inbound/outbound of the channel except for those vessels listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall proceed at speeds commensurate with minimum wake. Any vessel equipped with a marine radio can monitor VHF-FM channel 12 for message traffic from Little Creek Port Control.

    (ii) When Commanding Officer, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story is ordered to implement Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) Charlie/Delta, or when specific authority is granted by the District Engineer, all vessel traffic movement can be restricted except for those vessels that meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. FPCONs are a system of protective measures used by the Department of Defense (DOD) installations to guard against and deter terrorist attack. Senior commanders assign the FPCONs for their region, and installation commanders may raise FPCONS and tighten security measures based on local conditions. In the event FPCONs Charlie/Delta is implemented by the Commanding Officer, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek, which requires the restriction of vessel traffic movement in the Outer Harbor Restricted Area, the installation will coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard, Fifth District; Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District; and state and local law enforcement and governmental authorities. The installation will also disseminate information to the public and local news media outlets. Information on whether vessel traffic movement has been restricted in the Outer Harbor Restricted Area due to the implementation of FPCONs Charlie/Delta will also be published and disseminated by the U.S. Coast Guard.

    (2)  All vessels or persons intending to transit inbound/outbound of the Inner Harbor Restricted Area shall request permission from Little Creek Harbor Port Control using VHF-FM channel 12 prior to transiting and will provide their destination/intentions with the exception of those vessels that meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The Inner Harbor Restricted Area is limited to those privately owned vessels or persons calling upon the commercial/private piers located within the Inner Harbor and government owned vessels (public vessels) transiting to and from U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard facilities and authorized DOD patrons of the U.S. Navy recreational marina. No other vessels or persons may enter or exit this area unless specific authorization is granted by Commanding Officer, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, and/or other persons or agencies as he/she may designate.

    (3) All vessels or persons transiting inbound/outbound of the Inner Harbor Restricted Area are subject to all applicable federal and state laws including laws or regulations designed to protect the naval facility and persons or vessels assigned therein. Federal and state law enforcement officials may at any time take action to ensure compliance with their respective laws. In addition, this regulation authorizes Navy security personnel, designated by Commander, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story or persons authorized to act in his/her behalf, the authority to ascertain the identity and intent of any vessels and/or persons transiting the restricted area that indicate by way of appearance or action they are a possible threat to government assets. If a determination is made that the vessel and/or persons are a threat to government assets located within the restricted area, Navy security units may take actions as provided by law or regulation that are deemed necessary to protect government personnel and assets located within the restricted area.

    (c)  (1) The regulation in this section shall be enforced by the Commanding Officer, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, U.S. Coast Guard, local/state law enforcement, and/or persons or agencies as he/she may designate during emergency situations.

    (2) Federal and state law enforcement vessels and personnel may enter anywhere in the restricted area at any time in the operation of their statutory missions or to enforce their respective laws.

    (3) Nothing in this regulation is deemed to preempt 33 CFR 165.501.

    (4) Vessels or persons calling upon the commercial/private piers located within the Inner Harbor with proper identification and clearance will be allowed entry subject to the same provisions described in paragraph (b) of this section. Commanding Officer, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story reserves the right to temporarily deny entry in emergency situations, elevated DOD Force Protection conditions in the Harbor, or other safety of navigation constraints.

#### § § 334.440

    (a)  The waters of the Atlantic Ocean within a sector bounded on the north by a line bearing 105° from latitude 34°37′25″, longitude 77°10′35″; on the east and south by the arc of a circle having a radius of 25,000 yards centered at latitude 34°34′15″, longitude 77°16′10″; on the west by a line bearing 205° from latitude 34°32′37″, longitude 77°18′34″, and on the northwest by the shore.

    (b)  The firing ranges include all waters to the high waterline within eight sections described as follows:

    (1)  Bounded on the south by a line running from Cedar Point 280° to New River Light 70, thence 254° to Hatch Point; and on the northwest by a line running from Wilkins Bluff 232° to Hall Point.

    (2)  Bounded on the southeast by the northwest boundary of the Traps Bay Sector and on the west by Sneads Ferry Bridge.

    (3)  Bounded on the east by Sneads Ferry Bridge and on the north by a line running from a point on the east side of New River opposite the head of Sneads Creek 291°30′ to the south side of the mouth of Stone Creek.

    (4)  The northwest portion of Stone Bay, bounded on the south by the north boundary of the Stone Bay Sector; and on the east by longitude 77°26′.

    (5)  Bounded on the south by the north boundary of the Stone Bay Sector; on the west by the east boundary of the Stone Creek Sector; and on the northeast by a line running from Town Point 113° to the south side of the mouth of French Creek.

    (6)  Bounded on the south by the northeast boundary of the Grey Point Sector, including French Creek up to longitude 77°20′; and on the north by a line running from Hadnot Point 285°30′ to Holmes Point.

    (7)  Bounded on the south by the north boundary of the Farnell Bay Sector, including Wallace Creek up to longitude 77°22′; and on the northwest by a line running from Paradise Point 243°30′ to Ragged Point.

    (c)  (1) No person shall enter or remain in the water in any closed section after notice of firing therein has been given. Sailing vessels and any watercraft having a speed of less than 5 knots shall keep clear of any closed sector at all times after notice of firing therein has been given. Vessels propelled by mechanical power at a speed greater than 5 knots may enter the sectors without restriction except when the firing signals are being displayed. When these signals are displayed, vessels shall clear the closed sectors immediately and no vessels shall enter such sectors until the signals indicate that firing has ceased.

    (2) Firing will take place both day and night at irregular periods throughout the year. Insofar as training requirements will permit, underwater explosions will be restricted in the Atlantic Ocean sector (described in paragraph (a) of this section) during the periods May 1 and June 5, inclusive, and November 22 to December 15, inclusive.

    (3) Two days in advance of the day when firing in any sector except the Stone Creek sector is scheduled to begin, the enforcing agency will warn the public of the contemplated firing, stating the sector or sectors to be closed, through the public press and the U.S. Coast Guard and, in the case of the Atlantic Ocean sector, the Cape Fear Pilots Association at Southport, and the Pilots Association at Moorehead City, North Carolina. The Stone Creek sector may be closed without advance notice.

    (4) Towers at least 50 feet in height will be erected near the shore at the northeast and southwest limits of the Atlantic Ocean sector, and towers at least 25 feet in height will be erected near the easterly shore at the upper and lower limits of each New River sector. On days when firing is to take place a red flag will be displayed on each of the towers marking the sector or sectors to be closed. These flags will be displayed by 8:00 a.m., and will be removed when firing ceases for the day. Suitable range markers will be erected indicating the bearings of the north and west limits of the Atlantic Ocean sector.

    (5) During the night firing, red lights will be displayed on the towers; and, in the case of the Atlantic Ocean sector, searchlights will be employed as barrier lights to enable safety observers to detect vessels which may attempt to enter the danger zone.

    (6) No person shall enter or remain within a 2 acre area surrounding a waterborne refueling training operation, in either the Grey Point Sector, Farnell Bay Sector, or Morgan Bay Sector as described in paragraph (b) of this section, for the duration of the training operation after a notice to conduct a waterborne refueling training operation has been published in the local notice to mariners and has been broadcast over the Marine Band radio network. The 2 acre area surrounding a waterborne refueling training operation will be patrolled and persons and vessels shall clear the area under patrol upon being warned by the surface patrol craft.

    (d)  (1) The water within an area described as follows: Beginning at latitude 34°37′32″, longitude 77°12′03″; thence to latitude 34°36′58″, longitude 77°11′25″; thence to latitude 34°37′44″, longitude 77°10′35″; thence to 34°32′27″, longitude 77°06′30″; thence to latitude 34°28′55″, longitude 77°15′05″; thence to latitude 34°34′50″, longitude 77°15′10″; thence to the point of beginning.

    (2)  Vessels may proceed along established waterways except during military training periods. Warning of military training periods will be given through Notices to Mariners and by displaying one hour prior to commencement a red danger streamer during daylight hours or a red light at night, from a flag pole 40 feet in height located at the U.S. Coast Guard Life Boat Station, Bogue Inlet, Swansboro, North Carolina, and from observation tower 40 feet in height located at the northern end of Onslow (Hurst) Beach. Prior to bombing and firing operations, the area will be searched by plane. Watercraft in the area will be warned by aircraft “buzzing” of the impending target practice. Upon being so warned, all persons and vessels shall leave the area as quickly as possible by the most direct route.

    (e) —(1)  Navigable waters between Bear Creek and Onslow Beach Bridge to include all inlets, streams, bays, and water therein contained, bounded on the north by Bear Creek, on the east and south by the Atlantic Ocean, to the meridian 77°16′20″; thence by this meridian to latitude 34°34′31″; and thence by a line bearing 44° from this point until the line intersects Bear Creek.

    (2)  (i) No person shall enter or remain in the waters of this area due the possibility of unexploded projectiles.

    (ii) Vessels may proceed through the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the area without stopping except in cases of extreme emergencies.

    (iii) All navigable waters in the area between the south bank of Bear Creek and the north bank of the north connecting channel between the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and Browns Inlet shall be closed to navigation at all times. There are highly sensitive unexploded projectiles within the limits of this area.

    (iv) Vessels may proceed through the north connecting channel and the south connecting channel (Banks Channel) in the area between the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and Browns Inlet to the Atlantic Ocean without stopping during periods of nonmilitary use. Caution should be used when proceeding through these waters due to the presence of unexploded projectiles lying in this area.

    (v) Navigable waters in the area between the south connecting channel (Banks Channel) leading to Browns Inlet and Onslow Beach Bridge on both sides of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway are open to unrestricted navigation during periods of nonmilitary use. An unknown element of risk exists in this area due to the possible presence of unexploded projectiles.

    (vi) Warning of impending military use of the area will be contained in weekly Notice to Mariners.

    (vii) Vessels having specific authority from the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, may enter the area.

    (f)  The regulations of this section shall be enforced by the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, or his authorized representatives.

    (a)  An area about 45 statute miles wide and 60 statute miles long, approximately parallel to and about 30 miles off the west coast of Florida, south of Apalachee Bay. The area is bounded as follows: Beginning at latitude 29°42′30″, longitude 84°40′00″; thence east along latitude 29°42′30″ to longitude 84°00′00″; thence southeast to latitude 28°56′00″, longitude 83°31′00″; thence southwest to latitude 28°37′00″, longitude 84°11′00″; thence northwest to latitude 29°17′30″, longitude 84°40′00″; thence northwest to latitude 29°32′00″, longitude 85°00′00″; thence northeast along a line three miles off the meanderings of the shore to the point of beginning.

    (b)  (1) The fact that aerial rocket firing will be conducted over the danger zone will be advertised to the public through the usual media for the dissemination of information. Inasmuch as such firing is likely to be conducted during the day or night throughout the year without regard to season, such advertising of firing will be repeated at intervals not exceeding three months and at more frequent intervals when in the opinion of the enforcing agency, repetition is necessary in the interest of public safety.

    (2) Prior to the conduct of rocket firing, the area will be patrolled by surface patrol boat and/or patrol aircraft to insure that no persons or watercraft are within the danger zone and to warn any such persons or watercraft seen in the vicinity that rocket firing is about to take place in the area. When aircraft is used to patrol the area, low flight of the aircraft across the bow will be used as a signal or warning.

    (3) Any such person or watercraft shall, upon being so warned, immediately leave the area, and until the conclusion of the firing shall remain at such a distance that they will be safe from the fallout resulting from such rocket firing.

    (4) The regulations in this section shall not deny access to or egress from harbors contiguous to the danger zone in the case of regular passenger or cargo carrying vessels proceeding to or from such harbors. In the case of the presence of any such vessel in the danger zone the officer in charge shall cause the cessation or postponement of fire until the vessel shall have cleared that part of the area in which it might be endangered by the fallout. The vessel shall proceed on its normal course and shall not delay its progress unnecessarily. Masters are requested to avoid the danger zone whenever possible so that interference with firing training may be minimized.

    (a)  (1) The coordinates provided herein are approximations obtained using a commercial mapping program which utilizes simple cylindrical projection with a WGS84 datum for its imagery base and imagery dated February 15 and May 3, 2014.

    (2) Each portion of the temporary restricted area described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (xxiii) of this section shall encompass all navigable waters of the United States as defined at 33 CFR part 329 within the area described and includes all contiguous inland navigable waters which lie within the land boundaries of Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB).

    (3) Because of the dynamic nature of these geographic features near barrier islands, the coordinate points provided may not reflect the current situation regarding the location of a point at the mean high water line or 500 feet waterward of the mean high water line. Even if the landform has shifted through erosion or accretion, the intent of the area description will be enforced from the existing point at the mean high water line that is closest to the shoreline point provided herein out to a point located 500 feet waterward of the mean high water line.

    (4) The restricted area will be partitioned using 23 pairs of coordinates to facilitate quick geographic recognition. The first point in each pair of coordinates is located on the shoreline, and the second point is a point 500 feet waterward of the shoreline. From the first point in each pair of coordinates, a line meanders irregularly following the shoreline and connects to the first point in the next pair of coordinates. From the second point in each pair of coordinates, a line beginning 500 feet waterward of the shoreline meanders irregularly following the shoreline at a distance of 500 feet waterward of the shoreline and connects to the second point in the next pair of coordinates.

    (2) During times when the restricted area defined in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (xxiii) of this section is not active, U.S. Air Force boat patrols may operate in the waters adjacent to Tyndall AFB's shoreline to observe the shoreline in order to identify any threats to the installation or personnel. U.S. Air Force personnel will not have any authority to enforce federal, state, or local laws on the water.

    (3) Due to the nature of security threats, restricted area activation may occur with little advance notice. Activation will be based on local or national intelligence information related to threats against military installations and/or resources common to Tyndall AFB in concert with evaluations conducted by the Tyndall AFB Threat Working Group and upon direction of the Installation Commander, Tyndall AFB. The Installation Commander activates only those portions of the restricted area identified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (xxiii) of this section that are necessary to provide the level of security required in response to the specific and credible threat(s) triggering the activation. The duration of activation for any portion(s) of the restricted area defined in paragraph (a) of this section, singularly or in combination, will be limited to those periods where it is warranted or required by security threats. Activated portions of the restricted area will be reevaluated every 48 hours to determine if the threat(s) triggering the activation or related threats warrant continued activation. The activated portion(s) of the restricted area expire if no reevaluation occurs or if the Installation Commander determines that activation is no longer warranted.

    (4) Public notification of a temporary waterway restricted area activation by the Installation Commander will be made by the 325 Fighter Wing Public Affairs office using all available mediums (marine VHF broadcasts [channels 13 and 16], local notices to mariners, local news media releases, social media postings on both the Tyndall official Web page [] and Facebook [], radio beepers through locally broadcasting stations, and the Tyndall Straight Talk [recorded telephone line 1-478-222-0011]). These mediums will be updated should the waterway restriction be extended beyond the initial 48 hour activation and/or terminated upon direction of the Installation Commander.

    (5) During times when the Installation Commander activates any portion(s) of the temporary restricted area defined in paragraph (a) of this section all entry, transit, drifting, anchoring or attaching any object to the submerged sea-bottom within the activated portion(s) of the restricted area is not allowed without the written permission of the Installation Commander, Tyndall AFB, Florida or his/her authorized representative. Previously affixed mooring balls established to support watercraft during intense weather conditions ( tropical storms, hurricanes, etc.) may remain within the activated portion(s) of the restricted area, however watercraft should not be anchored to the mooring balls without the permission of the Installation Commander, Tyndall AFB, Florida or his/her authorized representative.

    (c)  The regulations in this section shall be enforced by the Installation Commander, Tyndall AFB and/or such persons or agencies as he/she may designate.

    § 334.1250   Carr Inlet, naval restricted areas.

#### § § 334.1250

    (a) —(1)  The Waters of Carr Inlet bounded on the southeast by a line running from Gibson Point on Fox Island to Hyde Point on McNeil Island, on the northwest by a line running from Green Point (at latitude 47°16′54″ N, longitude 122°41′33″ W) to Penrose Point; plus that portion of Pitt Passage extending from Carr Inlet to Pitt Island, and that portion of Hale Passage extending from Carr Inlet southeasterly to a line drawn perpendicular to the channel 500 yards northwesterly of the Fox Island Bridge.

    (2)  (i) The area shall be used as an acoustic range for research studies and special noise trials. No explosive shall be used.

    (ii) No marine craft of any type shall at anytime approach or remain within one hundred yards of the hydrophone buoys. The hydrophone buoys will be anchored in Carr Inlet on a line perpendicular to the course line opposite Ketner's Point, and about one mile from the Fox Island shore. The course line, or range, will bear 134°38′21″ (314°38′21″) true, and will be marked by range beacons erected near the shoreline approximately one mile north-northeast of of Steilacoom and approximately two miles north-northeast of Home.

    (iii)  No vessel shall, at anytime, anchor or tow a drag of any kind within 1,000 yards of the buoy testing area.

    (iv) The remainder of the area shall be open to navigation at all times except when the range is in use or when hydrophones are being calibrated. When the range is in use or hydrophones are being calibrated, quick flashing beacon lights will be displayed on signal towers located at Gibson Point, Green Point, Penrose Point, Pitt Island and Hyde Point. These beacon lights will be either red or green. The beacon lights will show quick flashing every two seconds. The ranging of vessels or calibration of hydrophones requiring retrictions will be conducted 24 hours per day for up to 5 days consecutively, and will total approximately 150 days spread throughout the year. Shutting off of beacon lights will indicate termination of use of the range. Insofar as possible, the schedule of operations giving the days the range will be in use for each forthcoming month will be published in local newspapers and in the local U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners.

    (v) When the red beacon lights are displayed, indicating that the range is in use or hydrophones are being calibrated, navigation within the area will be restricted as follows:

    () As used in this section, the words “oper_a_te, power vessel, and non-power vessel” are defined as follows:

    () “Operate”: To be physically present in the designated area.

    () “Power vessel”: A vessel propelled principally by a mechanical propulsion system (, gasoline, diesel, steam or electric drive to a propeller, pump jet, paddle wheel or other device), and being propelled by that means.

    () “Non-power vessel”: A vessel not equipped with a mechanical propulsion system, such as a rowboat, canoe, or sailboat propelled by oars, paddles, or sails, respectively.

    () Power vessels shall not operate within the area, except that traffic in either direction _b_etween Hale Passage and upper Carr Inlet, within 200 yards of the low water mark off Green Point, will be cleared by signal for approximately 15 minutes total time within this area at the termination of individual ranging runs, while the vessel being ranged takes position for the next run. Clearance to traverse the area around Green Point will be indicated by extinguishing the red flashing beacon lights and displaying the green flashing beacon lights on all signal towers.

    () Non-powered marine _c_raft shall not operate within one mile of the course line bearing 134°38′21″ (314°38′21″) true, and within two miles to the southeast and two miles to the northwest of the hydrophone buoys situated in Carr Inlet opposite Ketner's Point; provided, however, non-powered craft may operate within four hundred yards of the low water mark on the northeast side of McNeil Island, within two hundred yards of the low water mark at Green Point, and within two hundred yards of the low water mark on the southwest shore of Fox Island.

    () Towboats shall have free access an_d_ egress to designated tow havens within Carr Inlet, as follows: The Navy will establish and maintain suitable mooring buoys for the use of tugs and their tows at the following points: () approximately _1_,500 yards northwest of Gibson Point Light and approximately 400 yards offshore from the low water mark on the Fox Island shore; () approximately 1,500 yards northwest of Hyde Point, and approximately 400 yards offshore from the low water mark on McNeil Island shore; and () approximately 1,500 yards east of Wyckoff Shoal. Towboats will signal by radio (Marine Band Channel 14, 1_3_, 1_2_, or 6) or telephone as far in advance as possible of the time they enter the tow haven, such signals to be directed to “Carr Inlet Range Control” at the range instrument laboratory building located on Fox Island. The Navy shall promptly suspend operations when necessary to permit the access and egress of such tow traffic, and Carr Inlet Range Control shall signal the tows when the area is clear.

    () Through comm_e_rcial traffic, including tows, to points within Carr Inlet, and through Carr Inlet, Pitt Passage, and Hale Passage to adjacent waters will be permitted free access and egress, as follows: Such traffic will signal by radio (Marine Band Channel 14, 13, 12, or 6) or telephone as far in advance as possible of the time they enter the area, such signals to be directed to “Carr Inlet Range Control” at the range instrument laboratory located on Fox Island. The Navy shall promptly suspend operations when necessary to permit the passage of such traffic, and Carr Inlet Range Control shall signal when the area is clear for passage.

    () The Warden o_f_ the McNeil Island penitentiary and his authorized representatives shall be permitted to operate within the area at any time, as may be necessary, for the patrol and search of escaped convicts.

    () Red or _g_reen signal flags will be displayed on the signal towers in case of failure of the red or green beacon lights. The display or the signal flags at the top of the flag masts will have the same significance as the beacon lights.

    (3) The regulations in this paragraph shall be enforced by the Commander, Naval Base, Seattle, and such agencies as he/she may designate.

Factual information as to the dates, time, and characteristics of the firing will be advertised in advance of each session of firing but in no case less than one week nor more than four weeks before such firing is scheduled to take place.

    (3) Prior to conducting each practice firing, the entire danger zone will be patrolled by aircraft or surface vessels to insure that no watercraft are within the danger zone. Any watercraft in the vicinity will be warned that practice firing is about to take place. Any such watercraft shall, upon being so warned, leave the danger zone immediately and shall not return until such practice shall have been terminated and notification to that effect shall have been given by the patrol craft, except that vessels proceeding on a regular course through the area will be allowed to proceed out of the area without warning, and firing will not commence until such vessels are clear of the area.

    (4) This section shall be enforced by the Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces Antilles, and such agencies as he may designate.

  PART 335—OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CIVIL WORKS PROJECTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED OR FILL MATERIAL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S. OR OCEAN WATERS

### Part 335

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 U.S.C. 1413.

**Source:** Source: 53 FR 14911, Apr. 26, 1988, unless otherwise noted.

    § 335.1   Purpose.

#### § § 335.1

    This regulation prescribes the practices and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers to ensure compliance with the specific statutes governing Army Civil Works operations and maintenance projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal into ocean waters. These practices and procedures should be employed throughout the decision/management process concerning methodologies and alternatives to be used to ensure prudent operation and maintenance activities.

    § 335.2   Authority.

#### § § 335.2

    Under authority delegated from the Secretary of the Army and in accordance with section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (CWA) and section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, hereinafter referred to as the Ocean Dumping Act (ODA), the Corps of Engineers regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States and the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal into ocean waters. Section 404 of the CWA requires public notice with opportunity for public hearing for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. and that discharge sites can be specified through the application of guidelines developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army. Section 103 of the ODA requires public notice with opportunity for public hearing for the transportation for disposal of dredged material for disposal in ocean waters. Ocean disposal of dredged material must be evaluated using the criteria developed by the Administrator of EPA in consultation with the Secretary of the Army. Section 103(e) of the ODA provides that the Secretary of the Army may, in lieu of permit procedures, issue regulations for Federal projects involving the transportation of dredged material for ocean disposal which require the application of the same criteria, procedures, and requirements which apply to the issuance of permits. Similarly, the Corps does not issue itself a CWA permit to authorize Corps discharges of dredged material or fill material into U.S. waters, but does apply the 404(b)(1) guidelines and other substantive requirements of the CWA and other environmental laws.

    § 335.3   Applicability.

#### § § 335.3

    This regulation (33 CFR parts 335 through 338) is applicable to the Corps of Engineers when undertaking operation and maintenance activities at Army Civil Works projects.

    § 335.4   Policy.

#### § § 335.4

    The Corps of Engineers undertakes operations and maintenance activities where appropriate and environmentally acceptable. All practicable and reasonable alternatives are fully considered on an equal basis. This includes the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. or ocean waters in the least costly manner, at the least costly and most practicable location, and consistent with engineering and environmental requirements.

    § 336.0   General.

#### § § 336.0

    Since the jurisdiction of the CWA extends to all waters of the U.S., including the territorial sea, and the jurisdiction of the ODA extends over ocean waters including the territorial sea, the following rules are established to assure appropriate regulation of discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. and ocean waters.

    (a) The disposal into ocean waters, including the territorial sea, of dredged material excavated or dredged from navigable waters of the U.S. will be evaluated by the Corps in accordance with the ODA.

    (b) In those cases where the district engineer determines that the discharge of dredged material into the territorial sea would be for the primary purpose of fill, such as the use of dredged material for beach nourishment, island creation, or construction of underwater berms, the discharge will be evaluated under section 404 of the CWA.

    (c) For those cases where the district engineer determines that the materials proposed for discharge in the territorial sea would not be adequately evaluated under the section 404(b)(1) guidelines of the CWA, he may evaluate that material under the ODA.

    § 336.1   Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.

#### § § 336.1

    (a)  Section 404 of the CWA governs the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. Although the Corps does not process and issue permits for its own activities, the Corps authorizes its own discharges of dredged or fill material by applying all applicable substantive legal requirements, including public notice, opportunity for public hearing, and application of the section 404(b)(1) guidelines.

    (1) The CWA requires the Corps to seek state water quality certification for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.

    (2) Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires that certain activities that a Federal agency conducts or supports be consistent with the Federally-approved state management plan to the maximum extent practicable.

    (b)  If changes in a previously approved disposal plan for a Corps navigation project warrant re-evaluation under the CWA, the following procedures should be followed by district engineers prior to discharging dredged material into waters of the U.S. except where emergency action as described in § 337.7 of this chapter is required.

    (1) A public notice providing opportunity for a public hearing should be issued at the earliest practicable time. The public notification procedures of § 337.1 of this chapter should be followed.

    (2) The public hearing procedures of 33 CFR part 327 should be followed.

    (3) As soon as practicable, the district engineer will request from the state a 401 water quality certification and, if applicable, provide a coastal zone consistency determination for the Corps activity using the procedures of § 336.1(b) (8) and (9), respectively, of this part.

    (4) Discharges of dredged material will be evaluated using the guidelines authorized under section 404(b)(1) of the CWA, or using the ODA regulations, where appropriate. If the guidelines alone would prohibit the designation of a proposed discharge site, the economic impact on navigation and anchorage of the failure to use the proposed discharge site will also be considered in evaluating whether the proposed discharge is to be authorized under CWA section 404(b)(2).

    (5) The EPA Administrator can prohibit or restrict the use of any defined area as a discharge site under 404(c) whenever he determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing and after consultation with the Secretary of the Army, that the discharge of such materials into such areas will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreation areas. Upon notification of the prohibition of a discharge site by the Administrator the district engineer will complete the administrative processing of the proposed project up to the point of signing the Statement of Findings (SOF) or Record of Decision (ROD). The unsigned SOF or ROD along with a report described in § 337.8 of this chapter will be forwarded through the appropriate Division office to the Dredging Division, Office of the Chief of Engineers.

    (6) In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Environmental Assessment (EA) will be prepared for all Corps of Engineers projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material, unless such projects are included within a categorical exclusion found at 33 CFR part 230 or addressed within an existing EA or EIS. If a proposed maintenance activity will result in a deviation in the operation and maintenance plan as described in the EA or EIS, the district engineer will determine the need to prepare a new EA, EIS, or supplement. If a new EA, EIS, or supplement is required, the procedures of 33 CFR part 230 will be followed.

    (7) If it can be anticipated that related work by other Federal or non-Federal interests will occur in the same area as Corps projects, the district engineer should use all reasonable means to include it in the planning, processing, and review of Corps projects. Related work normally includes, but is not necessarily limited to, maintenance dredging of approach channels and berthing areas connected to Federal navigation channels. The district engineer should coordinate the related work with interested Federal, state, regional, and local agencies and the general public at the same time he does so for the Corps project. The district engineer should ensure that related work meets all substantive and procedural requirements of 33 CFR parts 320 through 330. Documents covering Corps maintenance activities normally should also include an appropriate discussion of ancillary maintenance work. District engineers should assist local interests to obtain from the state any necessary section 401 water quality certification and, if required, the section 307 coastal zone consistency concurrence. The absence of such certification or concurrence by the state or the denial of a Corps permit for related work shall not be cause for delay of the Federal project. Local sponsors will be responsible for funding any related work. If permitting of the related work complies with all legal requirements and is not contrary to the public interest, section 10, 404, and 103 permits normally will be issued by the district engineer in a separate SOF or ROD. Authorization by nationwide or regional general permit may be appropriate. If the related work does not receive a necessary state water quality certification and/or CZMA consistency concurrence, or are determined to be contrary to the public interest the district engineer should re-examine the project viability to ensure that continued maintenance is warranted.

    (8)  Section 401 of the CWA requires the Corps to seek state water quality certification for dredged material disposal into waters of the U.S. The state certification request must be processed to a conclusion by the state within a reasonable period of time. Otherwise, the certification requirements of section 401 are deemed waived. The district engineer will request water quality certification from the state at the earliest practicable time using the following procedures:

    (i) In addition to the Corps section 404 public notice, information and data demonstrating compliance with state water quality standards will be provided to the state water quality certifying agency along with the request for water quality certification. The information and data may be included within the 404(b)(1) evaluation. The district engineer will request water quality certification to be consistent with the maintenance dredging schedule for the project. Submission of the public notice, including information and data demonstrating compliance with the state water quality standards, will constitute a valid water quality certification request pursuant to section 401 of the CWA.

    (ii) If the proposed disposal activity may violate state water quality standards, after consideration of disposal site dilution and dispersion, the district engineer will work with the state to acquire data to satisfy compliance with the state water quality standards. The district engineer will use the technical manual “Management Strategy for Disposal of Dredged Material: Contaminant Testing and Controls” or its appropriate updated version as a guide for developing the appropriate tests to be conducted on such dredged material.

    (iii) If the state does not take final action on a request for water quality certification within two months from the date of the initial request, the district engineer will notify the state of his intention to presume a waiver as provided by section 401 of the CWA. If the state agency, within the two-month period, requests an extension of time, the district engineer may approve one 30-day extension unless, in his opinion, the magnitude and complexity of the information contained in the request warrants a longer or additional extension period. The total period of time in which the state must act should not exceed six months from the date of the initial request. Waiver of water quality certification can be conclusively presumed after six months from the date of the initial request.

    (iv) The procedures of § 337.2 will be followed if the district engineer determines that the state data acquisition requirements exceed those necessary in establishment of the Federal standard.

    (9)  Section 307 of the CZMA requires that activities subject to the CZMA which a Federal agency conducts or supports be consistent with the Federally approved state management program to the maximum extent practicable. The state is provided a reasonable period of time as defined in § 336.1(b)(9)(iv) to take final action on Federal consistency determinations; otherwise state concurrence can be presumed. The district engineer will provide the state a consistency determination at the earliest practicable time using the following procedures:

    (i) The Corps section 404 public notice and any additional information that the district engineer determines to be appropriate will be provided the state coastal zone management agency along with the consistency determination. The consistency determination will consider the maintenance dredging schedule for the project. Submission of the public notice and, as appropriate, any additional information as determined by the district engineer will constitute a valid coastal zone consistency determination pursuant to section 307 of the CZMA.

    (ii) If the district engineer decides that a consistency determination is not required for a Corps activity, he may provide the state agency a written determination that the CZMA does not apply.

    (iii) The district engineer may provide the state agency a general consistency determination for routine or repetitive activities.

    (iv) If the state fails to provide a response within 45 days from receipt of the initial consistency determination, the district engineer will presume state agency concurrence. If the state agency, within the 45-day period, requests an extension of time, the district engineer will approve one 15-day extension unless, in his opinion, the magnitude and complexity of the information contained in the consistency determination warrants a longer or additional extension period. The longer or additional extension period shall not exceed six months from the date of the initial consistency determination.

    (v) If the district engineer determines that the state recommendations to achieve consistency to the maximum degree practicable exceed either his authority or funding for a proposed dredging or disposal activity, he will so notify the state coastal zone management agency indicating that the Corps has complied to the maximum extent practicable with the state's coastal zone management program. If the district engineer determines that state recommendations to achieve consistency to the maximum degree practicable do not exceed his authority or funding but, nonetheless, are excessive, he will follow the procedures of § 337.2.

    (c)  The following factors will be used, as appropriate, to evaluate the discharge of dredged material into waters of the U.S. Other relevant factors may also be evaluated, as needed.

    (1)  The maintenance of a reliable Federal navigation system is essential to the economic well-being and national defense of the country. The district engineer will give full consideration to the impact of the failure to maintain navigation channels on the national and, as appropriate, regional economy. It is the Corps' policy to regulate the discharge of dredged material from its projects to assure that dredged material disposal occurs in the least costly, environmentally acceptable manner, consistent with engineering requirements established for the project. The environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, in conjunction with the section 404(b)(1) guidelines and public notice coordination process, can be used as a guide in formulating environmentally acceptable alternatives. The least costly alternative, consistent with sound engineering practices and selected through the 404(b)(1) guidelines or ocean disposal criteria, will be designated the Federal standard for the proposed project.

    (2)  The 404(b)(1) guidelines at 40 CFR part 230 and ocean dumping criteria at 40 CFR part 220 implement the environmental protection provisions of the CWA and ODA, respectively. These guidelines and criteria provide general regulatory guidance and objectives, but not a specific technical framework for evaluating or managing contaminated sediment that must be dredged. Through the section 404(b)(1) evaluation process (or ocean disposal criteria for the territorial sea), the district engineer will evaluate the water quality impacts of the proposed project. The evaluation will include consideration of state water quality standards. If the district engineer determines the dredged material to be contaminated, he will follow the guidance provided in the most current published version of the technical manual for contaminant testing and controls. This manual is currently cited as: Francingues, N.R., Jr., et al. 1985. “Management Strategy for Disposal of Dredged Material: Contaminant Testing and Controls,” Miscellaneous Paper D-85-1, U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Mississippi. The procedures of § 336.1(b)(8) will be followed for state water quality certification requests.

    (3)  As appropriate, the district engineer will determine whether the proposed project is consistent with the state coastal zone management program to the maximum extent practicable. The procedures of § 336.1(b)(9) will be followed for coastal zone consistency determinations.

    (4)  Most wetland areas constitute a productive and valuable public resource, the unnecessary alteration or destruction of which should be discouraged as contrary to the public interest. The district engineer will, therefore, follow the guidance in 33 CFR 320.4(b) and EO 11990, dated May 24, 1977, when evaluating Corps operations and maintenance activities in wetlands.

    (5)  All Corps operations and maintenance activities will be reviewed for the potential impact on threatened or endangered species, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973. If the district engineer determines that the proposed activity will not affect listed species or their critical habitat, a statement to this effect should be included in the public notice. If the proposed activity may affect listed species or their critical habitat, appropriate discussions will be initiated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service, and a statement to this effect should be included in the public notice. (See 50 CFR part 402).

    (6)  Archeological, historical, or architectural resource surveys may be required to locate and identify previously unrecorded historic properties in navigation channels and at dredged or fill material disposal sites. If properties that may be historic are known or found to exist within the navigation channel or proposed disposal area, field testing and analysis may sometimes be necessary in order to evaluate the properties against the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places. Such testing should be limited to the amount and kind needed to determine eligibility for the National Register; more detailed and extensive work on a property may be prescribed later, as the outcome of review under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Historic properties are not normally found in previously constructed navigation channels or previously used disposal areas. Therefore, surveys to identify historic properties should not be conducted for maintenance dredging and disposal activities proposed within the boundaries of previously constructed navigation channels or previously used disposal areas unless there is good reason to believe that historic properties exist there.

    (i) The district engineer will establish whether historic properties located in navigation channels or at disposal sites are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with applicable regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Department of the Interior.

    (ii) The district engineer will take into account the effects of any proposed actions on properties included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, and will request the comments of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in accordance with applicable regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

    (7)  (i) Maintenance dredging and disposal activities may involve areas which possess recognized scenic, recreational, or similar values. Full evaluation requires that due consideration be given to the effect which dredging and disposal of the dredged or fill material may have on the enhancement, preservation, or development of such values. Recognition of these values is often reflected by state, regional, or local land use classification or by similar Federal controls or policies. Operations and maintenance activities should, insofar as possible, be consistent with and avoid adverse effects on the values or purposes for which such resources have been recognized or set aside, and for which those classifications, controls, or policies were established. Special consideration must be given to rivers named in section 3 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and those proposed for inclusion as provided by section 4 and 5 of the Act, or by later legislation.

    (ii) Any other areas named in Acts of Congress or Presidential Proclamations, such as National Rivers, National Wilderness Areas, National Seashores, National Parks, and National Monuments, should be given full consideration when evaluating Corps operations and maintenance activities.

    (8)  (i) In those cases where the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) applies, district engineers will consult, through the public notification process, with the Regional Directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service and the head of the agency responsible for fish and wildlife for the state in which the work is to be performed, with a view to the conservation of fish and wildlife resources by considering ways to prevent their direct and indirect loss and damage due to the proposed operation and maintenance activity. The district engineer will give full consideration to these views on fish and wildlife conservation in evaluating the activity. The proposed operations may be modified in order to lessen the damage to such resources. The district engineer should include such justifiable means and measures for fish and wildlife resources that are found to be appropriate. Corps funding of Fish and Wildlife Service activities under the Transfer of Funds Agreement between the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps is not applicable for Corps operation and maintenance projects.

    (ii) District engineers should consider ways of reducing unavoidable adverse environmental impacts of dredging and disposal activities. The determination as to the extent of implementation of such measures will be done by the district engineer after weighing the benefits and detriments of the maintenance work and considering applicable environmental laws, regulations, and other relevant factors.

    (9)  Operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material in a marine sanctuary established by the Secretary of Commerce under authority of section 302 of the ODA should be evaluated for the impact on the marine sanctuary. In such a case, certification should be obtained from the Secretary of Commerce that the proposed project is consistent with the purposes of Title III of the ODA and can be carried out within the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce to control activities within the marine sanctuary.

    (10)  District engineers will make all reasonable efforts to comply with state water quality standards and Federally approved coastal zone programs using the procedures of §§ 336.1(b) (8), (9), and 337.2. District engineers should not seek state permits or licenses unless authorized to do so by a clear, explicit, and unambiguous Congressional waiver of Federal sovereign immunity, giving the state authority to impose that requirement on Federal activities (e.g., CWA sections 401 and 404(t), and CZMA section 307 (c)(1) and (c)(2)).

    (11)  In addition to the factors described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section, the following factors should also be considered.

    (i) The evaluation of Corps operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. is a continuing process and should proceed concurrently with the processing of state water quality certification and, if required, the provision of a coastal zone consistency determination to the state. If a local agency having jurisdiction over or concern with the particular activity comments on the project through the public notice coordination, due consideration should be given to those official views as a reflection of local factors.

    (ii) Where officially adopted state, regional, or local land use classifications, determinations, or policies are applicable, they normally will be presumed to reflect local views and will be considered in addition to other national factors.

    § 336.2   Transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal into ocean waters.

#### § § 336.2

    (a)  Section 103(a) of the ODA provides that the Corps of Engineers may issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, for the transportation of dredged material for disposal into ocean waters.

    (b)  The following procedures will be followed by district engineers for dredged material disposal into ocean waters except where emergency action as described in § 337.7 of this chapter is required.

    (1) In accordance with the provisions of section 103 of the ODA, the district engineer should issue a public notice giving opportunity for public hearing, following the procedures described in § 337.1 of this chapter for Corps operation and maintenance activities involving disposal of dredged material in ocean waters, as well as dredged material transported through the territorial sea for ocean disposal.

    (2) The public hearing procedures of 33 CFR part 327 should be followed.

    (c)  The terms and legislative history of the ODA leave some doubt regarding whether a state has legal authority to exert control over ocean dumping activities of the Corps in the territorial sea covered under the Act (see section 106(d)). Notwithstanding this legal question, the Corps will voluntarily as a matter of comity apply for state section 401 water quality certification and determine consistency with a Federally-approved coastal zone management plan for Corps ocean disposal of dredged material within the three-mile extent of the territorial sea. Moreover, the Corps will attempt to comply with any reasonable requirement imposed by a state in the course of the 401 certification process or the CZMA consistency determination process. Nevertheless, the Corps reserves its legal rights regarding any case where a state unreasonably denies or conditions a 401 water quality certification for proposed Corps ocean disposal of dredged material within the limits of the territorial sea, or asserts that such disposal would not be consistent with an approved state CZMA plan. If such a circumstance arises, the district engineer shall so notify the division engineer who then decides on consultation with CECW-D, CECW-Z, and CECC-E for purposes of determining the Corps of Engineers' appropriate response and course of action.

    (d)  (1) In addition to the appropriate evaluation factors of § 336.1(c), activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters will be evaluated by the Corps to determine whether the proposed disposal will unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems or economic potentialities. In making this evaluation, the district engineer, in addition to considering the criteria developed by EPA on the effects of the dumping, will also consider navigation, economic and industrial development, and foreign and domestic commerce, as well as the availability of alternatives to ocean disposal, in determining the need for ocean disposal of dredged material. Where ocean disposal is determined to be appropriate, the district engineer will, to the extent feasible, specify disposal sites which have been designated by the Administrator pursuant to section 102(c) of the ODA.

    (2) As provided by the EPA regulations at 40 CFR 225.2(b-e) for implementing the procedures of section 102 of the ODA, the regional administrator of EPA may make an independent evaluation of dredged material disposal activities regulated under section 103 of the ODA related to the effects of dumping. The EPA regulations provide that the regional administrator make said evaluation within 15 days after receipt of all requested information. The regional administrator may request from the district engineer an additional 15-day period for a total of to 30 days. The EPA regulations provide that the regional administrator notify the district engineer of non-compliance with the environmental impact criteria or with any restriction relating to critical areas on the use of an EPA recommended disposal site designated pursuant to section 102(c) of the ODA. In cases where the regional administrator has notified the district engineer in writing that the proposed disposal will not comply with the criteria related to the effects of dumping or related to critical area restriction, no dredged material disposal may occur unless and until the provisions of 40 CFR 225.3 are followed and the Administrator grants a waiver of the criteria pursuant to section 103(d) of the ODA.

    (3) If the regional administrator advises the district engineer that the proposed disposal will comply with the criteria, the district engineer will complete the administrative record and sign the SOF.

    (4) In situations where an EPA-designated site is not feasible for use or where no site has been designated by the EPA, the district engineer, in accordance with the ODA and in consultation with EPA, may select a site pursuant to section 103. Appropriate NEPA documentation should be used to support site selections. District engineers should address site selection factors in the NEPA document. District engineers will consider the criteria of 40 CFR parts 227 and 228 when selecting ocean disposal sites, as well as other technical and economic considerations. Emphasis will be placed on evaluation to determine the need for ocean disposal and other available alternatives. Each alternative should be fully considered on an equal basis, including the no dredging option.

    (5) If the regional administrator advises the district engineer that a proposed ocean disposal site or activity will not comply with the criteria, the district engineer should proceed as follows.

    (i) The district engineer should determine whether there is an economically feasible alternative method or site available other than the proposed ocean disposal site. If there are other feasible alternative methods or sites available, the district engineer will evaluate the engineering and economic feasibility and environmental acceptability of the alternative sites.

    (ii) If the district engineer makes a determination that there is no economically feasible alternative method or site available, he will so advise the regional administrator of his intent to proceed with the proposed action setting forth his reasons for such determination.

    (iii) If the regional administrator advises, within 15 days of the notice of the intent to issue, that he will commence procedures specified by section 103(c) of the ODA to prohibit use of a proposed disposal site, the case will be forwarded through the respective Division office and CECW-D to the Secretary of the Army or his designee for further coordination with the Administrator of EPA and final resolution. The report forwarding the case should be in the format described in § 337.8 of this chapter.

    (iv) The Secretary of the Army or his designee will evaluate the proposed project and make a final determination on the proposed disposal. If the decision of the Secretary of the Army or his designee is that ocean disposal at the proposed site is required because of the unavailability of economically feasible alternatives, he will seek a waiver from the Administrator, EPA, of the criteria or of the critical site designation in accordance with section 103(d) of the ODA.

  PART 337—PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE

### Part 337

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 U.S.C. 1413.

**Source:** Source: 53 FR 14916, Apr. 26, 1988, unless otherwise noted.

    § 337.0   Purpose.

#### § § 337.0

    The practices and procedures part of this regulation apply to all Corps operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the U.S. and ocean waters and related activities of local interests accomplished to ensure continued functions of constructed Corps projects.

    § 337.1   Public notice.

#### § § 337.1

    Presently, public notification of proposed discharges of dredged or fill material is required by the provisions of section 103 of the ODA and sections 401 and 404 of the CWA. District engineers are encouraged to develop procedures to avoid unnecessary duplication of state agency procedures. Joint public notification procedures should be a primary factor in the development of Memoranda of Agreement with the states as described in § 337.4.

    (a) With the possible exception of emergency actions as discussed in § 337.7, the district engineer should issue a public notice for projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. or ocean waters unless the project is authorized by a general permit. Public notices for Corps operation and maintenance activities are normally issued for an indefinite period of time and are not reissued unless changes in the disposal plan warrant re-evaluation under section 404 of the CWA or section 103 of the ODA. The public notice is the primary method of advising all interested parties of Federal projects and of soliciting comments and information necessary to evaluate the probable impact of the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. or ocean waters. The notice should, therefore, include sufficient information to provide a clear understanding of the nature of the activity and related activities of local interests in order to generate meaningful comments. A single public notice may be used for more than one project in appropriate cases. The notice normally should include the following items:

    (1) The name and location of the project and proposed disposal site.

    (2) A general description of the project and a description of the estimated type, composition, and quantity of materials to be discharged, the proposed time schedule for the dredging activity, and the types of equipment and methods of dredging and conveyance proposed to be used.

    (3) A sketch showing the location of the project, including depth of water in the area and all proposed discharge sites.

    (4) The nature, estimated amount, and frequency of known and anticipated related dredging and discharge to be conducted by others.

    (5) A list of Federal, state, and local environmental agencies with whom the activity is being coordinated.

    (6) A statement concerning a preliminary determination of the need for and/or availability of an environmental impact statement.

    (7) Any other available information which may assist interested parties in evaluating the likely impact of the proposed activity, if any.

    (8) A reasonable period of time, normally thirty days but not less than fifteen days from date of mailing except in emergency situations where the procedures of § 337.7 will be followed, within which interested parties may express their views concerning the proposed project.

    (9) If the proposed Federal project would occur in the territorial seas or ocean waters, a description of the project's relationship to the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.

    (10) A statement on the status of state water quality certification under section 401 of the CWA.

    (11) For activities requiring a determination of consistency with an approved state coastal zone management plan, the following information will be included in the notice:

    (i) A statement on whether or not the proposed activity will be undertaken in a manner consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the state management program.

    (ii) Sufficient information to support the consistency determination to include associated facilities and their coastal zone effect.

    (iii) Data and supporting information commensurate with the expected effects of the activity on the coastal zone.

    (12) A statement on historic resources, state of present knowledge, likelihood of damage or other adverse effect on such resources, etc.

    (13) A statement on endangered species.

    (14) A statement on evaluation factors to be considered, adapted from that presented at 33 CFR 325.3(b).

    (15) The name, address, and telephone number of the Corps employee from whom additional information concerning the project may be obtained.

    (16) The signature of the district engineer or his designee on all maintenance dredged material disposal public notices.

    (17) For activities regulated under section 103 of the ODA, the following additional information should be integrated into the public notice:

    (i) A statement on the designation status of the disposal site.

    (ii) If the proposed disposal site is not a designated site, a description of the characteristics of the proposed disposal site and an explanation as to why no previously designated disposal site is feasible.

    (iii) A brief description of known dredged material discharges at the proposed disposal site.

    (iv) Existence and documented effects of other authorized disposals that have been made at the disposal area.

    (v) An estimated length of time during which disposal would continue at the proposed site.

    (vi) Information on the characteristics and composition of the dredged material, and the following paragraph:

    (b) The following statement should be included in the public notices:

    (c) Public notices should be distributed as described in 33 CFR 325.3(c). In addition, public notices should be sent to CECW-D, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314, if the project involves the discharge of dredged material in waters of the U.S. or ocean waters. District engineers should also develop, as appropriate, regional mailing lists for Corps maintenance dredging and disposal activities to the extent that property owners adjacent to the navigation channel and disposal area are notified of the proposed activity. In order to effect compliance with Executive Order 12372, district engineers should provide copies of public notices to concerned state and local elected officials.

    (d) The district engineer should consider all comments received in response to the public notice in his subsequent actions. All comments expressing objections to or raising questions about the project should be acknowledged. Comments received as form letters or petitions, however, may be acknowledged as a group to the person or organization responsible for the form letter or petition. If comments are received which relate to matters within the special expertise of another agency, the district engineer may seek the advice of that agency. The receipt of comments as a result of the public notice normally should not extend beyond the stated comment period; however, at his discretion, the district engineer may provide an extension.

    (e) Notices sent to several agencies within the same state may result in conflicting comments from those agencies. Many states have designated a state agency or individual to provide a single and coordinated state position regarding Federal activities. Where a state has not so designated a single source, the district engineer, as appropriate, may seek from the Governor an expression of his views and desires concerning the proposed and subsequent similar projects.

    (f) All comments received from the public notice coordination should be considered in the public interest review process. Comments received from Federal or state agencies which are within the area of expertise of another agency will be communicated with that other agency if the district engineer needs the information to make a final determination on the proposed project.

    § 337.2   State requirements.

#### § § 337.2

    The procedures of this section should be followed in implementing state requirements.

    (a) District engineers should cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with state agencies to prevent violation of Federally approved state water quality standards and to achieve consistency to the maximum degree practicable with an approved coastal zone management program.

    (b) If the state agency imposes conditions or requirements which exceed those needed to meet the Federal standard, the district engineer should determine and consider the state's rationale and provide to the state information addressing why the alternative which represents the Federal standard is environmentally acceptable. The district engineer will accommodate the state's concerns to the extent practicable. However, if a state agency attempts to impose conditions or controls which, in the district engineers opinion, cannot reasonably be accommodated, the following procedures will be followed.

    (1) In situations where an agency requires monitoring or testing, the district engineer will strive to reach an agreement with the agency on a data acquisition program. The district engineer will use the technical manual “Management Strategy for Disposal of Dredged Material: Contaminant Testing and Controls” or its appropriate updated version as a guide for developing the appropriate tests to be conducted. If the agency insists on requirements which, in the opinion of the district engineer, exceed those required in establishment of the Federal standard, the agency will be asked to fund the difference in cost. If the agency agrees to fund the difference in cost, the district engineer will comply with the request. If the agency does not fund the additional cost, the district engineer will follow the guidance in paragraph (b) (3) of this section.

    (2) When an agency requires special conditions or implementation of an alternative which the Federal standard does not, district engineers will proceed as follows: In those cases where the project authorization requires a local sponsor to provide suitable disposal areas, disposal areas must be made available by a sponsor before dredging proceeds. In other cases where there are no local sponsor requirements to provide disposal areas, the state or the prospective local sponsor will be advised that, unless the state or the sponsor provides suitable disposal areas, the added Federal cost of providing these disposal areas will affect the priority of performing dredging on that project. In either case, states will be made aware that additional costs to meet state standards or the requirements of the coastal zone management program which exceed those necessary in establishment of the Federal standard may cause the project to become economically unjustified.

    (3) If the state denies or notifies the district engineer of its intent to deny water quality certification or does not concur regarding coastal zone consistency, the project dredging may be deferred. A report pursuant to § 337.8 of this section will be forwarded to CECW-D, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314-1000 for resolution.

    § 337.3   Transfer of the section 404 program to the states.

#### § § 337.3

    Section 404(g-1) of the CWA allows the Administrator of the EPA to transfer to qualified states administration of the section 404 permit program for discharges into certain waters of the U.S. Once a state's 404 program is approved, the district engineer will follow state procedures developed in accordance with section 404(g-1) of the CWA for all on-going Corps projects involving the discharge of fill material in transferred waters to the state agency responsible for administering the program. Corps projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters not transferred to the state will be processed in accordance with this regulation.

    § 337.4   Memoranda of Agreement (MOA).

#### § § 337.4

    The establishment of joint notification procedures for Corps projects involving disposal of dredged or fill material should be actively pursued through the development of MOAs with the state. The MOAs may be used to define responsibilities between the state and the Corps district involved. The primary purpose of MOAs will be to avoid or eliminate administrative duplication, when such duplication does not contribute to the overall decision-making process. MOAs for purposes of this regulation will not be used to implement provisions not related to the maintenance or enforcement of Federally-approved state water quality standards or coastal zone management programs. District engineers are authorized and encouraged to develop MOAs with states and other Federal agencies for Corps projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material. Copies of all MOAs will be forwarded to CECW-D, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314-1000 for approval.

    § 337.5   General authorizations.

#### § § 337.5

    Under the provisions of sections 404(e) of the CWA and 104(c) of the ODA certain categories of activities may be authorized on a regional, statewide, or nationwide basis. General authorizations can be a useful mechanism for implementation of the procedural provisions of the CWA, CZMA, and ODA while avoiding unnecessary duplication and paperwork. Through the general authorization process, compliance with all environmental laws and regulations including coastal zone consistency, if applicable, and water quality certification can be accomplished in a single process for a category of activities. Since the emphasis of particular environmental issues for most Corps projects is more regional than nationwide, district engineers are encouraged to develop general authorizations for routine Civil Works activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill material to address the specific requirements of a particular geographic region. When evaluating general categories of activities, the district engineer should follow the same procedure as outlined for individual Federal activities including the water quality certification and/or coastal zone consistency requirements of part 336 of this chapter. General authorizations should include related activities of local interests. Additionally, district engineers should use existing general permits authorized on a statewide or regional basis and the nationwide permits at 33 CFR part 330 for Federal projects involving the disposal of dredged material. The development of new statewide or regional general authorizations for Federal activities should be in accordance with the requirements of §§ 336.1 and 336.2 of this chapter. General permits for related activities of local interests should be developed using the procedures of 33 CFR parts 320 through 330.

    § 337.6   Statement of Findings (SOF).

#### § § 337.6

    Upon completion of the evaluation process including required coordination, receipt or waiver of required state certifications, and completion of the appropriate environmental documents, an SOF will be prepared. In cases involving an EIS, a ROD will be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR part 230 and should be used in lieu of the SOF, providing the substantive parts of this section are included in the ROD. The SOF need not duplicate information contained in supporting environmental documents but rather may incorporate it by reference. The SOF should include a comprehensive summary and record of compliance and should be prepared in the following format except that the procedures of 33 CFR 325.2 should be followed for related activities of local interests.

    (a) The SOF should identify the name of the preparer, date (which may not necessarily correspond to the date signed), and name of waterway.

    (b) The proposed action for which the findings are made should be described.

    (c) A coordination section should be provided. The coordination section should reference the public notice number and date. The letters of comment and appropriate responses should be summarized. Any coordination undertaken by local or state agencies should also be discussed.

    (d) An environmental effects and impacts section should be used to document compliance with the applicable environmental laws. This section should include the views and/or conditions of the state concerning water quality certification and, if required, the results of the coastal zone consistency process.

    (e) A determinations section should reference the results of the EA and/or EIS and any conditions necessary to meet the state's water quality standards or coastal zone management program. Appropriate conditions or modifications should be included in the project specifications. This section should also contain a subsection on consideration of alternatives and cumulative impacts.

    (f) A section on the district engineer's findings and conclusions concerning the proposed project should be included.

    (g) The SOF should be dated and signed by the district engineer or his designee except in those cases requiring referral to higher authority.

    (h) In accordance with the provisions of section 104(g) of the ODA, the district engineer will forward a copy of the SOF to the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard, if the activity involves the ocean disposal of dredged material.

    (i) The Findings of No Significant Impact or ROD, as appropriate, required by 33 CFR part 230 may be incorporated into the SOF, as appropriate.

    § 337.7   Emergency actions.

#### § § 337.7

    After obtaining approval from the division engineer, the district engineer will respond to emergency situations on an expedited basis, complying with the procedures of this regulation to the maximum degree practicable. The district engineer will issue a public notice describing the emergency in accordance with § 337.1, if such a notice is practicable in view of the emergency situation; such a public notice should be forwarded to all appropriate Federal and state agencies. The district engineer should prepare a section 404(b)(1) evaluation report and, as necessary, an environmental assessment, if this is practicable in view of the emergency situation. If comments are received from the public notice which, in the judgment of the district engineer, reveal the necessity of modifying the emergency operation, the district engineer should take appropriate measures to modify the emergency operation to reduce, avoid, or minimize adverse environmental impacts. If the district engineer, after receiving comments from the public notice, determines that the emergency action would constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, he should, after consultation with the division engineer, coordinate with the Council on Environmental Quality about alternative arrangements for compliance with the NEPA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.11 to the extent that it is practicable in view of the emergency situation. District engineers should consult with the appropriate state officials to seek water quality certification or waiver of certification, and should certify that the Federal action is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with an approved coastal zone management plan for emergency activities, to the extent that is practicable in view of the emergency.

    § 337.8   Reports to higher echelons.

#### § § 337.8

    (a)  Such reports should be prepared in the format described in paragraph (b) of this section. Reports may be necessary in the following situations:

    (1) When there is substantial doubt as to the authority, law, regulations, or policies applicable to the Federal project;

    (2) When higher authority requests the case be forwarded for decision;

    (3) When the state does not concur in a coastal zone consistency determination or attempts to concur with conditions or controls;

    (4) When the state denies or unreasonably delays a water quality certification or issues the certification with conditions or controls not related to maintenance or enforcement of state water quality standards or significantly exceeding the Federal standard;

    (5) When the regional administrator has advised the district engineer, pursuant to section 404(c) of the CWA, of his intent to prohibit or restrict the use of a specified discharge site; or notifies the district engineer that the discharge of dredged material in ocean waters or territorial seas will not comply with the criteria and restrictions on the use of the site established under the ODA; and the district engineer determines that the proposed disposal cannot be reasonably modified to alleviate the regional administrator's objections; and

    (6) When the state fails to grant water quality certification or a waiver of certification or concurrence or waiver of coastal zone consistency for emergency actions.

    (b)  The report of the district engineer on a project requiring action by higher authority should be in letter form and contain the following information:

    (1) Justification showing the economic need for dredging.

    (2) The impact on states outside the project area if the project is not dredged.

    (3) The estimated cost of agency requirements which exceed those necessary in establishment of the Federal standard.

    (4) The relative urgency of dredging based on threat to national security, life or property.

    (5) Any other facts which will aid in determining whether to further defer the dredging and seek Congressional appropriations for the added expense or the need to exercise the authority of the Secretary of the Army to maintain navigation as provided by sections 511(a) and 404(t) of the CWA if the disagreement concerns water quality certification or other state permits.

    (6) If the disagreement concerns coastal zone consistency, the district engineer will follow the reporting requirement of this section and § 336.1(b)(9) of this chapter.

    § 337.9   Identification and use of disposal areas.

#### § § 337.9

    (a) District engineers should identify and develop dredged material disposal management strategies that satisfy the long-term (greater than 10 years) needs for Corps projects. Full consideration should be given to all practicable alternatives including upland, open water, beach nourishment, within banks disposal, ocean disposal, etc. Within existing policy, district engineers should also explore beneficial uses of dredged material, such as marsh establishment and dewatering techniques, in order to extend the useful life of existing disposal areas. Requests for water quality certification and/or coastal zone consistency concurrence for projects with identified long-term disposal sites should include the length of time for which the certification and/or consistency concurrence is sought. The section 404(b)(1) evaluation and environmental assessment or environmental impact statement should also address long-term maintenance dredging and disposal. District engineers should use the guidance at 40 CFR 230.80 to shorten environmental compliance processing time. The Corps of Engineers will be responsible for accomplishing or assuring environmental compliance requirements for all disposal areas. This does not preclude the adoption of other agencies NEPA documents in accordance with 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508.

    (b) The identification of disposal sites should include consideration of dredged material disposal needs by project beneficiaries. District engineers are encouraged to require local interests, where the project has a local sponsor, to designate long-term disposal areas.

    § 337.10   Supervision of Federal projects.

#### § § 337.10

    District engineers should assure that dredged or fill material disposal activities are conducted in conformance with current plans and description of the project as expressed in the SOF or ROD. Conditions and/or limitations required by a state (e.g., water quality certification), as identified through the coordination process, should be included in the project specifications. Contracting officers should assure that contractors are aware of their responsibilities for compliance with the terms and conditions of state certifications and other conditions expressed in the SOF or ROD.

  PART 338—OTHER CORPS ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF DREDGED MATERIAL OR FILL INTO WATERS OF THE U.S.

### Part 338

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1344.

    § 338.1   Purpose.

#### § § 338.1

    (a) The procedures of this part, in addition to the provisions of 33 CFR parts 335 through 337, should be followed when undertaking Corps operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of fill material into waters of the U.S., except that the procedures of part 336 of this chapter will be used in those cases where the discharge of fill material is also the discharge of dredged material, , beach nourishment, within banks disposal for erosion control, etc.

    (b) After construction of Corps Civil Works water resource projects, certain operations and maintenance activities involving the discharge of fill material require evaluation under the CWA. These activities generally include lakeshore management, installation of boat ramps, erosion protection along the banks of navigation channels, jetty maintenance, remedial erosion control, etc. While these activities are normally addressed in the existing environmental impact statement for the project, new technology or unexpected events such as storms or high waters may require maintenance or remedial work not fully addressed in existing environmental documents or state permits. In determining compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations the district engineer should use the CWA exemptions at 404(f) and NEPA categorical exclusions to the maximum extent practicable. If the district engineer decides that the changes have not been adequately addressed in existing environmental documentation, the procedures of this part should be followed.

    Subpart B—Program Goals and Responsibilities

      § 385.8   Goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

#### § § 385.8

      (a) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is a framework for modifications and operational changes to the Central and Southern Florida Project. The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.

      (b) The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and other non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, implement the Plan, as authorized by Congress, to ensure the protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida ecosystem and to achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan, and required pursuant to section 601 of WRDA 2000, for as long as the project is authorized.

      (c) The goal of the Plan is to restore, preserve, and protect the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region. The Plan is designed to accomplish this by providing the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water necessary to achieve and sustain those essential hydrological and biological characteristics that defined the undisturbed South Florida ecosystem. As authorized by Congress, the restored South Florida ecosystem will be significantly healthier than the current system; however it will not completely replicate the undisturbed South Florida ecosystem and some areas may more closely replicate the undisturbed ecosystem than others. Initial modeling showed that most of the water generated by the Plan would go to the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and the remainder of the water would go for use in the human environment. The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and other non-Federal sponsors shall ensure that Project Implementation Reports identify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be dedicated and managed for the natural system that is necessary to meet the restoration goals of the Plan. In accordance with the “Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement,” dated January 9, 2002 pursuant to section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000, the South Florida Water Management District or the Florida Department of Environmental Protection shall make sufficient reservations of water for the natural system under State law in accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that project and consistent with the Plan before water made available by a project is permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made unavailable.

      (d) The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall implement the Plan in a manner to continuously improve the expected performance level of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.

      § 385.9   Implementation principles.

#### § § 385.9

      The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and other non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct activities, including program-level activities, necessary to implement the Plan. Such activities shall be conducted as part of an integrated implementation program, in accordance with this part, and based on the following principles:

      (a) Individual projects shall be formulated, evaluated, and justified based on their ability to contribute to the goals and purposes of the Plan and on their ability to provide benefits that justify costs on a next-added increment basis.

      (b) Interim goals shall be established in accordance with § 385.38 to provide a means for evaluating restoration success of the Plan at specific time intervals during implementation. Interim targets to evaluate progress on providing for other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan shall be established in accordance with § 385.39. Interim goals and interim targets shall be consistent with each other.

      (c) Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration framework is not intended as a constraint on innovation during implementation through the adaptive management process. Continuous improvement of the Plan shall be sought to ensure that new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan. The adaptive management process provides a means for analyzing the performance of the Plan and assessing progress towards meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan as well as a basis for improving the performance of the Plan. Improving the performance of the Plan means enhancing the benefits of the Plan in terms of restoration of the natural system while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.

      § 385.10   Implementation responsibilities, consultation, and coordination.

#### § § 385.10

      (a)  Implementation of the Plan shall be the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsors.

      (b) —(1)  (i) In addition to any other applicable provision for consultation with Native American Tribes, including but not limited to, laws, regulations, executive orders, and policies the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall consult with and seek advice from the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida throughout the implementation process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials regarding programs and activities covered by this part. _Consultation_ with the tribes shall be conducted on a government-to-government basis.

      (ii) In carrying out their responsibilities under section 601 of WRDA 2000 with respect to the restoration of the South Florida ecosystem, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior shall fulfill any obligations to the Indian tribes in South Florida under the Indian trust doctrine as well as other applicable legal obligations.

      (2)  The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall consult with and seek advice from the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies throughout the implementation process to ensure meaningful and timely input by those agencies regarding programs and activities covered under this part. The time for, and extent of, consultation shall be appropriate for, and limited by, the activity involved.

      (c)  The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall coordinate implementation activities and the preparation of documents with other Federal, State, and local agencies and the tribes to fulfill the requirements of all applicable Federal and State laws, including but not limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act.

      (d)  Consultation involves reciprocal obligations: on the part of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor to involve agencies, tribes, and the public at an early stage and in such a way to ensure meaningful consultation, and on the part of the parties consulted to respond in a timely and meaningful fashion so that the implementation of the Plan is not jeopardized and so that delays do not result in other adverse consequences to restoration of the natural system, to the other goals and purposes of the Plan, or to the public interest generally. Prescribed time limits set by regulation are too inflexible for the entire consultation process. It is expected that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor will set reasonable time limits for consultation on specific decisions consistent with the purposes of this part and that the parties will consult in a timely and meaningful way. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor recognize that the time limits established for each specific decision will be proportionate to the complexity of the decision and will take into account the resources of the entity with whom the consultation is occurring in order to allow consultation to occur in a meaningful way. This part does not intend for a delay in consultation to be used as a de facto veto power. This part authorizes the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor to set reasonable limits on the amount of time for consultation. In setting reasonable time limits, the agencies and tribes may consider relevant considerations such as sequencing of projects, planning, contracting and funding, and any factor listed for setting time limits for consulting under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1501.8), including but not limited to, the nature and size of the proposed action, the degree to which relevant information is known or obtainable, the degree to which the action is controversial, the state of the art of analytical techniques, the number of persons affected, and the consequences of delay. In engaging in consultation, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsor shall inform the agencies, tribes, and public of the ending date for consultation. In addition, the agencies and tribes should adhere to all time limits imposed by law, regulations or executive order. In appropriate circumstances, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor may extend the time for consultation upon a showing that delays will not result in adverse consequences to the implementation of the Plan, to the restoration of the natural system, to the other goals and purposes of the Plan, or to the public interest and that relevant considerations justify a longer time. Failure of an agency, tribe or the public to engage in consultation with the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor, or file comments in, a timely and meaningful way shall not be a sufficient reason for extending a consultation or comment period. Nothing in this part is intended to alter existing time limits established by statute or other regulations.

      (e)  The Department of the Army recognizes the valuable role that the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (Task Force), its working group, and its other advisory bodies play in the discussion and resolution of issues related to the South Florida ecosystem. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District regularly brief the Task Force on the Plan and regularly serve on the working group and other advisory bodies. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and other non-Federal sponsors shall continue to provide information to, and consult with, the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, the Florida-based working group, and advisory bodies to the Task Force as appropriate throughout the implementation process for the Plan. In addition to consultation with the Task Force specified elsewhere in this part, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, its working group, and its advisory bodies, on other matters related to the implementation of the Plan, as the Task Force from time to time may request. Pursuant to the provisions of WRDA 1996, the Task Force shall provide general input concerning the implementation of the Plan. The Task Force shall provide recommendations to the Secretary of the Army regarding the implementation of the Plan, as provided in this part. The Secretary of the Army shall notify the Task Force to ensure it is afforded an opportunity to review and provide recommendations on reports and products, including but not limited to, interim goals and interim targets, Project Implementation Reports, Pilot Project Design Reports, Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, the pre-CERP baseline, assessment reports, guidance memoranda, Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports, periodic CERP updates, and reports to Congress prepared pursuant to § 385.40.

    Subpart C—CERP Implementation Processes

      § 385.11   Implementation process for projects.

#### § § 385.11

      Generally, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall develop and implement projects in accordance with the process that is shown in figure 1 in Appendix A of this part. Typical steps in this process involve:

      (a)  The Project Management Plan describes the activities, tasks, and responsibilities that will be used to produce and deliver the products necessary to implement the project.

      (b)  The Project Implementation Report provides information on plan formulation and evaluation, engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs, and environmental effects to bridge the gap between the conceptual design included in the Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction. The Project Implementation Reports will also set forth additional information and analyses necessary for the Secretary of the Army or Congress to approve the project for implementation.

      (c)  During this phase, final design of the project is completed and plans and specifications are prepared. Plans and specifications contain the information necessary to bid and construct the project.

      (d)  The lands, easements, and rights-of way, and relocations necessary for the project are acquired prior to construction.

      (e)  This phase is the actual construction of a project's components and includes an interim operation and monitoring period to ensure that the project operates as designed.

      (f)  After construction of the project has been completed, it is operated in accordance with the System Operating Manual and the Project Operating Manual.

      (g)  After the project has been constructed, monitoring is conducted as necessary to assess the effectiveness of the project and to provide information that will be used for the adaptive management program.

#### § § 385.13

      (a) To expedite implementation of the Plan, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors may implement projects under the authority of section 601(c) of WRDA 2000 that are described in the Plan and that will produce a substantial benefit to the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem.

      (b) Each project implemented under the authority of section 601(c) of WRDA 2000 shall:

      (1) In general, follow the process described in § 385.11;

      (2) Not be implemented until a Project Implementation Report is prepared and approved in accordance with § 385.26; and

      (3) Not exceed a total cost of $25,000,000.

      (c) The total aggregate cost of all projects implemented under the additional program authority shall not exceed $206,000,000.

      § 385.14   Incorporation of NEPA and related considerations into the implementation process.

#### § § 385.14

      (a)  (1) In implementing the Plan, the Corps of Engineers shall comply with the requirements of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4371, ) and applicable implementing regulations, including determining whether a specific action, when considered individually and cumulatively, will have a significant impact on the human environment.

      (2) As appropriate, other agencies shall be invited to be cooperating agencies in the preparation of NEPA documentation pursuant to § 230.16 of this chapter.

      (3) The District Engineer is the NEPA official responsible for compliance with NEPA for actions conducted to implement the Plan. Unless otherwise provided for by this part, NEPA coordination for implementation of the plan shall follow the NEPA procedures established in part 230 of this chapter.

      (b)  (1) In addition to the actions listed in § 230.6 of this chapter, actions normally requiring an EIS are:

      (i) Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports;

      (ii) System Operating Manual or significant changes to the System Operating Manual;

      (iii) Project Implementation Reports, including the draft Project Operating Manual when included in the Project Implementation Report;

      (iv) Pilot Project Design Reports, including the detailed operational testing and monitoring plan; and

      (v) Project Operating Manuals for any project where a Project Implementation Report is not prepared, or significant changes to Project Operating Manuals.

      (2) The District Engineer may consider the use of an environmental assessment (EA) on the types of actions described in this paragraph if early studies and coordination show that a particular action, considered individually and cumulatively, is not likely to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

      (c)  In addition to the actions listed in § 230.7 of this chapter, actions normally requiring an EA, but not necessarily an EIS, are modifications to Project Operating Manuals or the System Operating Manual, that do not provide for significant change in operation and/or maintenance.

      (d)  In addition to the activities listed in § 230.9 of this chapter, the following actions do not require separate NEPA documentation, either because, when considered individually and cumulatively, they do not have significant effects on the quality of the human environment or because any such effects will already have been considered in NEPA documentation prepared in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. However, the District Engineer should be alert for extraordinary circumstances that may dictate the need to prepare an EA or an EIS. Even though an EA or EIS is not indicated for a Federal action because of a “categorical exclusion,” that fact does not exempt the action from compliance with any other applicable Federal, State, or Tribal law, including but not limited to, the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

      (1) Project Cooperation Agreements;

Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall administer the 30-day state and agency review of the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report, and, as appropriate, file the Environmental Impact Statement with the Environmental Protection Agency.

      (6) After completion of the policy review and other requirements of law and policy, the Chief of Engineers shall submit the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report and the Chief of Engineers' recommendations to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.

      (7) The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall review the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report and shall, prior to submitting the Assistant Secretary's recommendations to Congress, coordinate the proposed recommendations with the Office of Management and Budget.

      (c)  The Plan requires a process for adaptive management and incorporation of new information. As a result of this process, minor adjustments in the Plan may be made through Project Implementation Reports. It is not the intent of this section to require a continual cycle of report writing for minor changes. Instead, the intent of this section is to develop a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report for changes to the Plan that would require a supplement to the programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District may, in their discretion, elect to prepare a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report for other changes.

      (c) The Corps of Engineers shall annually provide to the Office of Management and Budget an updated estimate of total cost of the Plan, the costs of individual project components, and an explanation of any changes in these estimates from the initial estimates contained in the “Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,” dated April 1, 1999.

    Subpart E—Ensuring Protection of the Natural System and Water Availability Consistent With the Goals and Purpose of the Plan

      § 385.35   Achievement of the benefits of the Plan.

#### § § 385.35

      (a)  (1) Not later than June 14, 2004 the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, develop for approval by the Secretary of the Army, the pre-CERP baseline to be used to aid the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District in determining if existing legal sources of water will be eliminated or transferred as a result of project implementation as described in § 385.36 and memorialize the pre-CERP baseline in an appropriate document. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in the development of the pre-CERP baseline.

      (i) The pre-CERP baseline may express the quantity, timing, and distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any other method which is based on the best available science.

      (ii) The pre-CERP baseline shall include appropriate documentation that includes a description of the assumptions used to develop the pre-CERP baseline.

      (iii) In addition to the development of the pre-CERP baseline, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall conduct other analyses that they deem necessary to determine if an existing legal source of water has been eliminated or transferred or if a new source of water is of comparable quality to that which has been eliminated or transferred in accordance with § 385.36.

      (2) In accordance with § 385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall provide opportunities for the public to review and comment on the pre-CERP baseline.

      (3) The pre-CERP baseline shall be developed with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. Within 180 days of being provided the pre-CERP baseline, or such shorter period that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may agree to, the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor shall provide the Secretary of the Army with a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence with the pre-CERP baseline. A failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence within such time frame shall be deemed as meeting the concurrency process of this section. A copy of any concurrency or non-concurrency statements shall be made a part of the administrative record and referenced in the final determination of the pre-CERP baseline. Any non-concurrency statement shall specifically detail the reason or reasons for the non-concurrence.

      (4) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, or shall it be interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any process of Florida law.

      (b)  (1) Initial modeling showed that most of the water generated by the Plan would go to the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and the remainder of the water would go for use in the human environment. The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and other non-Federal sponsors shall ensure that Project Implementation Reports identify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be dedicated and managed for the natural system that is necessary to meet the restoration goals of the Plan. In accordance with the “Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement,” dated January 9, 2002 pursuant to section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000, the South Florida Water Management District or the Florida Department of Environmental Protection shall make sufficient reservations of water for the natural system under State law in accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that project and consistent with the Plan before water made available by a project is permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made unavailable. In accordance with § 385.31(c), the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, determine the total quantity of water that is expected to be generated by implementation of the Plan, including the quantity expected to be generated for the natural system to attain restoration goals as well as the quantity expected to be generated for use in the human environment, and shall periodically update that estimate, as appropriate, based on new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, new or updated models, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.

      (2) Each Project Implementation Report shall take into account the availability of pre-CERP baseline water and previously reserved water as well as the estimated total quantity of water that is necessary for restoration for the natural system and the quantity of water anticipated to be made available from future projects in identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000.

      (3) Section 601(h)(3)(C)(i)(I) of WRDA 2000 requires the regulations of this part to establish a process for development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that ensure that the goals and objectives of the Plan are achieved. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) of WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) and (VI) of WRDA 2000. To implement these provisions and § 385.5, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with § 385.5 for approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. The guidance memorandum shall provide a process to be used in the preparation of Project Implementation Reports for identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system; determining the quantity, timing and distribution of water made available for other water-related needs of the region; determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered by the Plan meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii) of WRDA 2000.

      (i) The guidance memorandum shall generally be based on using a system-wide analysis of the water made available and may express the quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any other method which is based on the best available science. The guidance memorandum shall also provide for projects that are hydrologically separate from the rest of the system. The guidance memorandum also shall address procedures for determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards. These procedures shall ensure that any features to improve water quality are implemented in a manner consistent with the cost sharing provisions of WRDA 1996 and WRDA 2000.

      (ii) The guidance memorandum shall generally take into account the natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year based on an appropriate period of record; the objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to new sources; contingencies for drought protection; the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by a new project component while maintaining a system-wide perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan; and the need to determine whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered by the Plan meets applicable water quality standards.

      (iii) Project Implementation Reports approved before December 12, 2003 or before the development of the guidance memorandum may use whatever method that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor deem is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of section 601 of WRDA 2000.

      (iv) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, or shall it be interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any process of Florida law.

      (c)  The Project Implementation Report shall include a plan for operations of the project in the event that the project fails to provide the quantity, timing, or distribution of water described in the Project Implementation Report. Such plan shall take into account the specific authorized purposes of the project and the goals and purposes of the Plan and shall also provide for undertaking management actions in accordance with § 385.31(d).

      § 385.36   Elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water.

#### § § 385.36

      (a) Pursuant to the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000, Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred as a result of project implementation. If implementation of the project shall cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include an implementation plan that ensures that such elimination or transfer shall not occur until a new source of water of comparable quantity and quality is available to replace the water to be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall determine if implementation of the project will cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water by comparing the availability of water with the recommended project with the pre-CERP baseline developed in accordance with § 385.35(a), by using the water quality and other analyses developed in § 385.35(a)(1)(iii), and by using other appropriate information.

      (b) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with § 385.5 for approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, that describes the process for determining if existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred and for determining how and when a new source of water of comparable quantity and quality as that available on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 is available to replace the water to be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan. The guidance memorandum shall also describe the process for comparing the recommended project with the pre-CERP baseline to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred or eliminated as a result of project implementation. The guidance memorandum shall include a definition for existing legal sources of water for the purposes of determining if existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred. Existing legal sources of water shall include those for:

      (1) An agricultural or urban water supply;

      (2) Allocation or entitlement to the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida under section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e);

      (3) The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida;

      (4) Water supply for Everglades National Park; and

      (5) Water supply for fish and wildlife.

      (c) Until guidance is issued, issues involving existing legal sources of water should be resolved on a case-by-case basis considering all factors that can be identified as relevant to decisions under the savings clause.

      § 385.37   Flood protection.

#### § § 385.37

      (a)  In accordance with section 601 of WRDA 2000, flood protection, consistent with restoration, preservation, and protection of the natural system, is a purpose of the Plan.

      (b)  Each Project Implementation Report shall include appropriate analyses, and consider the operational conditions included in the pre-CERP baseline developed pursuant to § 385.35(a), to demonstrate that the levels of service for flood protection that:

      (1) Were in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of WRDA 2000; and

      (2) Are in accordance with applicable law, will not be reduced by implementation of the project.

      (c)  The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida Ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. As appropriate, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall consider opportunities to provide additional flood protection, consistent with restoration of the natural system, and the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and other applicable laws.

      § 385.38   Interim goals.

#### § § 385.38

      (a)  (1) The Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall, not later than December 13, 2004, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, execute an Interim Goals Agreement establishing interim goals to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and assessment so as to achieve the overarching objectives of the Plan and to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated, and ultimately reported to Congress in accordance with § 385.40 throughout the implementation process.

      (2) After execution of the Interim Goals Agreement, the Department of the Army shall memorialize the agreement in appropriate Corps of Engineers guidance.

      (b)  (1) Interim goals are a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated at specific points by agency managers, the State, and Congress throughout the overall planning and implementation process. In addition, interim goals will facilitate adaptive management and allow the Corps of Engineers and its non-Federal sponsors opportunities to make adjustments if actual project performance is less than anticipated, including recommending changes to the Plan. Interim goals are not standards or schedules enforceable in court.

      (2) The interim goals shall:

      (i) Facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring and assessment;

      (ii) Be provided to the independent scientific review panel established in accordance with § 385.22(a);

      (iii) Be considered in developing the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, Project Implementation Reports, and Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; and

      (iv) Be considered in making budgetary decisions concerning implementation of the Plan.

      (3) To ensure flexibility in implementing the Plan over the next several decades, and to ensure that interim goals may reflect changed circumstances or new information resulting from adaptive management, the interim goals may be modified, consistent with the processes set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, to reflect new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.

      (4) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall sequence and schedule projects as appropriate to achieve the interim goals and the interim targets established pursuant to § 385.39 to the extent practical given funding, technical, or other constraints.

      (5) If the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall determine why the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be met and either:

      (i) Initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to § 385.31(d) to achieve the interim goals as soon as practical, consistent with the purposes of the Plan and consistent with the interim targets established pursuant to § 385.39; or

      (ii) Recommend changes to the interim goals in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (c)  (1) RECOVER, using best available science and information, shall recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of the Plan, consisting of regional hydrologic performance targets, improvements in water quality, and anticipated ecological responses for areas such as, Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River Region, the Water Conservation Areas, the Lower East Coast, the Upper East Coast, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and the Caloosahatchee River, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and other estuaries and nearshore areas. These interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water for the natural system provided by the Plan in five-year increments that begin in 2005, with the goals reflecting the results expected to be achieved by 2010 and for each five-year increment thereafter. The interim goals shall be developed through the use of appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation. In developing the interim goals for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting performance at a given time. RECOVER may recommend additional interim goals in addition to those initially developed and may propose revisions to the initial set of interim goals as new information is gained through adaptive management. Interim goals shall include incremental improvements in the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water anticipated to be required to meet long-term hydrological and ecological restoration goals, based on best available science. These goals may be modified, based on best available science and the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER shall consider indicators including, but not limited to:

      (i) Hydrologic indicators, including:

      (A) The amount of water, in addition to the pre-CERP baseline and assumptions regarding without project conditions, which will be available to the natural system;

      (B) Hydroperiod targets in designated sample areas throughout the Everglades;

      (C) The changes in the seasonal and annual overland flow volumes in the Everglades that will be available to the natural system;

      (D) The frequency of extreme high and low water levels in Lake Okeechobee; and

      (E) The frequency of meeting salinity envelopes in estuaries such as the St. Lucie, Caloosahatchee, Biscayne Bay, and Florida Bay and nearshore areas.

      (ii) Improvement in water quality; including:

      (A) Total phosphorus concentrations in the Everglades; and

      (B) Lake Okeechobee phosphorus concentrations.

      (iii) Ecological responses, including:

      (A) Increases in total spatial extent of restored wetlands;

      (B) Improvement in habitat quality; and

      (C) Improvement in native plant and animal abundance.

      (3) In developing the interim goals based upon water quality and expected ecological responses, the Corps of Engineers, The Department of the Interior, and the South Florida Water Management District shall take into consideration the extent to which actions undertaken by Federal, State, tribal, and other entities under programs not within the scope of this part may affect achievement of the goals.

      (d)  (1) The recommendations of RECOVER shall be provided to the Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior, and the South Florida Water Management District. These recommendations shall be provided no later than June 14, 2004. The proposed Interim Goals Agreement shall be developed by the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Commerce, other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. In considering the interim goals to be included in the Interim Goals Agreement, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, shall be provided with, and consider, the technical recommendations of RECOVER and any modifications to those recommendations by the Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior, or the South Florida Water Management District. The Secretary of the Army shall provide a notice of availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the  and seek public comments.

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may offer credit assistance in excess of 49% of the reasonably anticipated eligible project costs as long as such excess assistance combined for all projects does not require greater than 25% of the subsidy amount made available for the fiscal year, per 33 U.S.C. 3912(d).

    (1) Use of the authority to offer credit assistance in excess of 49% of the anticipated eligible project costs shall be considered on a case by case basis.

    (2) In the event this authority is used, all other criteria and requirements described in this part must be met and adhered to.

    (c) For each project receiving credit assistance, total Federal assistance may not exceed 80% of the total project costs, except for certain rural water projects authorized to be carried out by the Secretary of the Interior that includes among its beneficiaries a federally recognized Indian Tribe and for which the authorized Federal share of the total project costs is greater than 80%, and in accordance with 85 FR 39189 ( division D of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub.

    (d) Proceeds from the credit assistance shall not be utilized to provide cash contributions to the Corps for project related costs, except for such fees as allowed by 33 U.S.C. 3908(b)(7), limited to the application, transaction processing, and servicing fees as described in § 386.15.

    (e) Costs incurred, and the value of any integral in-kind contributions made, before receipt of credit assistance may be considered in calculating eligible project costs only upon approval of the Secretary. Such costs and integral in-kind contributions must be directly related to the development or execution of the project and must be eligible project costs as defined in § 386.2. In addition, such costs, excluding the value of any integral in-kind contributions, are payable from the proceeds of the Federal credit instrument and shall be considered incurred costs for purposes of paragraph (h) of this section. Capitalized interest on the Federal credit instrument is not eligible for calculating eligible project costs.

    (f) No costs financed internally or with interim funding may be refinanced under this part later than a year following substantial completion of the project.

    (g) The Secretary shall not obligate funds in the form of a loan or loan guarantee for a project prior to:

    (1) To issuance of a determination that the Federal action is eligible for a Categorical Exclusion:

    (2) Issuance of a Finding of No Significant Impact; or

    (3) Issuance of a Record of Decision under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321

    (h) The Secretary shall fund a secured loan based on the project's financing needs. The credit agreement shall include the anticipated schedule for such loan disbursements. Actual disbursements will be based on incurred costs, and in accordance with the approved construction plan, as evidenced by invoices or other documentation acceptable to the Secretary.

    (i) The interest rate on a secured loan will be equal to or greater than the yield on U.S. Treasury securities of comparable maturity on the date of execution of the credit agreement as identified through use of the daily rate tables published by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for the State and Local Government Series (SLGS) investments. The yield on comparable Treasury securities will be estimated by adding one basis point to the SLGS daily rate with a maturity that is closest to the weighted average loan life of the Federal credit instrument, per 33 U.S.C. 3908(b)(4).

    (j) The final maturity date of a secured loan will be the earlier of the date that is 35 years after the date of substantial completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary and identified in the credit agreement, or if the useful life of the project, as determined by the Secretary, is less than 35 years, the useful life of the project; however, the final maturity date of a secured loan to a State infrastructure financing authority will be not later than 35 years after the date on which amounts are first disbursed. In determining the useful life of the project, for the purposes of establishing the final maturity date of the Federal credit instrument, the Secretary will consider the useful economic life of the asset(s) being financed.

    (k) A secured loan will not be subordinated to the claims of any holder of project obligations in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation of the borrower of the project (33 U.S.C. 3908(b)(6)).

    (l) The Corps will establish a repayment schedule for a secured loan or loan guarantee based on the projected cash flow from project revenues and other repayment sources. Scheduled loan or loan guarantee repayments of principal and interest on a secured loan or loan guarantee will commence not later than 5 years after the projected date of substantial completion of the project at the time of execution of the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement, as determined by the Secretary (33 U.S.C. 3908(c)(A)); however, scheduled loan or loan guarantee repayments of principal and interest on a secured loan to a State infrastructure financing authority will commence not later than 5 years after the date on which amounts are first disbursed. The final maturity of the credit agreement shall be in no instance later than 35 years after the projected date of substantial completion of the project at the time of execution of the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement.

    § 386.4   Application process.

#### § § 386.4

    (a) Each fiscal year for which budget authority is made available by Congress, the Corps shall publish a solicitation to announce the availability of credit assistance. It will specify how to electronically submit a preliminary application, the estimated amount of funding available to support Federal credit instruments, contact name(s), and other details for submissions and funding approvals.

    (b) Prospective borrowers seeking credit assistance under this part will be required to follow an application process requiring submission of the preliminary application as designated in the solicitation to announce the availability of credit assistance. In addition, the extent to which the project financing plan includes any other form of Federal assistance (including grants), in addition to WIFIA credit assistance, will be required to be provided in the application.

    (c) Following approval of the term sheet, and/or negotiation of satisfactory terms and conditions of the Federal credit instrument, the prospective borrower will proceed to closing, as described in § 386.13.

#### § § 386.6

    (a) In making WIFIA funding decisions under this part, the Corps will follow the requirements of Executive Order (E.O.) 11988, as amended by E.O. 13690, and Engineering Regulation (ER) 1165-2-26, “Implementation of E.O. 11988 on Floodplain Management”. Applicants shall submit information regarding the project that is sufficient for the Corps to determine that the project is in compliance with the requirements of E.O. 11988 and ER 1165-2-26.

    (b) Projects funded under this part will meet or exceed applicable State, local, Tribal, and territorial standards for flood risk and floodplain management, as well as E.O. 11988.

    (c) All projects under this part are considered Federal actions under E.O. 11988 and thus, project applicants shall determine whether the proposed project will occur in the floodplain. If the project is located within the floodplain, the applicant must determine whether the action is critical or not and what floodplain standard to follow. The Corps will implement the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS), where appropriate, which is a flood standard established by E.O. 13690, that aims to build a more resilient future through the encouragement of consideration of current and future risk when Federal investments are used to build or rebuild near floodplains. The Corps will ensure unwise uses are avoided, where possible, including the increase or transfer of flood risks, resulting in adverse impacts to human health, safety, welfare, property, natural resources, or functions of floodplains. Further guidance on implementation of E.O. 11988 can be found in the Corps ER 1165-2-26 (30 March 1984). Further information on FFRMS can be found at

    § 386.7   American iron and steel.

#### § § 386.7

    (a) All projects receiving credit assistance under this part for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a project shall use only iron and steel products produced in the United States, unless waiver of the requirement in this paragraph (a) is granted by an official authorized to do so.

    (b) Consistent with 33 U.S.C. 3914(b), “iron and steel products” means the following products made primarily of iron or steel: lined or unlined pipes and fittings, manhole covers and other municipal castings, hydrants, tanks, flanges, pipe clamps and restraints, valves, structural steel, reinforced precast concrete and construction materials. Equipment employed in construction that does not become part of the project is not an “iron and steel product” for the purpose of this section.

    § 386.8   Labor standards.

#### § § 386.8

    All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects receiving credit assistance under this part shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing for the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor.

    § 386.9   Investment-grade ratings.

#### § § 386.9

    (a) At the time a prospective borrower submits an application, the Corps shall require a preliminary rating opinion letter. The letter is a conditional credit assessment from a NRSRO that provides a preliminary indication of the project's overall creditworthiness and that specifically addresses the potential of the project's senior debt obligations, which may include, or be limited to, the Federal credit instrument to achieve an investment-grade rating, and address the rating of obligations similar to those proposed for the Federal credit instrument when the Federal credit instrument is not a senior debt obligation. The requirement of this paragraph (a) may be met, on a case-by-case basis, by accepting a recent credit rating of obligations that have a lien on the revenues pledged for repayment. This rating should be based on an unenhanced analysis of the underlying pledged source of repayment and not give any credit to any prospective loan guarantee provided by the U.S. Government.

    (b) Consistent with 33 U.S.C. 3907(a)(D)(ii), the full funding of a Federal credit instrument shall be contingent on:

    (1) The assignment of investment-grade ratings by NRSROs to all project obligations that have a lien on the pledged security senior to that of the Federal credit instrument on the pledged security; or

    (2)(i) In the event that the Federal credit instrument is:

    (A) A senior debt obligation;

    (B) Pari passu with the senior project obligations; or

    (C) A general obligation of the prospective borrower, to the Federal credit instrument.

    (ii) The applicant must provide at least one final rating opinion letter which provides a credit rating on the direct loan or the unenhanced Federal credit instrument. This rating should be based on an unenhanced analysis of the underlying pledged source of repayment and not give any credit to the loan or loan guarantee provided by the U.S. Government.

    (c) Neither the preliminary rating opinion letter nor the final ratings should reflect the effect of bond insurance, unless that insurance provides credit enhancement that secures WIFIA obligation.

    § 386.10   Threshold criteria.

#### § § 386.10

    (a) To be eligible to receive Federal credit assistance under this part, a project shall meet the following threshold criteria:

    (1) The project and prospective borrower shall be creditworthy.

    (2) A project shall have eligible project costs that are reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed $20 million.

    (3) A Federal credit instrument:

    (i) Shall be repayable, in whole or in part, from State or local taxes, user fees, or other dedicated revenue sources that also secure the senior project obligations of the project;

    (ii) Shall include a rate covenant, coverage requirement, or similar security feature supporting the project obligations; and

    (iii) May have a lien on revenues subject to any lien securing project obligations.

    (4) In the case of a project that is undertaken by an entity that is not a State or local government or an agency or instrumentality of a State or local government, or a Tribal government or consortium of Tribal governments, the project that the entity is undertaking shall be publicly sponsored.

    (5) The prospective borrower shall have developed an operations and maintenance plan that identifies adequate revenues to operate, maintain, and repair the project during its useful life. If the borrower is a State infrastructure financing authority, it shall have ensured and will ensure that its borrowers have a plan for the eligible projects they are undertaking that identifies adequate revenues to operate, maintain and repair such projects during the useful life of such projects. The requirement in this paragraph (a)(5) may be met through the development of a written plan or a financial model.

    (b) With respect to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary may accept general obligation pledges or general corporate promissory pledges and will determine the acceptability of other pledges and forms of collateral as dedicated revenue sources on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary shall not accept a pledge of Federal funds, regardless of source, as security for the Federal credit instrument.

    (c) The provision at 33 U.S.C. 3907(c) provides that nothing in section 3907(c) (which includes eligibility requirements and selection criteria for projects and entities receiving WIFIA assistance) is intended to supersede the applicability of other requirements of Federal law, including regulations.

    § 386.11   Selection criteria.

#### § § 386.11

    The selection criteria in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section will be used for evaluating and selecting among eligible projects to receive credit assistance:

    (1) The reduction of flood risk;

    (2) The improvement of water quality and quantity, including aquifer recharge;

    (3) The protection of drinking water, including source water protection;

    (4) The support of domestic and international commerce; and

    (b) The extent to which the project financing plan includes public or private financing, in addition to WIFIA credit assistance.

    (c) The likelihood that WIFIA credit assistance would enable the project to proceed at an earlier date than the project would otherwise be able or likely to proceed.

    (d) The extent to which the project uses new or innovative approaches.

    (e) The amount of budget authority required to fund the WIFIA Federal credit instrument.

    (f) The extent to which the project—

    (2) Helps maintain or protect the environment.

    (g) The extent to which a project serves regions with significant clean energy exploration development, or production areas.

    (h) The extent to which a project serves regions with significant water resource challenges, including the need to address—

    (1) Water quality concerns in areas of regional, national, or international significance;

    (2) Water quantity concerns related to groundwater, surface water, or other water sources;

    (3) Significant flood risk;

    (i) The extent to which the project addresses identified municipal, State, or regional priorities.

    (j) The readiness of the project to proceed toward development, including a demonstration by the obligor that there is a reasonable expectation that the contracting process for construction of the project can commence not later than 90 days after the date on which a Federal credit instrument is obligated for the project under WIFIA.

    (k) The extent to which WIFIA credit assistance reduces the overall Federal contributions to the project.

    (l) The extent to which the project serves economically disadvantaged communities and spurs economic opportunity for, and minimally adversely impacts, economically disadvantaged communities and their populations.

    § 386.12   Term sheets and approvals.

#### § § 386.12

    (a) The Corps, after review and evaluation of an application, and all other required documents submitted by a prospective borrower, may offer to such prospective borrower a written term sheet and/or a credit agreement, including detailed terms and conditions that must be met.

    (b) The issuance of a term sheet, upon execution by the Secretary, does not constitute a commitment by the Secretary to enter into the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement. Execution of the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement represents obligation by the Secretary.

    § 386.13   Closing on the Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement.

#### § § 386.13

    (a) Only a Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement executed by the Secretary can obligate the Corps to issue a loan or loan guarantee. The Corps is not bound by oral representations. Each Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement shall contain the following requirements and conditions, and shall not be executed until the Corps determines that the following requirements and conditions are satisfied:

    (1) Except if explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress, no Federal funds, proceeds of Federal loans, or proceeds of loans guaranteed by the Federal Government may be used by a borrower to pay for credit subsidy costs, administrative fees, or other fees charged by or paid to the Corps relating to the WIFIA program; however, proceeds of the Federal credit instrument may be used to pay for such administrative or other fees but may not be used to pay an “Optional Credit Subsidy Fee”.

    (2) At closing, the Corps will ensure that the following requirements and conditions are or will be satisfied pursuant to the credit agreement or otherwise:

    (i) The project qualifies as an eligible project under WIFIA;

    (ii) The face value of the credit agreement is limited to no more than 49 percent of reasonably anticipated eligible project costs, or if credit assistance in excess of 49 percent has been approved, no more than the percentage of eligible project costs agreed upon, not to exceed 80 percent of total project costs;

    (iii) If the credit instrument is a loan guarantee, the loan guarantee does not finance, either directly or indirectly, tax exempt debt obligations, consistent with the requirements of section 149(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;

    (iv) The amount of the credit agreement, when combined with other funds, will be sufficient to carry out the project, including adequate contingency funds;

    (v) The borrower is pledging collateral and/or providing a general obligation pledge, determined by the Corps to be necessary to secure the repayment of the credit agreement;

    (vi) The credit agreement and related documents include detailed terms and conditions necessary and appropriate to protect the interest of the United States in the case of default;

    (vii) There is satisfactory evidence that the applicant is willing, competent, and capable of performing the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, and will diligently pursue the project;

    (viii) The applicant has taken and is obligated to continue to take those actions necessary to perfect and maintain liens on assets which are pledged as security for the credit agreement, as allowed under State or local law;

    (ix) The Corps or its representatives have access to the project site at all reasonable times in order to monitor the performance of the project;

    (x) The Corps and the applicant agree as to the information that will be made available to the Corps and the information that will be made publicly available;

    (xii) The applicant has no delinquent Federal debt, including tax liabilities, unless the delinquency has been resolved with the appropriate Federal agency in accordance with the standards of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996;

    (xiii) Loan proceeds provided under the agreement shall not be utilized by the applicant to provide cash contributions to the Corps for project related costs, except for such fees as allowed by 33 U.S.C. 3908(b)(7), limited to the application, transaction processing, and servicing fees as described in § 386.15;

    (xiv) Costs incurred with loan proceeds under the agreement shall not be eligible for reimbursement or for the transfer of credit toward the non-Federal cost share of another federally authorized project;

    (xv) The credit agreement and related agreements contain such other terms and conditions as the Corps deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States, including without limitation provisions for:

    (A) Such collateral and other credit support for the credit agreement; and

    (B) Such collateral sharing, priorities and voting rights among creditors and other intercreditor arrangements as, in each case, the Corps deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States; and

    (3) The credit agreement must contain audit provisions which provide, in substance, as follows:

    (i) The applicant must keep such records concerning the project as are necessary to facilitate an effective and accurate audit and performance evaluation of the project; and

    (ii) The Corps and the Inspector General, or their duly authorized representatives, must have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the applicant. Examination of records may be made during the regular business hours of the applicant, or at any other time mutually convenient.

    (4) OMB has reviewed and approved the Corps calculation of the Credit Subsidy Cost of the Loan or Loan Guarantee.

By the closing date, the prospective borrower must have satisfied all of the detailed terms and conditions required by the Corps and all other contractual, statutory, and regulatory requirements. In addition, the prospective borrower must have provided at least one final rating opinion letter which provides a credit rating on the final negotiated direct loan or Loan Guarantee Agreement that does not take into account the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The prospective borrower must submit this final credit rating letter to the Corps prior to closing. If the prospective borrower has not satisfied all such terms and conditions by the closing date, the Secretary may set a new closing date or reject the application.

    (c) The execution of a Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee shall represent approval of the application for credit assistance and shall represent the legal obligation of budget authority.

    § 386.14   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 386.14

    The borrower will provide annual audited financial statements, a public benefits report, and other reports to the Corps in the form and manner agreed upon in the credit agreement. These other reports may include, but are not limited to, an updated financial model and construction reports. The Corps may conduct periodic financial and compliance reviews or audits of the borrower and its project, as determined necessary by the Corps.

    § 386.15   Fees.

#### § § 386.15

    (a)  The Corps will require a non-refundable application fee for each project applying for credit assistance under the WIFIA program. The application fee will be due upon submission of the application. For public applicants with projects serving small communities or economically disadvantaged communities, the total application fee will be $0. For all other applications, the total application fee will be $25,000. The total application fee will be credited to the transaction processing fee required under paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the Corps will require an additional transaction processing fee for projects selected to receive WIFIA assistance upon closing, or if the project does not proceed to closing,  if the application is withdrawn or denied. The proceeds of any such fees will be used to pay the remaining portion of the Corps' cost of providing credit assistance and the costs of conducting engineering reviews and retaining expert firms, including financial and legal services, to assist in the underwriting of the Federal Credit instrument.

    (c)  The Corps will require borrowers to pay a servicing fee for each credit instrument approved for funding. Separate fees may apply for each type of credit instrument ( a secured loan with a single disbursement, or a secured loan with multiple disbursements), depending upon the costs of servicing the credit instrument as determined by the Secretary. Such fees will be set at a level sufficient to enable the Corps to recover all or a portion of the costs to the Federal Government of servicing WIFIA credit instruments.

    (d)  If, in any given year, there is insufficient budget authority to fund the credit instrument for a qualified project that has been selected to receive assistance under WIFIA, the Corps and the approved applicant may agree upon a supplemental fee to be paid by or on behalf of the approved applicant at the time of execution of the term sheet to reduce the subsidy cost of that project. No such fee may be included among eligible project costs.

    (e)  To the extent that Congress appropriates funds in any given year beyond those needed to cover internal administrative costs, the Corps may utilize such appropriated funds to reduce fees for a State or local governmental entity, agency, or instrumentality, a Tribal government or consortium of Tribal governments that would otherwise be charged under paragraph (c) of this section.

    (f)  The Corps may require payment in full by the borrower of additional fees, in an amount determined by the Corps, and of related fees and expenses of its independent consultants and outside counsel, to the extent that such fees and expenses are incurred by or on behalf of the Corps and to the extent such third parties are not paid directly by the borrower, in the event the borrower experiences difficultly relating to technical, financial, or legal matters or other events ( engineering failure or financial workouts) which require the Corps to incur time or expenses beyond standard monitoring. No such fee may be included among eligible project costs.
