#### § § 1624.5

    (a) Immediately upon determining which persons are to be ordered for induction, the Director of Selective Service shall issue to each person selected an Order to Report for Induction. The order will be sent to the current address most recently provided by the registrant to the Selective Service System. The date specified to report for induction shall be at least 10 days after the date on which the Order to Report for Induction is issued. The filing of a claim for reclassification in accord with § 1633.2 of this chapter delays the date the registrant is required to report for induction until not earlier than the tenth day after the claim is determined to have been abandoned or is finally determined is finally determined in accord with the provisions of this chapter. A claim is finally determined when the registrant does not have the right to appeal the last classification action with respect to the claim or he fails to exercise his right to appeal.

    (b) Any person who has been ordered for induction who is distant from the address to which the order was sent must either report at the time and place specified in the order, or voluntarily submit himself for induction processing at another MEPS on or before the day that he was required to report in accordance with his induction order.

Such order will be deemed only to be an order to produce evidence of his status. When an alien registrant has been within the United States for two or more periods (including periods before his registration) and the total of such periods equals one year, he shall be deemed to have resided in the United States for one year. In computing the length of such periods, any portion of one day shall be counted as a day. Upon establishing a one year residency, the alien registrant will be assigned to the age selection group corresponding to his age.

    (4) The registrant has been accepted as a ROTC scholarship student in the next succeeding ROTC program at a college or university.

    (g) The Director of Selective Service shall issue to each registrant whose induction is postponed a written notice thereof.

    (h) No registrant whose induction has been postponed shall be inducted into the Armed Forces during the period of any such postponement. A postponement of induction shall not render invalid the Order to Report for Induction which has been issued to the registrant, but shall operate only to postpone the reporting date, and the registrant shall report on the new date scheduled without having issued to him a new Order to Report for Induction.

    (i) Any registrant receiving a postponement under the provisions of this section, shall, after the expiration of such postponement, be rescheduled to report for induction at the place to which he was originally ordered.

    (j) The initial determination of claims for all postponements is made by area office compensated personnel. After a denial of a claim for a student postponement, the registrant may request the local board to consider the claim. Such registrant shall be afforded an opportunity to appeal before the board in accord with the procedures of §§ 1648.4 and 1648.5.

    (b) Whose stated objection to participation in war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle, but instead rests solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, expediency, or his own self-interest or well-being; or

    (c) Whose objection to participation in war is directed against a particular war rather than against war in any form (a selective objection). If a registrant objects to war in any form, but also believes in a theocratic, spiritual war between the forces of good and evil, he may not by reason of that belief alone be considered a selective conscientious objector.

    § 1636.6   Analysis of belief.

#### § § 1636.6

    (a) A registrant claiming conscientious objection is not required to be a member of a  or any other church, religious organization, or religious sect to qualify for a 1-A-0 or 1-0 classification; nor is it necessary that he be affiliated with any particular group opposed to participation in war in any form.

    (b) The registrant who identifies his beliefs with those of a traditional church or religious organization must show that he basic_all_y adheres to beliefs of that church or religious organization whether or not he is actually affiliated with the institution whose teachings he claims as the basis of his conscientious objection. He need not adhere to  beliefs of that church or religious organization.

    (c) A registrant whose beliefs are not religious in the traditional sense, but are based primarily on moral or ethical principle should hold such beliefs with the same strength or conviction as the belief in a Supreme Being is held by a person who is religious in the traditional sense. Beliefs may be mixed; they may be a combination of traditional religious beliefs and nontraditional religious, moral or ethical beliefs. The registrant's beliefs must play a significant role in his life but should be evaluated only insofar as they pertain to his stated objection to his participation in war.

    (d) Where the registrant is or has been a member of a church, religious organization, or religious sect, and where his claim of a conscientious objection is related to such membership, the board may properly inquire as to the registrant's membership, the religious teachings of the church, religious organization, or religious sect, and the registrant's religious activity, insofar as each relates to his objection to participation in war. The fact that the registrant may disagree with or not subscribe to some of the tenets of his church or religious sect does not necessarily discredit his claim.

    (e)(1) The history of the process by which the registrant acquired his beliefs, whether founded on religious, moral, or ethical principle is relevant to the determination whether his stated opposition to participation in war in any form is sincere.

    (2) The registrant must demonstrate that his religious, ethical, or moral convictions were acquired through training, study, contemplation, or other activity comparable to the processes by which traditional religious convictions are formulated. He must show that these religious, moral, or ethical convictions, once acquired, have directed his life in the way traditional religious convictions of equal strength, depth, and duration have directed the lives of those whose beliefs are clearly founded in traditional religious conviction.

    (f) The registrant need not use formal or traditional language in describing the religious, moral, or ethical nature of his beliefs. Board members are not free to reject beliefs because they find them incomprehensible or inconsistent with their own beliefs.

    (g) Conscientious objection to participation in war in any form, if based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, may not be deemed disqualifying simply because those beliefs may influence the registrant concerning the Nation's domestic or foreign policy.

    § 1636.7   Impartiality.

#### § § 1636.7

    Boards may not give preferential treatment to one religion over another, and all beliefs whether of a religious, ethical, or moral nature are to be given equal consideration.

    § 1636.8   Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for classification as a conscientious objector.

#### § § 1636.8

    (a) After the registrant has submitted a claim for classification as a conscientious objector and his file is complete, a determination of his sincerity will be made based on:

    (1) All documents in the registrant's file folder; and

    (2) The oral statements of the registrant at his personal appearance(s) before the local and/or appeal board; and

    (3) The oral statements of the registrant's witnesses, if any, at his personal appearance(s) before the local board; and

    (4) The registrant's general demeanor during his personal appearance(s).

    (b) The registrant's stated convictions should be a matter of conscience.

    (c) The board should be convinced that the registrant's personal history since the crystallization of his conscientious objection is not inconsistent with his claim and demonstrates that the registrant's objection is not solely a matter of expediency. A recent crystallization of beliefs does not in itself indicate expediency.

    (d) The information presented by the registrant should reflect a pattern of behavior in response to war and weapons which is consistent with his stated beliefs. Instances of violent acts or conviction for crimes of violence, or employment in the development or manufacturing of weapons of war, if the claim is based upon or supported by a life of nonviolence, may be indicative of inconsistent conduct.

    (e) The development of a registrant's opposition to war in any form may bear on his sincerity. If the registrant claims a recent crystallization of beliefs, his claim should be supported by evidence of a religious or educational experience, a traumatic event, an historical occasion, or some other special situation which explains when and how his objection to participation in war crystallized.

    (f) In the event that a registrant has previously worked in the development of or manufacturing of weapons of war or has served as a member of a military reserve unit, it should be determined whether such activity was prior to the stated crystallization of the registrant's conscientious objector beliefs. Inconsistent conduct prior to the actual crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs is not necessarily indicative of insincerity. But, inconsistent conduct subsequent to such crystallization may indicate that registrant's stated objection is not sincere.

    (g) A registrant's behavior during his personal appearance before a board may be relevant to the sincerity of his claim.

    (1) Evasive answers to questions by board members or the use of hostile, belligerent, or threatening words or actions, for example, may in proper circumstances be deemed inconsistent with a claim in which the registrant bases his objection on a belief in nonviolence.

    (2) Care should be exercised that nervous, frightened, or apprehensive behavior at the personal appearance is not misconstrued as a reflection of insincerity.

    (h) Oral response to questions posed by board members should be consistent with the written statements of the registrant and should generally substantiate the submitted information in the registrant's file folder; any inconsistent material should be explained by the registrant. It is important to recognize that the registrant need not be eloquent in his answers. But, a clear inconsistency between the registrant's oral remarks at his personal appearance and his written submission to the board may be adequate grounds, if not satisfactorily explained, for concluding that his claim is insincere.

    (i) The registrant may submit letters of reference and other supporting statements of friends, relatives and acquaintances to corroborate the sincerity of his claim, although such supplemental documentation is not essential to approval of his claim. A finding of insincerity based on these letters or supporting statements must be carefully explained in the board's decision, specific mention being made of the particular material relied upon for denial of classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0.

> [47 FR 4655, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987; 60 FR 13908, Mar. 15, 1995]

    § 1636.9   Types of decisions.

#### § § 1636.9

    The following are the types of decisions which may be made by a board when a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 has been considered.

    (a) Decision to grant a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0, as requested, based on a determination that the truth or sincerity of the registrant's claim is not refuted by any information contained in the registrant's file or obtained during his personal appearance.

    (b) Decision to deny a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 based on all information before the board, and a finding that such information fails to meet the tests specified in § 1636.3 or 1636.4 of this part. If supported by information contained in the registrant's file or obtained during his personal appearance the board may find that the facts presented by the registrant in support of his claim are untrue.

    § 1636.10   Statement of reasons for denial.

#### § § 1636.10

    (a) Denial of a conscientious objector claim by a board must be accompanied by a statement specifying the reason(s) for such denial as prescribed in §§ 1633.9, 1651.4 and 1653.3 of this chapter. The reason(s) must, in turn, be supported by evidence in the registrant's file.

    (b) If a board's denial is based on statements by the registrant or on a determination that the claim is inconsistent or insincere, this should be fully explained in the statement of reasons accompanying the denial.

    (5) The term  includes but is not limited to financial assistance.

    (6) Hardship is the unreasonable deprivation of a dependent of the financial assistance, personal care or companionship furnished by the registrant when that deprivation would be caused by the registrant's induction.

    § 1642.2   The claim for classification in Class 3-A.

#### § § 1642.2

    A claim for classification in Class 3-A must be made by the registrant in writing. Prior to the consideration of the claim, the registrant shall submit supporting documentation, such documents being placed in his file folder.

    § 1642.3   Basis for classification in Class 3-A.

#### § § 1642.3

    (a) In Class 3-A shall be placed any registrant:

    (1) Whose induction would result in extreme hardship to his wife when she alone is dependent upon him for support; or

    (2) Whose deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for support; or

    (3) Whose deferment is advisable because his wife and child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for support.

    (b) In its consideration of a claim by a registrant for classification in Class 3-A, the board will first determine whether the registrant's wife, child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon the registrant for support. Support may be financial assistance, personal care or companionship. If financial assistance is the basis of support, the registrant's contribution must be a substantial portion of the necessities of the dependent. Under most circumstances 40 to 50% of the cost of the necessities may be considered substantial. If that determination is affirmative, the board will determine whether the registrant's induction would result in extreme hardship to his wife when she is the only dependent, or whether the registrant's deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for support, or because his wife and his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for support. A deferment is advisable whenever the registrant's induction would result in hardship to his dependents.

    (c) The registrant's classification shall be determined on the basis of the written information in his file, oral statements, if made by the registrant at his personal appearance before a board, and oral statements, if made by the registrant's witnesses at his personal appearances.

    (1) He assumed an obligation to his dependents specifically for the purpose of evading training and service; or

    (2) He acquired excessive financial obligations primarily to establish his dependency claim; or

    (3) His dependents would not be deprived of reasonable support if the registrant is inducted; or

    (4) There are other persons willing and able to assume the support of his dependents; or

    (5) The dependents would suffer only normal anguish of separation from the registrant if he is inducted; or

    (6) The hardship to a dependent is based solely on financial conditions and can be removed by payment and allowances which are payable by the United States to the dependents of persons who are serving in the Armed Forces; or

    (7) The hardship to the dependent is based upon considerations that can be eliminated by payments and allowances which are payable by the United States to the dependents of persons who are serving in the Armed Forces.

    (b) Upon the expiration of a 3-A classification a board shall review any request for an extension of the classification as if it were the first request for that classification, and the fact that the registrant was placed in Class 3-A under apparently similar circumstances will not be a factor in the decision of the board. This section does not relieve a registrant from his duties under § 1621.1 of this chapter.

    § 1645.6   Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for Class 4-D.

#### § § 1645.6

    (a) The board shall first determine whether the registrant is requesting classification in Class 4-D because he is a regular minister of religion or because he is a duly ordained minister of religion.

    (b) If the registrant claims to be a duly ordained minister of religion, the board will:

    (1) Determine whether the registrant has been ordained, in accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a church, religious sect, or organization established on the basis of a community of faith and belief, doctrines and practices of religious character, to preach and teach the doctrines of such church, sect, or organization and to administer the rites and ceremonies thereof in public worship; and

    (2) Determine whether the registrant as his regular, customary, and bona fide vocation, preaches and teaches the principles of religion and administers the ordinances of public worship, as embodied in the creed or principles of the church, sect, or organization by which the registrant was ordained.

    (c) If the registrant claims to be a regular minister of religion, the board will:

    (1) Determine whether the registrant as his customary and regular calling or customary and regular full-time profession, preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, a religious sect, or organization of which he is a member, without having been formally ordained as a minister of religion; and

    (2) Determine whether the registrant is recognized by such church, sect, or organization as a regular minister.

    (d) If the board determines that the registrant is a regular minister of religion or duly ordained minister of religion he shall be classified in Class 4-D.

    § 1645.7   Evaluation of claim.

#### § § 1645.7

    (a) In evaluating a claim for classification in Class 4-D, the board will not consider:

    (1) The training or abilities of the registrant for duty as a minister; or

    (2) The motive or sincerity of the registrant in serving as a minister.

    (b) The board should be careful to ascertain the actual duties and functions of registrants seeking classification in Class 4-D, such classification being appropriate only for leaders of the various religious groups, not granted to members of such groups generally.

    (c) Preaching and teaching the principles of one's sect, if performed part-time or half-time, occasionally or irregularly, are insufficient to establish eligiblity for Class 4-D. These activities must be regularly performed and must comprise the registrant's regular calling or full-time profession. The mere fact of some secular employment on the part of a registrant requesting classification in Class 4-D does not in itself make him ineligible for that class.

In such case, the board chairman shall put a statement of reasons for his action in the registrant's file.

    (h) The making of verbatim transcripts, and the using of cameras or other recording devices are prohibited in proceedings before the board. This does not prevent the registrant or Selective Service from making a written summary of all testimony presented.

    (b)  The Selective Service System shall not act in any controversy involving ASW's wages, hours and working conditions except to the extent any of these subjects is specifically covered in § 1656.7, § 1656.9, or the employment agreement between Selective Service and the employer.

    (c)  Whenever there is evidence that an employer appears to be in violation of § 1656.7, Selective Service will investigate the matter. If the investigation produces substantial evidence of violations of § 1656.7, Selective Service will resolve the matter.

    (a) Selective Service will maintain a job bank for the exclusive purpose of placing ASWs in alternative service jobs.

    (b) An ASW who has identified his own job in accordance with § 1656.5(e) of this part may be assigned by the ASO in that job pending review of the job by Selective Service. If the job is then approved as Alternative Service Work in accordance with § 1656.5(a) the ASW will receive creditable time beginning with the date he was placed on the job by Selective Service. If the job is not approved he will not receive creditable time and will be placed by Selective Service in a position approved for Alternative Service Work. Selective Service must review the job within 30 calendar days of the time it assigned the ASW to begin work. If the elapsed time from date of placement to the date of Selective Service review exceeds 30 days, the ASW will receive creditable time from the date of placement regardless of the final determination of employer eligibility made by Selective Service. If the placement is ultimately determined to be inappropriate for Alternative Service the ASW will be reassigned in accordance with § 1656.12.

    (b)  An ASW will be deemed to have failed to perform satisfactorily whenever:

    (1) He refuses to comply with an order of the Director issued under this part;

    (2) He refuses employment by an approved employer who agrees to hire him;

    (3) His employer terminates the ASW's employment because his conduct, attitude, appearance or performance violates reasonable employer standards; or

    (4) He quits or leaves his job without reasonable justification, and has not submitted an appeal of his job assignment to the District Appeal Board.

    (c)  (1) The sanctions for failure to meet his Alternative Service obligation are job reassignment, loss of creditable time during such period and referral to the Department of Justice for failure to comply with the Military Selective Service Act.

    (2) Prior to invoking any of the sanctions discussed herein, the ASO will conduct a review as prescribed in § 1656.17 of all allegations that an ASW has failed to perform pursuant to any of the provisions of § 1656.11(b).

    (2) An ASW experiences a change in his mental or physical condition which renders him unfit or unable to continue performing satisfactorily in his assigned job;

    (3) An ASW's dependents incur a hardship which is not so severe as to justify a suspension of the Order to Perform Alternative Service under § 1656.15;

    (4) The ASW's employer ceases to operate an approved program or activity;

    (5) The ASW's employer fails to comply with terms and conditions of these regulations or;

    (6) Continual and severe differences between the ASW's employer and ASW remain unresolved.

    (7) The sanctions authorized in § 1656.11 should be applied.

    (b)  Any ASW may request reassignment to another job. An employer may request job reassignment of an ASW who is in his employ.

    (c)  All requests for reassignment must be in writing with the reasons specified. The request may be filed with the ASO of jurisdiction at any time during an ASW's alternative service employment.

    § 1656.13   Review of alternative service job assignments.

#### § § 1656.13

    (a) Review of ASW job assignments will be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

    (c) The ASOM shall reassign the ASW if the ASOM concludes that the ASW's work assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in war which led to his classification as a CO or is in violation of the provisions of this part.

    (d) If the ASOM does not reassign the ASW, the ASW may, within 15 days after the date of mailing of the decision of the ASOM, request a review of his job assignment by a District Appeal Board.

    (e) It shall be the function of the District Appeal Board to determine whether or not an ASW's job assignment violates the ASW's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs of convictions as to participation in war which led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is in violation of the provisions § 1656.5(a) of this part. In making the former determination, the Review Board must be convinced by the ASW that if the ASW performed the job, his convictions as to participation in war would be violated in a similar way as if the ASW had participated in war.

    (f) The District Appeal Board may affirm the assignment or order the reassignment of the ASW in any matter considered by it.

    (g) Procedures of the District Appeal Board are:

    (1) Appeals to the Board shall be in writing, stating as clearly as possible the ground for the appeal.

    (2) The ASW may appear before the Board at his request. He may not be represented by counsel or present witnesses. The ASOM or his representative may represent the Selective Service System at the hearing and present evidence.

    (4) The decision of the Board will be binding only in the case before it. A decision of a Board will not be relied upon by a Board in any other case.

    (5) A decision of the Board is not subject to review within the Selective Service System.

    (d)  The ASW's eligibility for a postponement shall be determined by the office of jurisdiction based upon official documents and other written information contained in his file. Oral statements made by the ASW or made by another person in support of the ASW shall be reduced to writing and placed in the ASW's file.

    (e)  The initial postponement shall not exceed 60 days from the reporting date in the order. When necessary, the Director may grant one further postponement, but the total postponement period shall not exceed 90 days from the reporting date in the order invovled.

    (f)  (1) A postponement may be terminated by the Director for cause upon no less than ten days written notice to the ASW.

If the local board that ordered the ASW to report for Alternative Service determines he would be entitled to classification in Class 3-A, assuming that the ASW were eligible to file a claim for that class, further compliance with his order shall be suspended for a period not to exceed 365 days, as the local board specifies. Extensions of not more than 365 days each may be granted by the local board so long as the hardship continues until the ASW's liability for training and service under the Military Selective Service Act terminates.

    § 1656.18   Computation of creditable time.

    (d) No such claim shall be paid unless it is presented within the period of one year from the date on which the expenses were incurred.

    (e) No such claim shall be allowed in case it is determined that the cause of injury, illness, or death was due to negligence or misconduct of the registrant.

    (f) Burial expenses shall not exceed the maximum prescribed in Section 11 of the Military Selective Service Act in any one case.

    (g) Payment of such claims when allowed shall be made only:

    (1) Directly to the person or facility with which the expenses were incurred; or

    (2) By reimbursement to the registrant, a relative of the registrant, or the legal representative of the registrant's estate, for original payment of such expenses.

    (c) The rules in this part do not revoke, modify, or supersede the SSS regulations relating to disclosure of information in parts 1660 or 1665 of this chapter.

    § 1662.2   Definitions.

#### § § 1662.2

    As used in this part:

    means the Selective Service System. _Agency_ may also refer to any executive department, military department, government corporation, government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any independent regulatory agency. A private organization is not an agency even if it is performing work under contract with the Government or is receiving Federal financial assistance.

    means a senior official of SSS who has an Agency-wide responsibility for ensuring efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA, monitoring implementation of the FOIA throughout SSS, and making recommendations to the Director of Selective Service to improve SSS's implementation of the FOIA. The Director of Selective Service designates a _Chief FOIA Officer_ for the Agency. The Director of Selective Service makes final decisions in response to appeals of the Chief FOIA Officer's determinations.

    includes interests relating to business, trade, and profit, as well as non-profit corporations, individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered a commercial interest.

    consists of the Office of the Director, National Headquarters Directorates and Offices, Data Management Center, Region Offices, and all other organizational entities within SSS that may maintain Agency records subject to a request under the FOIA.

    means the process of reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, to the extent necessary to respond to a request. Copies include paper, electronic records, audiovisual materials, and other formats of Agency records.

    means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education, which operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, a requester must show that the FOIA request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further a scholarly research goal of the institution, and not for a commercial use or purpose, or for individual use or benefit.

    means one of the nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records permitted under section 552(b) of the FOIA.

    means the process set forth in the FOIA that allows requesters to request faster processing of their FOIA request if they meet specific criteria noted in § 1662.12.

    means one of the three categories established by the FOIA to determine whether a requester will be charged fees under FOIA for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: commercial use requests; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions and news media requests; and all other requests.

    means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester meets the requirements set forth in § 1662.13.

    means an SSS official whom the Director of Selective Service has delegated the authority to assist the Chief _FOIA Officer_ in releasing or withholding records; assessing, waiving, or reducing fees in response to FOIA requests; and all other determinations regarding the processing of a FOIA request. In this capacity, the FOIA Officer is authorized to request and receive responsive records that may be maintained by other Agency components. Except for records subject to proactive disclosure pursuant to section (a)(2) of the FOIA, only the Chief FOIA Officer has the authority to release or withhold records or to waive fees in response to a FOIA request.

    means an Agency official who reports to the Agency Chief FOIA Officer and serves as a supervisory official to whom a requester can raise concerns about the service the requester received concerning the processing of the FOIA request. This individual is responsible for increasing transparency in the Agency's FOIA business process, helping requesters understand the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes. The _FOIA Public Liaison_ may be contacted via email at

    means a written request that meets the criteria in § 1662.6.

    or  means the law codified at 5 U.S.C. 552 that provides the public with the right to request Agency records from Federal executive branch agencies.

    means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals, including print and online publications that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the public. SSS does not consider FOIA requests for records that support the news dissemination function of the requester to be commercial use. SSS considers “freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity as working for that entity. A publishing contract provides the clearest evidence that a journalist expects publication; however, SSS also considers a requester's past publication record.

    means an institution that does not further the commercial, trade, or profit interests of any person or entity and is operated for the purpose of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.

    means the electronic application that SSS uses to process FOIA requests. The public may also submit requests directly to SSS via the online —Freedom of Information Act.

    means any individual or organization whose FOIA request does not qualify as a commercial-use request, representative of the news media request (including a request made by a freelance journalist), or an educational or non-commercial scientific institution request.

    means the process of preparing the records for duplication, including the time spent in preparing the records for duplication ( materials used, records/database retrieval, employee, and contractor time, as well as systems processing time).

    means an electronic location(s) that SSS uses to post records that are made available to the public without a specific request. SSS makes reading room records electronically available to the public through the SSS website,  including at

    means any information maintained by an Agency, regardless of format, that is made or received in connection with official Agency business that is under the Agency's control at the time of the FOIA request. _Record(s)_ includes any information maintained for an Agency by a third party. Record(s) does not include personal records of an employee, or other information in formally organized and officially designated SSS libraries and reading rooms, where such materials are available under the rules of the particular library.

    means delete or mark over.

    means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.

    means asking for records, whether or not the requester refers specifically to the FOIA. _Request_s from federal agencies, subpoenas, and court orders for documents are not included within this definition.

    unless otherwise specifically defined in this part, means examining records responsive to a request to determine whether any portions are exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing a record for disclosure ( doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure), including redacting the record and marking the appropriate FOIA exemptions. It does not include the process of resolving general legal or policy issues regarding exemptions.

    means the process of identifying, locating, and retrieving records responsive to a request, whether in hard copy or in electronic form or format, or by manual or automated/electronic means.

    mean performing additional services outside of those required under the FOIA to respond to a request. Examples include using an overnight mail service to send the Agency's response to a FOIA request.

    means the Selective Service System.

    means any person or entity that provides trade secrets or commercial or financial information to the Agency, and includes individuals, corporations, other organizational entities, and state and foreign governments.

    means temporarily stopping the running of a time limit. SSS may toll a FOIA request to seek clarification from the requester or to address fee issues, as further described in § 1662.11.

    means trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are confidential, and are obtained by the Agency from a submitter, such that it may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

    § 1662.3   SSS's FOIA policy.

#### § § 1662.3

    (a)  The Agency will withhold information only if the Chief FOIA Officer reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or if disclosure is prohibited by law.

    (b)  As described in § 1662.9, the Agency's Chief FOIA Officer has the authority to:

    (1) Release or withhold records in response to initial requests;

    (2) Grant or deny expedited processing; and

    (3) Reduce or waive fees.

    (c)  The Agency makes available for public inspection, in an electronic format, records that have been requested and released three or more times and other specified records described in § 1662.26.

    (d)  The FOIA does not require an Agency to give opinions, conduct research, answer questions, or create records.

    § 1662.4   Relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974.

#### § § 1662.4

    (a)  The FOIA and the rules in this part apply to all SSS records. The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in a system of records.

    (b)  If you have filed a FOIA request and are an individual requesting your own records that are maintained in a system of records, or if you are a parent or legal guardian authorized to act on behalf of a minor or custodian who is seeking the records about a minor or individual who has been declared incompetent, the Agency will handle your request under the Privacy Act.

    § 1662.5   Who can file a FOIA request?

#### § § 1662.5

    Any member of the public may submit a FOIA request to SSS. Under the FOIA, “member of the public” includes requests from individuals, corporations, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign entities. Requests from Federal agencies and Federal or state courts are not covered by the FOIA.

    § 1662.6   Requirements of a FOIA request.

#### § § 1662.6

    (a) To be considered a FOIA request under this part, the following must occur:

    (1) The request must be written (either by hand or electronically);

    (2) The request must be submitted in accordance with § 1662.7;

    (3) The requester must provide the following required contact information: requester's name, U.S. or foreign postal address, description of records sought, and fee willing to pay. While not required, the Agency encourages requesters to provide us with their email address and phone number; and

    (4) The request must clearly state and reasonably describe what SSS records are requested. Broad, sweeping requests and vague requests are not reasonably described. The requester must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to locate the records within a reasonable amount of effort. When known, requests should identify the records sought by providing the name/title of the record, applicable date range, subject matter, offices, or employees involved, and record type. If the request is for electronic communications, such as email records, it would assist SSS if the requestor could provide as much information as possible, such as the names, position titles, or other identifying information about the Agency employees involved, as well as the applicable timeframe. Absent sufficient details, the Agency may be unable to search for or locate the records sought. The greater the date range, the longer it may take to process the request and the greater amount of fees that may be charged.

    (b) Requests that do not meet the required criteria above are not considered proper FOIA requests.

    (c) The FOIA requires an Agency to provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the Agency in that form or format. SSS will not search or produce records in response to a FOIA request that the FOIA Officer determines would be unduly burdensome (as defined in case law) to process. FOIA requests are unreasonably burdensome when it is a broad, sweeping request that lacks specificity.

    § 1662.7   Where to submit a FOIA request.

#### § § 1662.7

    Requesters must submit FOIA requests in writing to the Agency through one of the following options:

    (a)  link available from the Agency's  website.

    (b)

    (c)  SSS, ATTN: Freedom of Information Act Officer, 1501 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 700, Arlington, VA 22209.

    § 1662.8   Requests not processed under the FOIA.

#### § § 1662.8

    (a) The Chief FOIA Officer will not process a request under the FOIA and the regulations in this part to the extent it asks for records that are currently publicly available, either from SSS or from another part of the Federal Government, unless the requester does not have access to the internet and cannot retrieve records online. See § 1662.26.

    (b) The Chief FOIA Officer will not process a request under the FOIA and the regulations in this part if the records sought are distributed by the Agency as part of its regular program activity, for example, public information leaflets distributed by SSS. See §§ 1662.26 through 1662.28.

    (c) The Chief FOIA Officer will not process a request under the FOIA that does not meet the requirements of a FOIA request as defined in § 1662.21. When a request under FOIA does not meet the requirements of § 1662.21, the Chief FOIA Officer will send written correspondence to the requester:

    (1) Providing instructions for how to submit a proper FOIA request; or

    (2) Asking for additional information to make the request a proper FOIA request.

    § 1662.9   Chief FOIA Officer's authority.

#### § § 1662.9

    (a)  The Chief FOIA Officer is authorized to make determinations about:

    (1) Release or withholding of records;

    (2) Expedited processing;

    (3) Charging or waiver of fees; and

    (4) Other matters relating to processing a request for records under this part.

    (b)  The Chief FOIA Officer's determination is provided in writing to the requester via emailed communication or, in the absence of the requester's email address, via U.S. postal mail. If the requester disagrees with the FOIA Officer's determination in response to items identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the requester may appeal the determination to the Director of Selective Service, as described in § 1662.16.

    § 1662.10   Responsibility for responding to requests.

#### § § 1662.10

    (a)  When the Chief FOIA Officer first receives a request for a record and SSS maintains that record, it is the responsibility of SSS to respond to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, SSS ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, SSS will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.

    (b)  The Chief FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by SSS. Denials may be appealed to the Director of the Selective Service.

    (c)  When reviewing records located by SSS in response to a request, the Chief FOIA Officer will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Agency must proceed in one of the following ways:

    (1)  When records originated with SSS but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, SSS will consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.

    (2)  (i) When the Chief FOIA Officer believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Chief FOIA Officer will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Chief FOIA Officer and the originating agency jointly agree that SSS is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

    (ii) Whenever the Chief FOIA Officer refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that Agency's FOIA contact information.

    (3)  The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its file's records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Chief FOIA Officer locates within its files material originating from an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Chief FOIA Officer will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on whether the record may be disclosed. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will then be conveyed to the requester by the Chief FOIA Officer.

    (d)  On receipt of any request involving classified information, the Chief FOIA Officer must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the Chief FOIA Officer will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever the record of SSS contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the Chief FOIA Officer will refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.

    (e)  All consultations and referrals received by the Chief FOIA Officer will be handled according to the date that SSS received the perfected FOIA request.

    (f)  The Chief FOIA Officer may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

    § 1662.11   How does SSS process FOIA requests?

#### § § 1662.11

    (a)  (1) The Chief FOIA Officer acknowledges all FOIA requests in writing within ten business days after the Agency's receipt of the request. The acknowledgement email or letter restates the FOIA request and provides the requester with the request's tracking number.

    (2) If the Chief FOIA Officer requires clarification to process the FOIA request, the Chief FOIA Officer will contact the requester either via email, U.S. postal mail, or phone call. The Chief FOIA Officer will attempt to contact requesters twice. If the Chief FOIA Officer does not receive a response to their clarification attempts within 30 calendar days from the date of the first contact to the requester, the Chief FOIA Officer will close the FOIA request due to insufficient information.

    (b)  FOIA requests are considered “perfected,”  the 20-business day statutory time begins, when the request meets the requirements of the proper FOIA request listed in § 1662.6. There may be times that the Chief FOIA Officer requires more information from the requester after perfecting a request. The 20-business day period may be extended in unusual circumstances by written notice to the requester. See paragraph (e) of this section.

    (c)  Unless granted expedited processing, the Chief FOIA Officer processes FOIA requests according to a first-in, first-out basis. See § 1662.12 for information on expedited processing.

    (d)  FOIA requests are categorized as either simple or complex, depending on the nature of the request and the estimated processing time:

    (1)  For most non-expedited requests, the Chief FOIA Officer makes a determination about release of the record(s) requested within 20 business days.

    (2)  The Chief FOIA Officer will place into a complex processing queue any request that cannot be completed within 20 business days due to unusual circumstances. The Chief FOIA Officer notifies requesters in writing if it is necessary for SSS to take additional time to process a request and of the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services with the OGIS. See § 1662.15.

    (e)  (1) Unusual circumstances exist when there is a need to:

    (i) Search for and collect records from SSS components or locations that are separate from National Headquarters;

    (ii) Search for, collect, and review a voluminous number of records that are part of a single request; and/or

    (iii) Consult with two or more SSS components or another agency having substantial interest in the request before releasing the records.

    (2) Within the unusual circumstances letter to the requester, the Chief FOIA Officer will provide an estimated date that they will contact the requester with the applicable fee notice and/or further correspondence. The Chief FOIA Officer will also advise the requester that they may modify or narrow the scope of their request.

    (f)  FOIA requesters are issued a fee notice from the Chief FOIA Officer that informs them of the estimated search and review time associated with processing their FOIA request. For more information on fees, see § 1662.13.

    (g)  (1) The Chief FOIA Officer may stop or toll the 20 business days in two circumstances:

    (i) The Chief FOIA Officer may stop the clock one time if they require additional information regarding the specifics of the request; and

    (ii) The Chief FOIA Officer may stop the clock as many times as needed regarding fee assessments.

    (2) The processing time will resume upon the Chief FOIA Officer's receipt of the requester's response. There may be instances when the Chief FOIA Officer requires multiple clarifications on a FOIA request. After the first request for clarification, any additional clarifications are performed without tolling the clock. Should the requester not respond to any correspondence wherein the Chief FOIA Officer requests clarification, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, the Agency reserves the right to administratively close the FOIA request if the Chief FOIA Officer does not receive a response within 30 business days of the date of their correspondence requesting clarification.

    (h)  The Agency is required to furnish copies of records only when they are in the Agency's possession or SSS can retrieve them from storage. The Federal government follows National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) rules on record retention. Records are retained or destroyed under the guidelines of the Federal Records Act.

    (i)  SSS will search for records to satisfy a request using methods that can be reasonably expected to produce the requested records. Nevertheless, the Agency may not be able to find the records requested using the information provided by the requester, or they may not exist. If the Chief FOIA Officer advises that SSS is unable to find the records despite a diligent search, the requester may appeal the no records determination to the Director of Selective Service, as described in § 1662.16.

    (j)  The Chief FOIA Officer will provide the requester with the record(s) requested unless disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law. When information within a responsive record(s) is exempt from disclosure, the information is redacted and the applicable FOIA exemption(s) are noted within the redacted cell. The Chief FOIA Officer will make reasonable efforts to provide the records in the form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format. The Chief FOIA Officer may provide individual records as the Agency processes them on a rolling basis, or the Chief FOIA Officer may release all responsive records once the request is completed. See § 1662.14 for more information on the release of records by SSS.

    § 1662.12   Expedited processing.

#### § § 1662.12

    (a) Expedited processing must be requested at the same time as the FOIA request. The Chief FOIA Officer provides expedited processing when the requester can demonstrate a “compelling need” for the requested information, such as:

    (1) When there is an imminent threat to the life or safety of a person;

    (2) When the request is from the media, or others primarily engaged in disseminating information, and shows an immediate urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged government activities; or

    (3) When the requester can show, in detail and to the Chief FOIA Officer's satisfaction, that a prompt response is needed because the requester may be denied a legal right, benefit, or remedy without the requested information, and that it cannot be obtained elsewhere in a reasonable amount of time.

    (b) Only the Chief FOIA Officer may make the decision to grant or deny expedited processing. Requests that do not meet the “compelling need” criteria will be processed normally. If the Chief FOIA Officer does not grant the request for expedited processing, the requester may appeal the denial to the Director of Selective Service. In the appeal letter, the requester should explain why they believe their request demonstrates a “compelling need,” such as describing how the request meets the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. The process described in § 1662.16 will apply to these appeals.

    § 1662.13   Fees associated with processing FOIA requests.

#### § § 1662.13

    (a)  In responding to FOIA requests, the Chief FOIA Officer shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (i) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Chief FOIA Officer should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

    (1)  (i) Requests made by educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. The Chief FOIA Officer may properly charge for time spent searching even if the Agency does not locate any responsive records or if the Chief FOIA Officer determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees shall be as follows: professional—$10.00; and clerical/administrative—$4.75.

    (iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified by the Chief FOIA Officer of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

    (iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by the Agency at a Federal records center operated by NARA, additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

    (2)  Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. The Chief FOIA Officer shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the Chief FOIA Officer shall provide one copy per request at a cost of five cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, components shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the Chief FOIA Officer shall charge the direct costs.

    (3)  Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by the Chief FOIA Officer to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Agency's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (b)  (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for commercial use), non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.

    (2) If the Agency fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, the Chief FOIA Officer may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

    (i) If the Chief FOIA Officer has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and they provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

    (ii) If the Chief FOIA Officer has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Chief FOIA Officer may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. The Chief FOIA Officer must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the Chief FOIA Officer must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Chief FOIA Officer may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

    (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

    (3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

    (4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Chief FOIA Officer shall provide without charge:

    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

    (ii) The first two hours of search.

    (5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (a) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.

    (c)  (1) When the Chief FOIA Officer determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Chief FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Chief FOIA Officer shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a non-commercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

    (2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a non-commercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing to the Chief FOIA Officer, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Agency is not required to accept payments in installments.

    (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Chief FOIA Officer estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, they shall toll the processing of the request when they notify the requester of the estimated fees more than the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Chief FOIA Officer shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

    (4) The Agency shall make available the FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

    (d)  Although not required to provide special services, if the Chief FOIA Officer chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

    (e)  The Chief FOIA Officer may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Chief FOIA Officer. The Chief FOIA Officer shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

    (f)  When the Chief FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Chief FOIA Officer may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Chief FOIA Officer may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Chief FOIA Officer will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

    (g)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section, the Chief FOIA Officer shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work on a request is commenced or continued. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

    (2) When the Chief FOIA Officer determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, they may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Chief FOIA Officer may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when they receive a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the Agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Chief FOIA Officer may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Chief FOIA Officer may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the FOIA Officer begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Chief FOIA Officer has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

    (4) In cases in which the Chief FOIA Officer requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Chief FOIA Officer's fee determination, the request will be closed.

    (h)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily based fee schedule program, the Chief FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

    (i)  (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

    (2) The Chief FOIA Officer must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when they determine, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In deciding whether this standard is satisfied the component must consider the factors described in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:

    (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

    (ii) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

    (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

    (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Chief FOIA Officer will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

    (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Chief FOIA Officer will consider the following criteria:

    (A) FOIA requires an Agency requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

    (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Chief FOIA Officer must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Chief FOIA Officer ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

    (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

    (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Chief FOIA Officer and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request later so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

    § 1662.14   Release of records.

#### § § 1662.14

    (a)  If the Agency has released a record, or a part of a record, to others in the past, the Chief FOIA Officer will ordinarily release it to the requester, as well. However, the Chief FOIA Officer will not release it to a requester if a statute forbids this disclosure; an exemption applies that was not previously applicable; or if the previous release was unauthorized.

    (b)  Section 552(b) of the FOIA explains the nine exemptions under which the Chief FOIA Officer may withhold records requested under the FOIA. Within §§ 1662.18 through 1662.25, the Agency describes the FOIA exemptions and explain how the Chief FOIA Officer applies them to disclosure determinations. In some cases, more than one exemption may apply to the same document. Section 552(b) of the FOIA, while providing nine exemptions from mandatory disclosure, does not itself provide any assurance of confidentiality by the Agency.

    (c)  If the record(s) requested are already publicly available, either in the SSS electronic reading room or elsewhere online, such as at  SSS will direct the requester to the publicly available record(s), unless the requester does not have access to the internet.

    (d)  If the Chief FOIA Officer cannot make a legible copy of a record to be released, they do not attempt to reconstruct it. Instead, the Chief FOIA Officer will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in their reply.

    § 1662.15   FOIA Public Liaison and the Office of Government Information Services.

#### § § 1662.15

    The Chief FOIA Officer notifies requesters of their right to seek dispute resolution from the FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS within the SSS fee notices, responses to determinations identified in § 1662.9(a), and responses to appeals.

    (a)  If requesters have questions about the response to their request or wish to seek dispute resolutions services within SSS, the requester may contact the FOIA Public Liaison via email to .

    (b)  OGIS is an entity outside of SSS that offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. OGIS' contact information will be provided in any decision letter issued by the Chief FOIA Officer and Director of Selective Service.

    § 1662.16   Appeals of the Chief FOIA Officer's determination.

#### § § 1662.16

    (a)  If a requester disagrees with the Chief FOIA Officer's determination in response to items specified in § 1662.9, the requester may appeal the decision to the Director of Selective Service. The appeal must meet the following requirements:

    (1) Be submitted in writing via the avenues identified in § 1662.7;

    (2) Be received within 90 days from the date of the determination the requester is appealing; and

    (3) Explain what the requester is appealing and include additional information to support the appeal.

    (b)  The Director of Selective Service acknowledges all appeals in writing within 10 business days after their receipt of the appeal. The acknowledgement is provided via email or, when the requester does not provide an email address, via U.S. postal mail. The acknowledgement email or letter restates the FOIA appeal and provides the requester with the appeal's tracking number.

    (c)  FOIA appeals are categorized as either simple or complex, based on the designation of the initial request.

    (1)  Generally, the Director of Selective Service makes a determination about release of the requested record(s) within 20 business days.

    (2)  Appeals of complex requests cannot be completed within 20 business days due to unusual circumstances. During the Director of Selective Service's processing of the appeal, they will need to consult with appropriate SSS component(s), including legal counsel; therefore, the Director of Selective Service generally requires more than 20 business days to issue a final decision on the appeal.

    (d)  The Director of Selective Service makes decisions on appeals of the Chief FOIA Officer's determinations.

    (1) The Director of Selective Service's final decision is provided in writing to the requester via email or, in the absence of the requester's email address, via U.S. postal mail.

    (2) The final decision letter will explain the basis of the decision (for example, the reasons why an exemption applies).

    (e)  If a requester disagrees with the final decision issued by the Director of Selective Service, they may seek assistance from OGIS, as described in § 1662.15. Requesters may also ask a U.S. District Court to review the Director of Selective Service's final decision. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).

    § 1662.17   U.S. District Court action.

#### § § 1662.17

    If the Director of Selective Service, upon review, affirms the denial of the Chief FOIA Officer's determination of items specified in § 1662.9(a), requesters may ask a U.S. District Court to review that denial. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).

    § 1662.18   The FOIA Exemption 1: National defense and foreign policy.

#### § § 1662.18

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure records that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order.

    § 1662.19   The FOIA Exemption 2: Internal personnel rules and practices.

#### § § 1662.19

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure records that are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.

    § 1662.20   The FOIA Exemption 3: Records exempted by other statutes.

#### § § 1662.20

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure records if another statute specifically allows or requires the agency to withhold them. The Chief FOIA Officer may use another statute to justify withholding only if it prohibits disclosure; it sets forth criteria to guide the Chief FOIA Officer's decision on releasing; or identifies types of material to be withheld.

    § 1662.21   The FOIA Exemption 4: Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.

#### § § 1662.21

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure trade secrets as well as commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person that is either privileged or confidential. SSS will allow submitters to designate information as trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter. Submitters must use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under the FOIA exemptions. These designations expire ten years after the due date of the submission unless the submitter requests a longer designation period.

    (a) —(1)  When trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information is requested under the FOIA, the Chief FOIA Officer will provide written submitter's notice if they have substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under the FOIA Exemption 4. The submitter's notice will describe and include a copy of the trade secret, or commercial or financial information requested. In cases involving many submitters, SSS may publish a submitter's notice to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure instead of sending individual notifications. The submitter's notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

    (i) The Chief FOIA Officer determines the information is fully exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

    (ii) The information has been previously published or made generally available; or

    (iii) Disclosure of the information is required by statute other than the FOIA.

    (2)  (i) The submitter must respond to the notice within five business days of the Chief FOIA Officer issuing the submitter's notice or the information may be released in accordance with these regulations and the FOIA. A submitter who fails to respond within five business days will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. The Chief FOIA Officer is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

    (ii) If a submitter objects to disclosure, the submitter should provide the Chief FOIA Officer with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. To rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.

    (iii) The Chief FOIA Officer will consider a submitter's timely made objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

    (3)  Whenever the Chief FOIA Officer decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, they must provide the following to the submitter:

    (i) A Release Over Objection letter explaining the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections did not meet the requirements for withholding under the FOIA;

    (ii) A copy of the information as SSS intends to release it; and

    (iii) A statement of the Chief FOIA Officer's intent to disclose the information five business days from the date on the Release Over Objection letter unless the submitter files an action in a U.S. District Court to prevent the release.

    (b)  When a submitter's notice is issued for a request that is the subject of a lawsuit, the Chief FOIA Officer shall notify the submitter of the lawsuit within the notice.

    (c)  To the extent the Chief FOIA Officer expects substantial delays in the processing of FOIA requests due to the Agency's communications with the submitter, they will notify the requester in writing via email, or when the requester's email is not provided, via U.S. postal mail.

    § 1662.22   The FOIA Exemption 5: Internal documents.

#### § § 1662.22

    This exemption covers inter-agency or intra-agency government documents that fall within an evidentiary privilege recognized in civil discovery. Such internal government communications include an agency's communications with an outside consultant or other outside person, with a court, or with Congress, when those communications are for a purpose similar to the purpose of privileged intra-agency communications. Some of the most commonly applicable privileges are described in the following paragraphs:

    (a)  This privilege protects the decision-making processes of government agencies. Information is protected under this privilege if it is pre-decisional and deliberative. The purpose of the privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of the agency decision-making process by encouraging open and frank internal discussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of decisions not yet adopted, and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosing reasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision. Purely factual material in a deliberative document is within this privilege only if it is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so that it cannot reasonably be segregated, if it would reveal the nature of the deliberative portions, or if its disclosure would in some other way make possible an intrusion into the decision-making process. The privilege continues to protect pre-decisional documents even after a decision is made; however, the Chief FOIA Officer will release pre-decisional deliberative communications that were created 25 years or more before the date on which the records are requested, unless disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law.

    (b)  This privilege protects records prepared by or for an attorney in anticipation of or for litigation. It includes documents prepared for purposes of administrative and court proceedings. This privilege extends to information directly prepared by an attorney, as well as materials prepared by non-attorneys working for an attorney.

    (c)  This privilege protects confidential communications between an attorney and the attorney's client where legal advice is sought or provided.

    § 1662.23   The FOIA Exemption 6: Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

#### § § 1662.23

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure records about individuals if disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy.

    § 1662.24   The FOIA Exemption 7: Law enforcement.

#### § § 1662.24

    The FOIA exempts from disclosure information or records that the government has compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may apply to actual or potential violations of either criminal or civil laws or regulations. The Agency can withhold these records only to the extent that releasing them would cause harm in at least one of the following situations:

    (a)  Pursuant to the FOIA Exemption 7(A) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(a)), the Chief FOIA Officer may withhold information whose release could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category.

    (b)  Under the FOIA Exemption 7(B) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(b)), the FOIA exempts from disclosure records whose release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudication because of prejudicial publicity.

    (c)  Under the FOIA Exemption 7(C) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(c)), the FOIA exempts from disclosure personally identifiable information of individuals when the disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

    (d)  Pursuant to the FOIA Exemption 7(D) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(d)), the FOIA exempts from disclosure the identity of confidential sources, as well as the records obtained from the confidential sources in criminal investigations or by an agency conducting a lawful national security investigation. A confidential source may be an individual; a state, local, or foreign government agency; or any private organization. The exemption applies whether the source provides information under an express promise of confidentiality or under circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred; however, inferred confidentiality is determined in a case-by-case analysis. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is any information which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sources to investigatory agencies.

    (e)  Under the FOIA Exemption 7(E) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(e)), the FOIA exempts from disclosure records reflecting special techniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution, not otherwise generally known to the public. In some cases, it is not possible to describe even in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very material to be withheld. The Chief FOIA Officer may also withhold records whose release would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if this disclosure could reasonably be expected to create a risk that someone could circumvent requirements of law or of regulation.

    (f)  Under the FOIA Exemption 7(F) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(f)), the Chief FOIA Officer may withhold records whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment, as well as to physical violence.

    § 1662.25   The FOIA Exemptions 8 and 9: Records on financial institutions; records on wells.

#### § § 1662.25

    Exemption 8 exempts from disclosure records about regulation or supervision of financial institutions. Exemption 9 exempts from disclosure geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

    § 1662.26   Records available for public inspection.

#### § § 1662.26

    Under the FOIA, SSS is required to make available for public inspection in an electronic format:

    (a) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;

    (b) The Agency's statements and interpretations of policy that have been adopted but are not published in the ;

    (c) Administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect the public; and

    (d) Copies of records, regardless of form or format, that an agency determines will likely become the subject of subsequent requests, as well as records that have been requested and released three or more times, unless said materials are published and copies are offered to sale.

    § 1662.27   Where records are published.

#### § § 1662.27

    Materials SSS is required to publish pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2) are published in one of the following ways:

    (a) By publication in the  of Selective Service System regulations, and by their subsequent inclusion in the Code of Federal Regulations;

    (b) By publication in the  of appropriate general notices; and/or

    (c) By other forms of publication, when incorporated by reference in the  with the approval of the Director of the *Federal Register*.

    § 1662.28   Publications for sale through the Government Publishing Office.

#### § § 1662.28

    The public may purchase publications containing information pertaining to the program, organization, functions, and procedures of SSS from the electronic U.S. Government Bookstore maintained by the Government Publishing Office. The publications for sale include but are not limited to:

    § 1665.1   Rules for determining if an individual is the subject of a record.

#### § § 1665.1

    (a) Individuals desiring to know if a specific system of records maintained by the Selective Service System (SSS) contains a record pertaining to them should address their inquiries in writing or by electronic means to the Selective Service System, ATTN: Records Manager, Public and Intergovernmental Affairs Directorate, Arlington, VA 22209-2425. Online inquiries in English and Spanish may be made at: Contact Us | Selective Service System: Selective Service System (sss.gov) or by email using  The written or electronic inquiry should contain the following information: name and address of the requester, email address of subject (for electronic requests only), identity of the systems of records, and nature of the request. It should also include identifying information specified in the applicable SSS System of Record Notices to assist in identifying the request, such as location of the record, if known, full name, birth date, time periods in which the records are believed to have been complied, etc. SSS Systems of Record Notices subject to the Privacy Act is in the  and copies of the notices will be available upon request to the records manager. A compilation of such notices will also be made and published by the Office of *Federal Register*, in accord with 5 U.S.C. 552a(f). Requesters seeking copies of their registration records with the SSS may first seek to obtain their registration number and related information by visiting  and making the request. To make this request, the individual must provide their last name, social security number and date of birth when completing the required fields to access their registration information online. For other documentation requests such as for a registration Status of Information Letter (SIL), the individual must make the request electronically or in writing and send via the United States Postal Service (USPS).

    (b) For requesters who make a hand-written request for USPS delivery or electronic request for information to SSS, will ordinarily be informed of whether the named system of records contains a record pertaining to the requester within 10 days of receipt of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference the procedures which must be followed by the individual making the request in order to gain access to the record.

    (c) Whenever a response cannot be made within 10 days, the records manager will inform the requester of the reason for the delay and the date by which a response may be anticipated.

    § 1665.2   Requests for access.

#### § § 1665.2

    (a) Requirement for written or electronic requests. Individuals desiring to gain access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must submit their request in writing or electronically (as specified in § 1665.1(a)) in accord with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below.

    (b) —(1)  (i) The request for access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the records manager, at the address cited above, and shall name the system of records or contain a description of such system of records. The request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of specifying solely the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if the request may be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act and the request specifies both or neither act, the procedures under the Privacy Act of 1974 will be employed. The individual will be advised that the procedures of the Privacy Act will be utilized, of the existence and the general effect of the Freedom of Information Act, and the difference between procedures under the two acts (e.g. fees, time limits, access). The request should contain necessary information to verify the identity of the requester (see § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi)). In addition, the requester should include any other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained in and required by SSS Notice of Systems of Records.

    (ii) If the request for access follows a prior request under § 1665.1, the same identifying information need not be included in the request for access if a reference is made to that prior correspondence, or a copy of the SSS response to that request is attached.

    (iii) If the individual specifically desires a copy of the record, the request should so specify.

    (2)  A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days, except when the records manager determines that access cannot be afforded in that time, in which case the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay and an estimated date by which the request will be answered. Normally access will be granted within 30 days from the date the request was received by the Selective Service System. At a minimum, the answer to the request for access shall include the following:

    (i) A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by SSS;

    (ii) A statement as to whether access will be granted only by providing copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time, alternative arrangements may be made with the official specified in § 1665.2(b)(1);

    (iii) A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will be the sole means of granting access only when the records manager has determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of access;

    (iv) The amount of fees charged, if any (see § 1665.6) (Fees are applicable only to requests for copies);

    (v) The name, title, and telephone number of the SSS official having operational control over the record; and

    (vi) The documentation required by SSS to verify the identity of the requester. At a minimum, SSS's verification standards include the following:

    (A)  Current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS may, in addition to the other requirements of this section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual observation. If the current or former SSS employee cannot be so identified by the official having operational control over the records, identification documentation will be required. Employee identification cards, annuitant identification, drivers licenses, or the  of any official personnel document in the record are examples of acceptable identification validation.

    (B)  Individuals other than current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must produce identification documentation of the type described herein, prior to being granted access. The extent of the identification documentation required will depend on the type of record to be accessed. In most cases, identification verification will be accomplished by the presentation of two forms of identification. Any additional requirements are specified in the system notices published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4).

    (C)  For records to be accessed by mail, the records manager shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification documentation will be required for the disclosure to the requester of information required to be made available to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552. When in the opinion of the records manager the granting of access through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar assurance of identity will be required.

    (D)  If an individual is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to a record about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the records sought to be accessed, the official having operational control over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may be considered appropriate e.g., statements of other individuals who can attest to the identity of the requester. No verification of identity will be required of individuals seeking access to records which are otherwise available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, Freedom of Information Act.

    (E)  A parent of a minor, upon  may access on behalf of the minor  maintained by SSS in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction.  a parent or legal guardian has no absolute right to have access to a record about a child. Minors are not precluded from exercising on their own behalf rights given to them by the Privacy Act.

    (F)  When an individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records maintained by SSS wishes to be accompanied by another individual during the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the request shall submit to the official having operational control of the record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.

    (G)  If the official having operational control over the records in a system of records maintained by SSS determines that an individual seeking access has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit access, the official shall consult with the records manager prior to finally denying the individual access.

    (H)  Whenever the records manager determines, in accordance with the procedures herein, that access cannot be granted the response will also include a statement of the procedures to obtain a review of the decision to deny in accord with § 1665.5.

    (vii)  (A) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. The mere fact that records in a system of records are frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not intended to preclude access by an individual to the records which are available to that individual under the other processes such as the Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.

    (B) Within any system of records pertaining to possible violations of the Military Selective Service Act, the identity of or any information pertaining to any individual who provides information relating to a suspected violator will not be revealed to the suspected violator. This exemption is made under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

    § 1665.3   Access to the accounting of disclosures from records.

#### § § 1665.3

    Rules governing the granting of access to the accounting of disclosure are the same as those for granting accesses to the records (including verification of identity) outlined in § 1665.2.

    § 1665.4   Requests to amend records.

#### § § 1665.4

    (a)  Individuals desiring to amend a record that pertains to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must submit their request in writing or electronically (as specified in § 1665.1(a)) in accord with the procedures set forth herein. Records not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be amended in accord with these provisions. However, individuals who believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention of SSS.

    (b)  (1)(i) The requests to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the records manager. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and SSS will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.

    (ii) When the individual's identity has been previously verified pursuant to § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi), further verification of identity is not required as long as the communication does not suggest that a need for verification is present. If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, SSS may require identification validation as described in § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of a request to amend a record should contact the records manager at the address cited above.

    (iii) The exact portion of the record the individual seeks to have amended should be clearly indicated. If possible, the proposed alternative language should also be set forth, or at a minimum, the facts which the individual believes are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete should be set forth with such particularity as to permit SSS not only to understand the individual's basis for the request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.

    (iv) The request must also set forth the reasons why the individual believes his record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In order to avoid the retention by SSS of personal information merely to permit verification of records, the burden of persuading SSS to amend a record will be upon the individual. The individual must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the official in charge of the system of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness or incompleteness of the record.

    (v) Incomplete or inaccurate requests will not be rejected categorically. The individual will be asked to clarify the request as needed.

    (2)  To the extent possible, a decision, upon a request to amend a record will be made within 10 days, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays). The response reflecting the decisions upon a request for amendment will include the following:

    (i) The decision of the Selective Service System whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of the request to amend the record.

    (ii) The reasons for determination for any portion of the request which is denied.

    (iii) The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of the denial may be lodged.

    (iv) The name and address of the official designated to assist, as necessary and upon request of, the individual making the request in preparation of the appeal.

    (v) A description of the review of the appeal with SSS (see § 1665.5).

    (vi) A description of any other procedures which may be required of the individual in order to process the appeal.

    (3) If the nature of the request for the correction of the system of records precludes a decision within 10 days, the individual making the request will be informed within 10 days of the extended date for a decision. Such a decision will be issued as soon as it is reasonably possible, normally within 30 days from the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) unless unusual circumstances preclude completing action within that time. If the expected completion date for the decision indicated cannot be met, the individual will be advised of the delay of a revised date when the decision may be expected to be completed.

    § 1665.5   Appeals.

#### § § 1665.5

    (a) If the requester is dissatisfied with the SSS response, the requester can appeal an adverse determination denying the request to the appellate authority listed in the notification of denial letter. The appeal must be made in writing or electronically (as specified in § 1665.1(a)), and it must be postmarked (or sent by email) within 60 calendar days of the date of the letter denying the initial request for records or amendment of information. The appeal should include a copy of the SSS determination (including the assigned request number, if known). For the quickest possible handling, the appeal whether in writing or by email should specify that it is a “Privacy Act Appeal.” If the requester is dissatisfied with the SSS response, the requester can appeal an adverse determination denying an initial request to access or amend a record in accordance with the provisions of §§ 1665.2 and 1665.4. The requester should submit the appeal in writing or electronically (as specified in § 1665.1(a)) and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their appeal should contact the records manager at the address provided herein.

    (b) The appeal should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from SSS in which the request to access or to amend was denied and also the reasons why the requester believes that access should be granted or the disputed information amended. The appeal should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons as required by §§ 1665.2 and 1665.4 set forth by SSS in its decision denying access or amendment. Appeals filed without a complete statement by the requester setting forth the reasons for review will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate process as meaningful as possible, the requester's disagreement should be set forth in an understandable manner. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, SSS reserves the right to dispose of the material concerning the request to access or amend a record if no appeal in accord with this section is received by SSS within 180 days of the mailing by SSS of its decision upon an initial request. A appeal received after the 180 day period may, at the discretion of the records manager, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.

    (c) The appeal should be addressed to the Director of Selective Service.

    (d) The appellant will be notified of the decision on his or her appeal in writing or by email within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) from the date of receipt by SSS of the individual's request for review unless the  extends the 20 days period for good cause. The extension and the reasons therefore will be sent by SSS to the requester within the initial 20-day period. Such extensions should not be routine and should not normally exceed an additional 30 days. If the decision affirms the adverse determination in whole or in part, the notification will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmation, including any exemptions applied, and will inform the appellant of the Privacy Act provisions for judicial review of the appellate authority's decision, a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with SSS setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision, and the procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement. The Director of Selective Service has the authority to determine the  of the statement,  the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper, concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will be clearly noted so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent, which shall include a copy of the concise statement furnished and a concise statement by SSS setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SSS chooses to file such a statement. A notation of a dispute is required to be made only if an individual informs SSS of their disagreement with its determination in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. A copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, SSS's statement will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). If the reviewing official determines that the record should be amended in accord with the individual's request, SSS will promptly correct the record, advise the individual, and inform previous recipients if an accounting of the disclosure was made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). The notification of correction pertains to information actually disclosed. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified, in whole or in part, the appellant will be notified in writing of this decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.

    (e) In order to seek a judicial review of a denial of a request for access to records, a requester must first file an appeal under this section.

    (f) An appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of litigation.

    § 1665.6   Schedule of fees.

#### § § 1665.6

    (a)  Individuals will not be charged for:

    (1) The search and review of the record.

    (2) Any copies of the record produced as a necessary part of the process of making the record available for access, or

    (i) Subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or

    (ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.

    (4) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would—

    § 1699.140   Employment.

#### § § 1699.140

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

#### § §§ 1699.141-1699.148

    § 1699.149   Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1699.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1699.150, no qualified handicapped persons shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subject to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1699.150   Program accessibility: existing facilities.

#### § § 1699.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1699.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4141 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, at the time, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the officials responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 1699.151   Program accessibility: new construction and alterations.

#### § § 1699.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handcapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 14-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

#### § § 1699.160

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aid where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1699.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
