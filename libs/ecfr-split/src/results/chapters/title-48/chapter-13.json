In case any material or workmanship furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the Government.

The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the particular service application, filler material type, position of welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A welder may be required to re-qualify if the Contracting Officer believes there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welders' qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).\n",

A reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine railway. All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be cleaned, washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the contractor if and to the extent necessary as required by good marine practice or by current Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be furnished with a “gas free” or “safe for hot work” or “safe for workers” certificate before any hot work or entry is done. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.\n",

The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.\n",
                          "(h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.\n",

Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise, discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications, it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting Officer. The Government is not liable for any claims or charges resulting from additional work performed by the contractor as a result of a patent ambiguity in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications that was not brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes and dimensions of parts furnished by the contractor under the contract.\n",

                          "(k) While in drydock or on a marine railway, the contractor shall be responsible for the closing, before the end of working hours, of all valves and openings upon which work is being done by its workers when such closing is practicable. The contractor shall establish a list and keep the COR cognizant of the closure status of all valves and openings upon which the contractor's workers have been working.\n",

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.\n",
                          "(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:\n",

                          "(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.\n",
                          "(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).\n",

If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.\n",
                          "(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:\n",

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00.

Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.\n",

Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.\n",

In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, however, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.\n",

The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event."
